Prior\nwork has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic\nfairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this\nsetting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a\nnatural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.\nWe begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any\npositive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This\nis surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and\na natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under\nadditional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of\nnon-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of\nlearning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the\nsimple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation\nwith high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust\napproximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item\nvalue (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as\nEF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions."}

This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation\nproblem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its\ninvestment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,\nand reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.\nThis encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the\nobservation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this\nuncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect.

However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic,\nand existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal\nperformance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns\nshift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional\nLSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions\n(i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for\ncontinuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight\ncompaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal\naction from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we\nimplement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB.

These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition\nnumber between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to\nthe MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge\nthe performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based\nsolvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key\ninsights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers."}

However, the rules governing evolution of\ncomplexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,\nwhere complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal\ncomplexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a\nmathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal\ncomplexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical\nisomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between\nthe replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types\ncorresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to\nlikelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization\nprevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity\nmatches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over\nto the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity\nevolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too\nsimple organisms suffering from \\textit{overfitness} and \\textit{underfitness},\nrespectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal\nadditional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments\ndecrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both\nevolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between\nover-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient\nflexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of\noptimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure.

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity.

However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on\ninstances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other\ndomains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic\nbenchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches."}

Multi-vector approaches\npioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual\ntoken embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This\narchitecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced\nout-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex\nretrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear\ntheoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late\ninteraction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,\nprimarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and\nexperimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a\nstreamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support\nmulti-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,\nadvanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal\ncode changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering\nmulti-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to\naccelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,\nthereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems.

Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach\nbegins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces\nnatural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable\ncode. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal\nsolutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic\nfiltering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each\ndataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization\nproblem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal\nsolution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that\nshow how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling\nlanguages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically\ntailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce\nOptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from\nnatural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,\nmulti-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the\nproposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of\nAD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments"}

Such representations tend to\nobscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with\ninternal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory\nepistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief\nstrength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states\nthan existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches."}

For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training.

In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+.

However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM."}

(2) Their reliance on random data\naugmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a\nstructure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of\nconventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware\naugmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and\nsemantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing\nobjectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture\nlong-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph\ncontrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without\ncompromising representation quality.

In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.
