Prior\nwork has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic\nfairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this\nsetting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a\nnatural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.\nWe begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any\npositive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This\nis surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and\na natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under\nadditional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of\nnon-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of\nlearning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the\nsimple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation\nwith high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust\napproximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item\nvalue (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as\nEF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions."}

However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic,\nand existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal\nperformance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns\nshift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional\nLSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions\n(i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for\ncontinuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight\ncompaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal\naction from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we\nimplement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB.

These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition\nnumber between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to\nthe MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge\nthe performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based\nsolvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key\ninsights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers."}

However, the rules governing evolution of\ncomplexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,\nwhere complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal\ncomplexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a\nmathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal\ncomplexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical\nisomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between\nthe replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types\ncorresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to\nlikelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization\nprevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity\nmatches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over\nto the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity\nevolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too\nsimple organisms suffering from \\textit{overfitness} and \\textit{underfitness},\nrespectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal\nadditional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments\ndecrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both\nevolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between\nover-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient\nflexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of\noptimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure.

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity.

However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on\ninstances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other\ndomains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic\nbenchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches."}

Multi-vector approaches\npioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual\ntoken embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This\narchitecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced\nout-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex\nretrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear\ntheoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late\ninteraction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,\nprimarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and\nexperimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a\nstreamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support\nmulti-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,\nadvanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal\ncode changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering\nmulti-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to\naccelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,\nthereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems.

The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a\ncentralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be\nthe foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields."}

Such representations tend to\nobscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with\ninternal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory\nepistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits.

We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples\n(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A\ntwo-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the\naugmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high\nclassification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially\noutperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present\ndetailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier\nperformance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture\ndiagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based\nsynthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction\nperformance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes."}

However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM."}

(2) Their reliance on random data\naugmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a\nstructure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of\nconventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware\naugmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and\nsemantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing\nobjectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture\nlong-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph\ncontrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without\ncompromising representation quality.

Unlike static\nvisual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram\n- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a\nsimple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics\nwhen applied to the entire input.\n  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose\nPatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and\nindependently augmenting each patch.

MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem."}

Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code\nand dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier."}
