Contrary to the common approach of applying variance-based (Sobol') sensitivity analysis elementwise, multivariate sensitivity analysis provides a single sensitivity index per parameter, thus allowing for a holistic estimation of parameter importance over the full efficiency map or profile. Its benefits are demonstrated on permanent magnet synchronous machine models of different fidelity. Computations based on Monte Carlo sampling and polynomial chaos expansions are compared in terms of computational cost. The sensitivity analysis results are subsequently used to simplify the models, by fixing non-influential parameters to their nominal values and allowing random variations only for influential parameters. Uncertainty estimates obtained with the full and reduced models confirm the validity of model simplification guided by multivariate sensitivity analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u591a\u5143\u5168\u5c40\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u56fe\u548c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6c38\u78c1\u540c\u6b65\u7535\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b80\u5316\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u56fe\u6216\u66f2\u7ebf\u6574\u4f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5143\u5168\u5c40\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6df7\u6c8c\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u975e\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u6570\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5143\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u4e00\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5143\u5168\u5c40\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Despite its promise in aerospace, automotive, and other high-performance applications, current GD methods face critical challenges: AI approaches require large datasets and often struggle to generalize; topology optimization is computationally intensive and difficult to extend to multiphysics problems; and model order reduction for evolving geometries remains underdeveloped. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified, structure-preserving framework for GD based on optimal transport (OT), enabling simultaneous interpolation of complex geometries and their associated physical solution fields across evolving design spaces, even with non-matching meshes and substantial shape changes. This capability leverages Gaussian splatting to provide a continuous, mesh-independent representation of the solution and Wasserstein barycenters to enable smooth, mathematically ''mass''-preserving blending of geometries, offering a major advance over surrogate models tied to static meshes. Our framework efficiently interpolates positive scalar fields across arbitrarily shaped, evolving geometries without requiring identical mesh topology or dimensionality. OT also naturally preserves localized physical features -- such as stress concentrations or sharp gradients -- by conserving the spatial distribution of quantities, interpreted as ''mass'' in a mathematical sense, rather than averaging them, avoiding artificial smoothing. Preliminary extensions to signed and vector fields are presented. Representative test cases demonstrate enhanced efficiency, adaptability, and physical fidelity, establishing a foundation for future foundation-model-powered generative design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728AI\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u9636\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4fdd\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u70b9\u548cWasserstein\u91cd\u5fc3\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u573a\u63d2\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8de8\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u6f14\u53d8\u51e0\u4f55\u63d2\u503c\u6b63\u6807\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eOT\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7531\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In conjunction with this suite, a novel performance metric is introduced, which employs random sampling as a statistical reference, providing nonlinear normalization of objective values and enabling unbiased comparison of algorithmic efficiency across heterogeneous problems. Using this framework, 20 deterministic and stochastic optimization methods were systematically evaluated through hundreds of independent runs per problem, ensuring statistical robustness.

Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks.

This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u8003\u8651\u79d1\u7814\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOmniScientist\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d1\u7814\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u79d1\u7814\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u521b\u65b0\u751f\u6001\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u79d1\u7814\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u534f\u4f5c\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6001\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u79d1\u7814\u793e\u533a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OmniScientist\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5230AI\u79d1\u7814\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5305\u62ec\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniScientist\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

This lack of structure challenges interoperability, making data integration, validation, and reuse difficult. LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language) is an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data. LinkML can describe a range of data structures, from flat, list-based models to complex, interrelated, and normalized models that utilize polymorphism and compound inheritance. It offers an approachable syntax that is not tied to any one technical architecture and can be integrated seamlessly with many existing frameworks. The LinkML syntax provides a standard way to describe schemas, classes, and relationships, allowing modelers to build well-defined, stable, and optionally ontology-aligned data structures. Once defined, LinkML schemas may be imported into other LinkML schemas. These key features make LinkML an accessible platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and a reliable way to define and share data semantics.\n  LinkML helps reduce heterogeneity, complexity, and the proliferation of single-use data models while simultaneously enabling compliance with FAIR data standards. LinkML has seen increasing adoption in various fields, including biology, chemistry, biomedicine, microbiome research, finance, electrical engineering, transportation, and commercial software development.

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns.

We model this problem as a minimax game: the minimizer aims to choose a panel that minimizes the loss, i.e., the deviation of the ultimate panel from predefined representation targets. Then, an adversary defines a distribution over dropouts from which the realized dropouts are drawn. Our main contribution is an efficient loss-minimizing algorithm, which remains optimal as we vary the maximizer's power from worst case to average case. Our algorithm - which iteratively plays a projected gradient descent subroutine against an efficient algorithm for computing the best-response dropout distribution - also addresses a key open question in the area: how to manage dropouts while ensuring that each potential panelist is chosen with relatively equal probabilities.

Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $\u03b5$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-\u03b5$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/\u03b4)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $\u03b4$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $\u03b4$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $\u03b4$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/\u03b4)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $\u03b4$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity.

As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.\n  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems.

A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service.

BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior.\n  To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes.\n  We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency.

The approach employs a delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) algorithm that uses a surrogate target kernel and a proposal distribution derived from an approximate conditional posterior, thereby exploiting the structure of the quasi-likelihood. Two implementations are introduced. DA-MCMC-Exact fully incorporates prior information into the proposal distribution and maximizes per-iteration efficiency, whereas DA-MCMC-Approx omits the prior in the proposal to reduce matrix inversions, improving numerical stability and computational speed in higher dimensions. Simulation studies on heteroskedastic linear regressions show substantial gains over standard MCMC and conventional DA-MCMC baselines, measured by multivariate effective sample size per iteration and per second. The Approx variant yields the best overall throughput, while the Exact variant attains the highest per-iteration efficiency. Applications to two empirical instrumental variable regressions corroborate these findings: the Approx implementation scales to larger designs where other methods become impractical, while still delivering precise inference. Although developed for moment-based quasi-posteriors, the proposed approach also extends to risk-based quasi-Bayesian formulations when first-order conditions are linear and can be transformed analogously.

This paper moves beyond traditional stock market indices to examine cross-sectional return distributions-15 in our empirical application, each representing a distinct global market. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting an overlooked policy transmission.

We ask whether axiomatic no-arbitrage laws, imposed as soft penalties on a learned world model, can reliably align high-capacity RL agents, or mainly create Goodhart-style incentives to exploit model errors. From classical static no-arbitrage conditions we build a finite-dimensional convex volatility law manifold of admissible total-variance surfaces, together with a metric law-penalty functional and a Graceful Failure Index (GFI) that normalizes law degradation under shocks. A synthetic generator produces law-consistent trajectories, while a recurrent neural world model trained without law regularization exhibits structured off-manifold errors. On this testbed we define a Goodhart decomposition \\(r = r^{\\mathcal{M}} + r^\\perp\\), where \\(r^\\perp\\) is ghost arbitrage from off-manifold prediction error. We prove a ghost-arbitrage incentive theorem for PPO-type agents, a law-strength trade-off theorem showing that stronger penalties eventually worsen P\\&L, and a no-free-lunch theorem: under a law-consistent world model and law-aligned strategy class, unconstrained law-seeking RL cannot Pareto-dominate structural baselines on P\\&L, penalties, and GFI. In experiments on an SPX/VIX-like world model, simple structural strategies form the empirical law-strength frontier, while all law-seeking RL variants underperform and move into high-penalty, high-GFI regions.

However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility.

Isolation levels offer a configurable mechanism to manage the interaction between concurrent transactions, enabling varying degrees of consistency and performance trade-offs. These isolation guarantees are supported by all major RDBMSs. However, testing transaction behavior under different isolation levels remains a significant challenge due to two primary reasons. First, automatically generating test transactions that can effectively expose bugs in transaction handling logic is non-trivial, as such bugs are typically triggered under specific transactional constraints. Second, detecting logic anomalies in transaction outcomes is difficult because the correct execution results are often unknown for randomly generated transactions. To address these challenges, we propose an anomaly pattern-guided testing approach for uncovering transaction bugs in RDBMSs. Our solution tackles the first challenge by introducing a test case generation technique guided by predefined anomaly patterns, which increases the likelihood of exposing transactional bugs. For the second challenge, we present a two-phase detection process, involving explicit error detection and implicit error detection, to identify bugs in transaction execution. We have implemented our approach in a tool, APTrans, and evaluated it on three widely-used RDBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, and OceanBase.

While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

The sensitivity of an algorithm $A$ on a graph $G$ is defined as the maximum Wasserstein distance between the output distributions of $A$ on $G$ and on $G - e$, where $G - e$ is the graph obtained by deleting an edge $e$ from $G$. The maximum is taken over all edges $e$, and the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance is the Hamming distance.\n  We first show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $\u0394^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, where $\u0394$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. The algorithm is based on sampling from the Gibbs distribution over matchings and runs in time $O_{\\varepsilon, \u0394}(m \\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. This result significantly improves the previously known sensitivity bounds.\n  Next, we present significantly faster algorithms for planar and bipartite graphs as a function of $\\varepsilon$ and $\u0394$, which run in time $\\mathrm{poly}(n/\\varepsilon)$. This improvement is achieved by designing a more efficient algorithm for sampling matchings from the Gibbs distribution in these graph classes, which improves upon the previous best in terms of running time.\n  Finally, for general graphs with potentially unbounded maximum degree, we show that there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $\\sqrt{n} \\cdot (\\varepsilon^{-1} \\log n)^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, improving upon the previous best bound of $O(n^{1/(1+\\varepsilon^2)})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5df2\u6709\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ece\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "1. \u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u03b5>0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u0394^O(1/\u03b5)\u7684(1 - \u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4O_\u03b5,\u0394(m log m)\u30022. \u5bf9\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3apoly(n/\u03b5)\u7684\u66f4\u5feb\u7b97\u6cd5\u30023. \u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u221an\u22c5(\u03b5^(-1) log n)^O(1/\u03b5)\u7684(1 - \u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360\u00b0. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdBench360\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c360\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u6846\u67b6\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u591a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76ee\u6807\u7a84\u4e14\u975e\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6613\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBench360\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0a\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u9700\u8981Bench360\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The empirical distributions are sampled every 10 minutes over 976 trading days, and fitted to different models, namely Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, and Log-Normal distributions. Each of these models is parameterized by a shape parameter, $\u03c6$, and a scale parameter, $\u03b8$, which are detrended from their daily average behavior. The time series of the detrended parameters is analyzed using adaptive binning and regression-based extraction of the Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, up to their sixth order, enabling to classification of its intrinsic dynamics. We show that (i) $\u03c6$ is well described as a pure diffusion with a linear mean regression for the Gamma, Inverse Gamma, and Weibull models, while $\u03b8$ shows dominant jump-diffusion dynamics, with an elevated fourth- and sixth-order moment contributions; (ii) the log-normal model shows however the opposite: $\u03b8$ is predominantly diffusive, with $\u03c6$ showing weak jump signatures; (iii) global moment inversion yields jump rates and amplitudes that account for a large share of total variance for $\u03b8$, confirming that rare discontinuities dominate volatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u7ebd\u4ea4\u6240\u80a1\u7968\u91cf\u4ef7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u7ebd\u7ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u80a1\u7968\u91cf\u4ef7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6f14\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u6bcf10\u5206\u949f\u91c7\u6837976\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6613\u65e5\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u62df\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u53bb\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7bb1\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6Kramers - Moyal\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\u03c6\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u03b8\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982Gamma\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u03c6\u4e3a\u7eaf\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u03b8\u4e3a\u8df3\u8dc3 - \u6269\u6563\uff1b\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u5168\u5c40\u77e9\u53cd\u6f14\u8868\u660e\u03b8\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u5bf9\u603b\u65b9\u5dee\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u6709\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u3002"}}

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e38\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5PBGD - Free\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\uff08BLO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u5c0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u5199\u89e3\u8026\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPBGD - Free\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u66f2\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e38\u6570\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u653e\u677e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5c42Lipschitz\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5c0f\u7f5a\u5e38\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ecf\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We present a novel Bayesian fractional posterior framework that fuses seismic waves, crater dimensions, synthetic aperture radar imagery, and vision-language model interpreted ground-level images to estimate the yield of the 2020 Beirut explosion. Unlike conventional approaches that may treat data sources equally, our method learns trust weights for each modality through a Dirichlet prior, automatically calibrating the relative information content of disparate observations. Applied to the Beirut explosion, the framework yields an estimate of 0.34--0.48 kt TNT equivalent, representing 12 to 17 percent detonation efficiency relative to the 2.75 kt theoretical maximum from the blast's stored ammonium nitrate. The fractional posterior approach demonstrates superior uncertainty quantification compared to single-modality estimates while providing robustness against systematic biases.

We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks.

Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCLLMRec\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3MOOC\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MOOC\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6b64\u7c7b\u56fe\u8c31\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLLMRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5148\u4fee\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u7cbe\u6392\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eMOOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCLLMRec\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CLLMRec\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u8ba4\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format.

In this study, we shift the focus from performance maximization to systematic simplification, aiming to identify the minimal computational ingredients required for different model tasks. We examine how many neurons, how much nonlinearity, and which connective structure is necessary and sufficient to perform certain tasks, considering also neurons with non-sigmoidal activation functions and networks with non-random connectivity. Surprisingly, we find non-trivial cases where the readout layer performs the bulk of the computation, with the reservoir merely providing weak nonlinearity and memory.

DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability.

However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \\textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query.

The goal is to decide if a graph that forbids a fixed pattern $H$ as a subgraph contains a triangle, using only \"combinatorial\" methods that notably exclude fast matrix multiplication. Our work aims to classify which patterns admit a subcubic speedup, working towards a dichotomy theorem. On the lower bound side, we show that if $H$ is not $3$-colorable or contains more than one triangle, the complexity of the problem remains unchanged, and no combinatorial speedup is likely possible. On the upper bound side, we develop an embedding approach that results in a strongly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for a rich class of \"embeddable\" patterns. Specifically, for an embeddable pattern of size $k$, our algorithm runs in $\\tilde O(n^{3-\\frac{1}{2^{k-3}}})$ time, where $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ hides poly-logarithmic factors. This algorithm also extends to listing all the triangles within the same time bound. We supplement this main result with two generalizations: 1) A generalization to patterns that are embeddable up to a single obstacle that arises from a triangle in the pattern. This completes our classification for small patterns, yielding a dichotomy theorem for all patterns of size up to eight. 2) An $H$-sensitive algorithm for embeddable patterns, which runs faster when the number of copies of $H$ is significantly smaller than the maximum possible $\u03a9(n^k)$.

To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks.

In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784 - \u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u542b\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6GCL - OT\uff0c\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784 - \u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u786c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f7f\u7ed3\u6784 - \u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGCL - OT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eRealSoftMax\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165OT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6f\u76d1\u7763\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eGCL - OT\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u754c\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e5d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aGCL - OT\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCL - OT\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u3002"}}

However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347VLM\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5e38\u9700\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff08PRF\uff09\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff08GRF\uff09\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u6c47\u603b\u5668\uff08AFS\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "GRF\u3001AFS\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0cAFS\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u67e5\u8be2\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347VLM\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

A standard assumption is that clusters induce well-connected subgraphs (i.e. $\u03a9(1)$-expanders), and form $\u03b5$-sparse cuts. Such a graph defines the clustering uniquely up to $\\approx \u03b5$ misclassification rate, and efficient algorithms for achieving this rate are known. While this vanilla version of graph clustering is well studied, in practice, vertices of the graph are typically equipped with labels that provide additional information on cluster ids of the vertices. For example, each vertex could have a cluster label that is corrupted independently with probability $\u03b4$. Using only one of the two sources of information leads to misclassification rate $\\min\\{\u03b5, \u03b4\\}$, but can they be combined to achieve a rate of $\\approx \u03b5\u03b4$?\n  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a sublinear-time algorithm in the number of vertices $n$. Our key algorithmic insight is a new observation on ``spectrally ambiguous'' vertices in a well-clusterable graph.\n  While our sublinear-time classifier achieves the nearly optimal $\\approx \\widetilde O(\u03b5\u03b4)$ misclassification rate, the approximate clusters that it outputs do not necessarily induce expanders in the graph $G$.

However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

Nonlinear, non-Gaussian mechanistic models are routinely fitted to time series data but seldom to panel data, despite its widespread availability, suggesting that the practical difficulties for existing procedures are prohibitive.

Objective: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable potential in SVA, they still face two major limitations. First, most LLMs are trained on general-purpose corpora and thus lack domain-specific knowledge essential for effective SVA. Second, they tend to rely on shallow pattern matching instead of deep contextual reasoning, making it challenging to fully comprehend complex code semantics and their security implications. Method: To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel framework ReVul-CoT that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting. In ReVul-CoT, the RAG module dynamically retrieves contextually relevant information from a constructed local knowledge base that consolidates vulnerability data from authoritative sources (such as NVD and CWE), along with corresponding code snippets and descriptive information. Building on DeepSeek-V3.1, CoT prompting guides the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning over exploitability, impact scope, and related factors Results: We evaluate ReVul-CoT on a dataset of 12,070 vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that ReVul-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines by 16.50%-42.26% in terms of MCC, and outperforms the best baseline by 10.43%, 15.86%, and 16.50% in Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC, respectively. Our ablation studies further validate the contributions of considering dynamic retrieval, knowledge integration, and CoT-based reasoning.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs.

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving.

ReqSketch (arXiv:2004.01668) is currently the most space-efficient summary with two key properties: relative error guarantees, offering increasingly higher accuracy towards the distribution's tails, and mergeability, allowing distributed or parallel processing of datasets. Due to these features and its simple algorithm design, ReqSketch has been adopted in practice, via implementation in the Apache DataSketches library. However, the proof of mergeability in ReqSketch is overly complicated, requiring an intricate charging argument and complex variance analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined version of ReqSketch, by developing so-called adaptive compactors. This enables a significantly simplified proof of relative error guarantees in the most general mergeability setting, while retaining the original space bound, update time, and algorithmic simplicity.

Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables.

Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting.

We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification.

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources.

It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics.\n  This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity.

While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg.

Repeating all performance measurements after every revision is a cost-intensive task, especially in the presence of configurability, where one has to measure multiple configurations to obtain a comprehensive picture. Configuration sampling is a common approach to control the measurement cost. However, it cannot guarantee completeness and might miss performance regressions, especially if they only affect few configurations. As an alternative to solve the cost reduction problem, we present ConfFLARE: ConfFLARE estimates whether a change potentially impacts performance by identifying data-flow interactions with performance-relevant code and extracts which software features participate in such interactions. Based on these features, we can select a subset of relevant configurations to focus performance profiling efforts on. In a study conducted on both, synthetic and real-world software systems, ConfFLARE correctly detects performance regressions in almost all cases and identifies relevant features in all but two cases, reducing the number of configurations to be tested on average by $79\\%$ for synthetic and by $70\\%$ for real-world regression scenarios saving hours of performance testing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9891\u7e41\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51faConfFLARE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9891\u7e41\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9057\u6f0f\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConfFLARE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u66f4\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u914d\u7f6e\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6240\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u9664\u4e24\u4f8b\u5916\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f79%\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f70%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u5927\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ConfFLARE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data.

This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations.

Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

Further, the AlphaProof initiative has demonstrated the possibility of using AI for general mathematical reasoning. Reasoning about computer programs (software) can be accomplished via general mathematical reasoning; however, it tends to be more structured and richer in contexts. This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI.\n  In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.\n  Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406AutoRocq\uff0c\u80fd\u8fb9\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4e0eAI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u6d41\u884c\u53caAI\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u7528AI\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoRocq\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eRocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728SV - COMP\u57fa\u51c6\u548cLinux\u5185\u6838\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAutoRocq\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bc1\u660e\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u671b\u4e0eAI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\u613f\u666f\u3002"}}

The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards.

We analyzed SATD in 27 scientific and general-purpose repositories across multiple domains and languages. We fine-tuned and compared 10 transformer-based models (100M-7B parameters) on 67,066 labeled code comments.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08ordinal - CP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u8d2fCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u8d2fCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6 - \u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5171\u5f62\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad815%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems.

Trouble Reports (TRs), which document issues in Ericsson's production system, play a critical role in facilitating the timely resolution of software faults. However, the complexity and volume of TR data, along with the presence of diverse criteria that reflect different aspects of each fault, present challenges for retrieval systems. Building on prior work at Ericsson, which utilized a two-stage workflow, comprising Initial Retrieval (IR) and Re-Ranking (RR) stages, this study investigates different TR observation criteria and their impact on the performance of retrieval models. We propose \\textbf{CREST} (\\textbf{C}riteria-specific \\textbf{R}etrieval via \\textbf{E}nsemble of \\textbf{S}pecialized \\textbf{T}R models), a criterion-driven retrieval approach that leverages specialized models for different TR fields to improve both effectiveness and interpretability, thereby enabling quicker fault resolution and supporting software maintenance. CREST utilizes specialized models trained on specific TR criteria and aggregates their outputs to capture diverse and complementary signals. This approach leads to enhanced retrieval accuracy, better calibration of predicted scores, and improved interpretability by providing relevance scores for each criterion, helping users understand why specific TRs were retrieved. Using a subset of Ericsson's internal TRs, this research demonstrates that criterion-specific models significantly outperform a single model approach across key evaluation metrics.

This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).\n  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.\n  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds.

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE.

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u516b\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u63a2\u9488\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u9488\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u6545\u610f\u653e\u6c34\u63a2\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6570\u4f4e\u4e8e\u540c\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u57df\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies.

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

In this paper, we define a concept of talent breakout and propose a method to detect Japanese talents before their rise to stardom. The main focus of the study is to determine the effectiveness of combining Twitter and TV data on predicting time-dependent changes in social data. Although traditional time-series models are known to be robust in many applications, the success of neural network models in various fields (e.g.\\ Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning) continues to spark an interest in the time-series community to apply new techniques in practice.

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.\n  To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.\n  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels.

We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEliDecide\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8fb9\u754c\u4e3a\u7403\u5f62\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEliDecide\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u692d\u7403\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u610f\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u692d\u7403\u8fb9\u754c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTree of Claims (ToC)\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MCTS\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8d77\u8349\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7ec6\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7531EditorAgent\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u8bae\uff0cExaminerAgent\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57281145\u6761\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cToC\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u9ad88%\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe9%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToC\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eMCTS\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e9a\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5e93\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97WCA\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bcd\u5e93\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CG\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5e93\u96c6\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bcd - \u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08WCA\uff09\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bcd\u5e93\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5FIRM\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u826f\u597d\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFIRM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u4e00\u7ec4\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u9a7b\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u8861\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated.

We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering.

Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods.

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528Kaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bGPU\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5b9a\u5f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u5f15\u53d1\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Kaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08FLOPs\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bGPU\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u8017\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08R\u5e73\u65b9>0.9\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u6a21\u578b - \u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u9760\u4f30\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects.

However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps.

Here we propose TS-DFM, a flow matching framework that predicts TSs from reactants and products. By operating in molecular distance geometry space, TS-DFM explicitly captures the dynamic changes of interatomic distances in chemical reactions. A network structure named TSDVNet is designed to learn the velocity field for generating TS geometries accurately. On the benchmark dataset Transition1X, TS-DFM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method React-OT by 30\\% in structural accuracy.

However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D).

Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time.

SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347CLIP\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSaFeR - CLIP\u6846\u67b6\u548cNSFW - Caps\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SaFeR - CLIP\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8d21\u732eNSFW - Caps\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "SaFeR - CLIP\u80fd\u4f7f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe8.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0a\u91cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation.

Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies.

Central to our analysis is a coherence measure that quantifies how gradient curvature aligns across data points, revealing why certain minima are stable and favored during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53d7\u9752\u7750\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46SGD\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790SGD\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u548cSAM\u5728\u4e24\u5c42ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u91cf\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u66f2\u7387\u5728\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3SGD\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u67d0\u4e9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002"}}

However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations.

Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency.

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInTAct\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u5148\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165InTAct\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DomainNet\u548cImageNet - R\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInTAct\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "InTAct\u5728\u4e0d\u51bb\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u5b58\u50a8\u8fc7\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.

Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis.

To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes.

These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns\" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries.

Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance.

Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications.

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers.

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions.

The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams.

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7a00\u758fCSI\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6062\u590d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u5faa\u73af - \u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574CSI\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d8530%\uff0c\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \\in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \\{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \\cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \\}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \\in \\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \\log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values.

In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains.

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors.

First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u914d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM2Comp\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u66f4\u7701\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u56fa\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u548c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6807\u8bb0\u66ff\u4ee3\u6574\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u826f\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0cLLM2Comp\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e14\u66f4\u7701\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM2Comp\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d41\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0cAI\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6355\u6349\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u534a\u7403\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7e41\u6b96\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u5927\u96c6\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a2022\u5e748\u6708\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u621050\u4e2a\u6210\u5458\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u5408\u6280\u5de7\u3002", "result": "\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d41\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u79bb\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9884\u62a5\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bAI\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6355\u6349\u6bd4\u964d\u6c34\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d41\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6216\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u9760AI\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns.

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f03\u6743\u6846\u67b6ABCA\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u5f03\u6743\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u540e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u524d\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ABCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u5f03\u6743\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cABCA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ABCA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAGFF\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u542b\u4e49\uff1b\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Attention - Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAGFF\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u6027\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cAGFF\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring).

Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.\n  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.\n  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness.

While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton.

When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5ef6\u7eedCroCo\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6269\u5c55MAE\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMuM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eDINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u4e8e3D\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MAE\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u610f\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63a9\u7801\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u56fe\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u5e27\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "MuM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u524d\u9988\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eDINOv3\u548cCroCo v2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u4e8e3D\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format.

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset.

To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR.

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges.

In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%.

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $\u03c0_0$-FAST and $\u03c0_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\\times$ fewer robot demonstrations.

However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMusicAIR\u6846\u67b6\u53caGenAIM\u5de5\u5177\u7528\u4e8eAI\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7248\u6743\u4fb5\u6743\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMusicAIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u4e50\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fde\u63a5\u6b4c\u8bcd\u548c\u8282\u594f\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u5bfc\u97f3\u4e50\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1GenAIM\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u97f3\u4e50\u6307\u6807\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u952e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fbe85%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u66f2\u5bb6\u768479%\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u97f3\u4e50\u7406\u8bba\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAIM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u52a9\u624b\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u5bfc\u5e08\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u97f3\u4e50\u751f\u6210\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8.

This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs.

Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DIF - V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u516c\u5e73\u9762\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u9762\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DIF - V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8eab\u4efd\u98ce\u683c\u4fee\u6539\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: \"Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?\". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention.

Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency.

In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches.

REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol.

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SketchVerify\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u955c\u5934\u89c4\u5212\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSketchVerify\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5bf9\u5176\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u8349\u56fe\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u7ec8\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728WorldModelBench\u548cPhyWorldBench\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5019\u9009\u6570\u91cf\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SketchVerify\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection.
