### [1] [CATArena: Evaluation of LLM Agents through Iterative Tournament Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852)
*Lingyue Fu,Xin Ding,Yaoming Zhu,Shao Zhang,Lin Qiu,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Jiaxin Ding,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文强调学习能力对大语言模型（LLM）智能体进化的重要性，提出迭代竞争的对等学习框架，引入CATArena评估平台，实验证明其能可靠、稳定且可扩展地评估智能体核心能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准主要评估固定场景的端到端性能，存在分数饱和、依赖专家标注等问题，需评估智能体学习能力。

Method: 提出迭代竞争的对等学习框架，引入CATArena锦标赛式评估平台。

Result: 涉及最小和商业代码智能体的实验结果表明，CATArena能为智能体核心能力提供可靠、稳定和可扩展的基准测试。

Conclusion: CATArena可对智能体核心能力，特别是学习能力和策略编码进行有效评估。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学材料压缩推理导致验证困难和跨领域链接受阻的问题。

Method: 引入可扩展框架，采用端点驱动、还原论策略，生成问题，多模型生成LCoTs并过滤，用验证语料驱动搜索引擎和合成器。

Result: SciencePedia包含约200,000条细粒度条目，Plato合成文章在知识密度和事实错误率上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 基于可验证LCoT知识库的推理中心方法能实现大规模可信跨领域科学综合，为不断扩展的百科全书奠定基础。

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Conclusion: 指出Denario优势与局限，探讨AI科研伦理及与科学哲学关系。

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and
the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络物理系统中基础模型引入新错误导致决策失误的问题。

Method: 引入认知信封概念，为AI决策建立推理边界，并结合元认知和传统安全信封。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 认知信封需要实际的指导方针和系统化的定义、验证及保障流程。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

### [6] [Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009)
*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究在国际象棋领域语言模型使用因果掩码处理空间数据的可行性，发现空间数据用因果掩码训练模型效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 很少有研究直接探讨在非序列数据上接受因果掩码带来的信息损失是否可行，且少有领域能提供同一数据集的空间和序列表示，而国际象棋领域具备此条件。

Method: 在国际象棋领域，对空间（基于棋盘）和序列（基于走法）数据分别使用双向和因果自注意力机制训练语言模型。

Result: 基于空间棋盘状态训练的模型，即使使用因果掩码，表现也比基于序列数据训练的模型更强。

Conclusion: 对空间数据应用因果掩码是训练单峰大语言模型的可行方法，在某些领域比序列化更优。

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应努力控制方法，可让用户动态调整成本 - 准确性权衡，减少思维链长度并维持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难让用户对特定查询的思考量进行细粒度控制，需提前知晓问题难度来设置令牌预算。

Method: 提出自适应努力控制的自适应强化学习方法，训练模型使用相对于当前平均思维链长度的用户指定令牌比例。

Result: 消除了特定数据集和阶段的调优，产生更好的成本 - 准确性权衡曲线，可动态调整权衡，模型自动按任务难度分配资源，减少约3倍思维链长度并维持或提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决现有问题，在不同规模模型上表现良好。

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

### [8] [LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18477)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LAFA系统集成基于大语言模型代理的数据分析与联邦分析，接受自然语言查询并转化为优化的联邦分析工作流，实验显示其性能优于基线策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型代理的分析框架缺乏隐私保护，联邦分析不支持自然语言输入，需结合两者优势。

Method: 引入分层多代理架构，粗粒度规划器分解复杂查询，细粒度规划器将子查询映射为有向无环图，优化器代理重写和合并图以提高效率。

Result: LAFA在执行计划成功率上表现更好，大幅减少资源密集型的联邦分析操作。

Conclusion: 为支持自然语言输入的隐私保护、大语言模型驱动的联邦分析奠定了实践基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

Result: 替换路由模型后准确率达96%，模型大小缩小10倍，延迟降低70%；查询重述微调后准确率提升3.7%，延迟降低40%。

Conclusion: 在数据飞轮中结构化的人工反馈可将企业AI代理转变为自我改进系统，该工作为构建强大、自适应企业AI代理提供可重复蓝图。

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

Conclusion: 提出的代理工作流能有效解决模型批改证明题时部分分数分配的校准问题，有助于提升批改质量。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: 结合推理大语言模型和结构化实验，AI可解决复杂系统问题并产生有创意、可理解的设计。

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Motivation: 传统线性产品生命周期模型因产品网络化而达极限，需新方法应对跨学科互操作性等关键因素。

Method: 基于当前文献、行业经验及特定领域，分类现状，提出参考框架、四项原则和三步路线图。

Result: 实现更高的变更鲁棒性、更短的吞吐量时间、更好的重用性以及更明智的可持续性决策。

Conclusion: 所提方法可帮助决策者和从业者管理复杂性，设计可扩展的SoS价值流。

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型个性化参数适应方法在处理动态用户模式和高数据稀疏性场景存在局限，需有效个性化技术。

Method: 提出细粒度实例定制转向框架，动态生成样本级干扰向量注入模型前向传播，有细粒度转向组件和输入感知聚合模块。

Result: 方法在快速变化分布和高数据稀疏场景表现出色，在多场景实验中显著提升个性化性能，保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法灵活高效，与现有方法正交，是可兼容不同个性化技术的插件组件。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型用于GUI导航代理时，存在跨领域泛化和有效利用历史信息的局限性。

Method: 提出集成结构化推理、动作预测和历史总结的框架；基于该框架，通过在伪标签轨迹上进行监督微调以及使用GRPO进行强化学习来训练GUI - Rise；采用包含历史感知目标的特殊奖励。

Result: 在相同训练数据条件下的标准基准测试中取得了SOTA结果，在域外场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 框架能够在不同的GUI导航任务中保持强大的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

TL;DR: 本文提出三种奖励机器（RMs）的泛化形式及新的组合学习算法CoRM，实验表明CoRM在长周期无序子任务问题上优于现有RM算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RMs的学习方法不适用于长周期无序子任务问题，信息学习量会随子任务数量指数级增长。

Method: 引入三种RMs的泛化形式，即Numeric RMs、Agenda RMs和Coupled RMs，并提出基于Coupled RMs的新组合学习算法CoRM。

Result: 实验显示CoRM在长周期无序子任务问题上比现有RM算法有更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法有效解决了现有RMs在长周期无序子任务问题上的局限性。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Result: 得到聚焦且可解释的模型，揭示理想和不理想执行的驱动因素，该方法在多个实际事件日志上评估有效。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效分离和可视化关键流程模式，工具已公开。

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Conclusion: 关于大语言模型对该问题贡献的说法有局限性，评估LLM输出科学价值需严格验证和情境化。

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

Motivation: 因多模态信息复杂多样，让多模态大语言模型在推理时灵活高效使用外部工具是待探索挑战。

Method: 引入ToolScope框架，包含Global Navigator、Agentic Executor和Response Synthesizer三个主要组件，通过集成外部工具增强局部感知。

Result: 在四个VQA基准测试中，ToolScope表现出强泛化能力，所有数据集平均性能提升最高达6.69%。

Conclusion: ToolScope框架能有效提升多模态大语言模型在推理时利用外部工具的能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

Conclusion: 含人类约束的多智能体强化学习是模拟真实道路用户交互的有前景建模方法。

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Conclusion: 该工作为复杂人机协作中解决用户意图不确定性提供了有原则、可扩展和自适应的范式。

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，DeepCompress始终优于基线方法，在提高准确性的同时显著提升了标记效率。

Conclusion: DeepCompress框架能有效同时提升大推理模型的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Result: 合成数据远超现有方法，训练模型在MathVista和GeoQA几何解题任务上超越GPT - 4o和领先开源模型。

Conclusion: GeoFM方法有效，合成的几何数据可提升模型在几何问题解决上的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

Motivation: 现有提升大语言模型推理能力的方法存在缺陷，如临时生成数据集有偏差且无法验证，Lean系统不适合基于决策链的任务，导致性能和基准有用性不足。

Method: 引入TempoBench，使用时间轨迹评估（TTE）和时间因果评估（TCE）两个评估基准来分解推理能力。

Conclusion: TempoBench可用于系统分析大语言模型的推理能力，现有大语言模型在复杂系统推理方面有待提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

Conclusion: 多智能体按需知识集成显著提高推理准确性和效率，为复杂知识密集型问题解决提供可扩展方法。

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis

benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

Conclusion: VeriMoA无需昂贵训练，能让小模型达到大模型和微调模型的效果。

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 探讨新兴的代理式人工智能系统，给出合理定义并分析其成功要素。

Result: 发现代理式人工智能系统主要是应用程序，其成功依赖终端用户和主要利益相关者验证，合适验证下基础模型可被更简单模型替代。

Conclusion: 代理式人工智能注重有效性，大语言模型只是实现途径之一。

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Motivation: 解决当前训练大语言模型代理在长周期、领域特定任务上的难题，现有方法存在成本高或易崩溃的问题。

Method: 引入Apollo采样框架，结合异步人工指导与动作级数据过滤，人工在代理偏离轨迹时干预，再用监督控制过滤次优动作。

Conclusion: 强调人工参与采样的关键作用和Apollo处理长周期、领域特定任务设计的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Conclusion: MolChord有潜力成为基于结构的药物设计的实用工具。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge
across scientific and engineering domains. Traditional numerical integrators
often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while
existing neural network-based approaches typically require training a separate
model for each case. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel
multi-modal foundation model for large-scale simulations of differential
equations: FMint-SDE (Foundation Model based on Initialization for stochastic
differential equations). Based on a decoder-only transformer with in-context
learning, FMint-SDE leverages numerical and textual modalities to learn a
universal error-correction scheme. It is trained using prompted sequences of
coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers, enabling broad
generalization across diverse systems. We evaluate our models on a suite of
challenging SDE benchmarks spanning applications in molecular dynamics,
mechanical systems, finance, and biology. Experimental results show that our
approach achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to classical
solvers, underscoring the potential of FMint-SDE as a general-purpose
simulation tool for dynamical systems.

Motivation: LLM服务系统处理异构查询工作负载时，现有缓存策略存在问题，如向量数据库排除长尾、统一缓存策略有缺陷，导致部分流量未缓存。

Method: 提出类别感知语义缓存，采用混合架构分离内存中HNSW搜索和外部文档存储，使用自适应负载策略。

Result: 将未命中成本从30ms降至2ms，使低命中率类别在3 - 5%达到收支平衡，理论上可减少过载模型流量9 - 17%。

Conclusion: 类别感知语义缓存和自适应策略能有效提高缓存覆盖率，应对LLM服务系统的异构查询工作负载。

Abstract: LLM serving systems process heterogeneous query workloads where different
categories exhibit different characteristics. Code queries cluster densely in
embedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content
staleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query
repetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation),
producing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories
achieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve
5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote
search costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of
production traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem:
fixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid
paraphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This
paper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds,
TTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture
separating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss
cost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories
economically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage
across the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend
this framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting
thresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in
theoretical projections.

Result: 在BIRD数据集上对十种Text - to - SQL方法评估，表明测试法常忽略差异，验证结果揭示评估更复杂情况。

Conclusion: 现有测试法评估Text - to - SQL有局限性，新评估流程有意义。

Abstract: Community-driven Text-to-SQL evaluation platforms play a pivotal role in
tracking the state of the art of Text-to-SQL performance. The reliability of
the evaluation process is critical for driving progress in the field. Current
evaluation methods are largely test-based, which involves comparing the
execution results of a generated SQL query and a human-labeled ground-truth on
a static test database. Such an evaluation is optimistic, as two queries can
coincidentally produce the same output on the test database while actually
being different. In this work, we propose a new alternative evaluation
pipeline, called SpotIt, where a formal bounded equivalence verification engine
actively searches for a database that differentiates the generated and
ground-truth SQL queries. We develop techniques to extend existing verifiers to
support a richer SQL subset relevant to Text-to-SQL. A performance evaluation
of ten Text-to-SQL methods on the high-profile BIRD dataset suggests that
test-based methods can often overlook differences between the generated query
and the ground-truth. Further analysis of the verification results reveals a
more complex picture of the current Text-to-SQL evaluation.

Motivation: 工业和物联网环境中时间序列数据量大，数据压缩虽可降成本提性能，但会影响分析准确性，需了解权衡关系以制定数据策略。

Method: 通过理论分析、模拟信号压缩和实证评估。

Result: 过度压缩会丢失关键模式、扭曲统计指标、降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 提出在分析完整性和压缩效率之间取得平衡的最佳方法和实践。

Abstract: In industrial and IoT environments, massive amounts of real-time and
historical process data are continuously generated and archived. With sensors
and devices capturing every operational detail, the volume of time-series data
has become a critical challenge for storage and processing systems. Efficient
data management is essential to ensure scalability, cost-effectiveness, and
timely analytics. To minimize storage expenses and optimize performance, data
compression algorithms are frequently utilized in data historians and
acquisition systems. However, compression comes with trade-offs that may
compromise the accuracy and reliability of engineering analytics that depend on
this compressed data. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for
developing data strategies that support both operational efficiency and
accurate, reliable analytics. This paper assesses the relation of common
compression mechanisms used in real-time and historical data systems and the
accuracy of analytical solutions, including statistical analysis, anomaly
detection, and machine learning models. Through theoretical analysis, simulated
signal compression, and empirical assessment, we illustrate that excessive
compression can lose critical patterns, skew statistical measures, and diminish
predictive accuracy. The study suggests optimum methods and best practices for
striking a compromise between analytical integrity and compression efficiency.

Conclusion: UDA - Bench可有效评估不同UDA系统，填补了相关领域基准缺失的空白。

Abstract: Nowadays, the explosion of unstructured data presents immense analytical
value. Leveraging the remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in
extracting attributes of structured tables from unstructured data, researchers
are developing LLM-powered data systems for users to analyze unstructured
documents as working with a database. These unstructured data analysis (UDA)
systems differ significantly in all aspects, including query interfaces, query
optimization strategies, and operator implementations, making it unclear which
performs best in which scenario. Unfortunately, there does not exist a
comprehensive benchmark that offers high-quality, large-volume, and diverse
datasets as well as rich query workload to thoroughly evaluate such systems. To
fill this gap, we present UDA-Bench, the first benchmark for unstructured data
analysis that meets all the above requirements. Specifically, we organize a
team with 30 graduate students that spends over in total 10,000 hours on
curating 5 datasets from various domains and constructing a relational database
view from these datasets by manual annotation. These relational databases can
be used as ground truth to evaluate any of these UDA systems despite their
differences in programming interfaces. Moreover, we design diverse queries to
analyze the attributes defined in the database schema, covering different types
of analytical operators with varying selectivities and complexities. We conduct
in-depth analysis of the key building blocks of existing UDA systems: query
interface, query optimization, operator design, and data processing. We run
exhaustive experiments over the benchmark to fully evaluate these systems and
different techniques w.r.t. the above building blocks.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架Compass实现向量和结构化数据的通用过滤搜索，性能优于NaviX，且与DBMS兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过滤搜索解决方案受专用索引限制，无法实现任意过滤和与通用DBMS集成，需要高效通用的查询支持。

Method: 利用现有索引结构，实现协调跨模态候选生成和谓词评估的合作查询执行策略。

Result: Compass在多种混合查询工作负载中始终优于NaviX，在单属性场景下与专用单属性索引的查询吞吐量相当。

Conclusion: Compass为向量数据库系统中的通用过滤搜索提供了实用且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates
efficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector
search with complex relational filtering. However, existing filtered search
solutions are fundamentally limited by specialized indices, which restrict
arbitrary filtering and hinder integration with general-purpose DBMSs. This
work introduces \textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general
filtered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index
designs. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF
for vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a
principled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate
generation and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass
maintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and
range predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or
multi-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Compass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general
framework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query
throughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings
with only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality
and DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution
for achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.

Result: 在18个数据集上，达到高预算基线性能的98.1%，减少24%评估次数，超现有强化学习方法3.6%。

Conclusion: ShapleyPipe性能提升，能提供可解释算子估值，利于管道分析和算子库优化。

Abstract: Automated data preparation pipeline construction is critical for machine
learning success, yet existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations:
they treat pipeline construction as black-box optimization without quantifying
individual operator contributions, and they struggle with the combinatorial
explosion of the search space ($N^M$ configurations for N operators and
pipeline length M). We introduce ShapleyPipe, a principled framework that
leverages game-theoretic Shapley values to systematically quantify each
operator's marginal contribution while maintaining full interpretability. Our
key innovation is a hierarchical decomposition that separates category-level
structure search from operator-level refinement, reducing the search complexity
from exponential to polynomial. To make Shapley computation tractable, we
develop: (1) a Multi-Armed Bandit mechanism for intelligent category evaluation
with provable convergence guarantees, and (2) Permutation Shapley values to
correctly capture position-dependent operator interactions. Extensive
evaluation on 18 diverse datasets demonstrates that ShapleyPipe achieves 98.1\%
of high-budget baseline performance while using 24\% fewer evaluations, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method by 3.6\%. Beyond
performance gains, ShapleyPipe provides interpretable operator valuations
($\rho$=0.933 correlation with empirical performance) that enable data-driven
pipeline analysis and systematic operator library refinement.

Conclusion: DRAMA能有效解决现有范式和系统的局限，可公开获取。

Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and
inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none
of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key
capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data
collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that
answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain
data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single
pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative
of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories
of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100
instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have
gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of
open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following
DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by
coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs
structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on
DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot
achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines
with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is

Motivation: 传统耦合存储方法在索引更新时效率低，解耦架构会降低查询性能。

Method: 提出解耦存储架构，设计三阶段查询机制和增量页面级拓扑重排序策略。

Result: 解耦架构插入更新速度提升10.05倍、删除提升6.89倍，三阶段查询和增量重排序使查询效率提升2.66倍。

Conclusion: 所提技术大幅减少ANN搜索的I/O和计算开销，提升效率。

Abstract: On-disk graph-based indexes are widely used in approximate nearest neighbor
(ANN) search systems for large-scale, high-dimensional vectors. However,
traditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are
inefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant
vector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to
significant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage
architecture. While a decoupled architecture reduces query performance. To
overcome this limitation, we design two tailored strategies: (i) a three-stage
query mechanism that leverages multiple PQ compressed vectors to filter invalid
I/O and computations, and (ii) an incremental page-level topological reordering
strategy that incrementally inserts new nodes into pages containing their most
similar neighbors to mitigate read amplification. Together, these techniques
substantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search.
Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed
by 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query
and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the
traditional coupled architecture.

Result: 在三个百万级基准数据集上评估，在中高多样性设置下，能以最小延迟开销一致检索到近最优多样化结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决现有问题，在多样化A$k$-NNS搜索中表现良好。

Abstract: Approximate $k$-nearest neighbor search (A$k$-NNS) is a core operation in
vector databases, underpinning applications such as retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and image retrieval. In these scenarios, users often prefer
diverse result sets to minimize redundancy and enhance information value.
However, existing greedy-based diverse methods frequently yield sub-optimal
results, failing to adequately approximate the optimal similarity score under
certain diversification level. Furthermore, there is a need for flexible
algorithms that can adapt to varying user-defined result sizes and diversity
requirements.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly
integrates result diversification into state-of-the-art (SOTA) A$k$-NNS
methods. Our approach introduces a progressive search framework, consisting of
iterative searching, diversification, and verification phases. Carefully
designed diversification and verification steps enable our approach to
efficiently approximate the optimal diverse result set according to
user-specified diversification levels without additional indexing overhead.
  We evaluate our method on three million-scale benchmark datasets, LAION-art,
Deep1M, and Txt2img, using latency, similarity, and recall as performance
metrics across a range of $k$ values and diversification thresholds.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently retrieves
near-optimal diverse results with minimal latency overhead, particularly under
medium and high diversity settings.

Motivation: AI部署从单体LLM作业转变为数据转换、微调等流水线，需新方案应对。

Method: 将工作流分解为细粒度算子，用全局控制平面管理，数据平面采用无状态工作节点弹性集群。

Result: 相比基线方案，实现最高3.8倍成本降低、2.0倍能耗降低，延迟表现相似或更好，动态和故障条件下仍高效。

Conclusion: FlowMesh能有效执行和优化AI部署工作负载，有成本、能耗和性能优势。

Abstract: AI deployment increasingly resembles a pipeline of data transformation,
fine-tuning, and agent interactions rather than a monolithic LLM job; recent
examples include RLHF/RLAIF training and agentic workflows. To cope with this
shift, we propose FlowMesh, a multi-tenant service fabric that executes and
optimizes these workloads as one shared service instead of isolated pipelines.
It decomposes workflows into fine-grained operators with recorded lineage,
enabling de-duplication of work across users and batching requests on the same
hardware while preserving per-workflow provenance. A global control plane
maintains a cluster-wide pool of ready operators and uses a single utility
function to pick both the batch and the worker, balancing throughput, cost, and
data locality on heterogeneous GPUs. The data plane is an elastic fleet of
stateless workers backed by a content-addressable store, enabling rapid,
automatic scale-out, safe retry after preemption, and portability across
managed clusters such as Kubernetes and geo-distributed GPU marketplaces such
as Vast.ai. Compared with baseline solutions, FlowMesh achieves up to 3.8x cost
reduction and 2.0x lower energy usage, provides a similar or better latency
profile, and remains efficient under dynamic and failure-prone conditions.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of
intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic
signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional
models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies
in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external
factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates
Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture
for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in
modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers'
ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual
features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy.
The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve
scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset
shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure
Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings
suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and
scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological
advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for
congestion mitigation.

TL;DR: 本文提出新的张量与流水线并行调度方法，减少两种气泡，提升大语言模型和多模态大语言模型训练吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量并行（TP）有通信开销，流水线并行（PP）有同步低效问题，且现有工作孤立解决，本文希望同时减少两种气泡。

Method: 将PP的前向和反向传播解耦为细粒度计算单元，编织成复合计算序列以消除TP相关气泡，在此基础上设计PP调度以减少PP气泡。

Result: 实验表明，相比现有调度方法，该方法使大语言模型训练吞吐量最高提升12%，多模态大语言模型提升16%。

Conclusion: 提出的协同张量与流水线并行调度方法有效，能提升训练效率，代码开源。

Abstract: In the machine learning system, the hybrid model parallelism combining tensor
parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) has become the dominant solution
for distributed training of Large Language Models~(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs). However, TP introduces significant collective communication overheads,
while PP suffers from synchronization inefficiencies such as pipeline bubbles.
Existing works primarily address these challenges from isolated perspectives,
focusing either on overlapping TP communication or on flexible PP scheduling to
mitigate pipeline bubbles. In this paper, we propose a new synergistic tensor
and pipeline parallelism schedule that simultaneously reduces both types of
bubbles. Our proposed schedule decouples the forward and backward passes in PP
into fine-grained computation units, which are then braided to form a composite
computation sequence. This compositional structure enables near-complete
elimination of TP-related bubbles. Building upon this structure, we further
design the PP schedule to minimize PP bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16%
for MLLMs compared to existing scheduling methods. Our source code is avaiable

Motivation: 大规模去中心化系统协调是挑战，协作数字孪生虽可解决隐私问题，但从其共享信息中推导全局最优控制策略仍是难题。

Method: 提出DT - MADDPG算法，一种将多智能体强化学习框架与协作数字孪生网络集成的混合架构，采用模拟辅助学习算法，用协作构建的预测全局模型增强集中式评论家。

Abstract: The coordination of large-scale, decentralised systems, such as a fleet of
Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, presents a
significant challenge for modern control systems. While collaborative Digital
Twins have been proposed as a solution to manage such systems without
compromising the privacy of individual agents, deriving globally optimal
control policies from the high-level information they share remains an open
problem. This paper introduces Digital Twin Assisted Multi-Agent Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm, a novel hybrid
architecture that integrates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
with a collaborative DT network. Our core contribution is a simulation-assisted
learning algorithm where the centralised critic is enhanced by a predictive
global model that is collaboratively built from the privacy-preserving data
shared by individual DTs. This approach removes the need for collecting
sensitive raw data at a centralised entity, a requirement of traditional
multi-agent learning algorithms. Experimental results in a simulated V2G
environment demonstrate that DT-MADDPG can achieve coordination performance
comparable to the standard MADDPG algorithm while offering significant
advantages in terms of data privacy and architectural decentralisation. This
work presents a practical and robust framework for deploying intelligent,
learning-based coordination in complex, real-world cyber-physical systems.

Method: 提出在线策略，动态调度有依赖的计算任务，通过实时决策服务器频率缩放和服务模块迁移来控制能耗。

Result: 使用真实数据集实验表明算法能有效利用收集的能量并保持低服务延迟。

Conclusion: 所提在线策略可解决纯能量收集供电的MEC系统资源分配问题，实现高效能量利用和低延迟服务。

Abstract: Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) delivers low-latency services by hosting
applications near end-users. To promote sustainability, these systems are
increasingly integrated with renewable Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies,
enabling operation where grid electricity is unavailable. However, balancing
the intermittent nature of harvested energy with dynamic user demand presents a
significant resource allocation challenge. This work proposes an online
strategy for an MEC system powered exclusively by EH to address this trade-off.
Our strategy dynamically schedules computational tasks with dependencies and
governs energy consumption through real-time decisions on server frequency
scaling and service module migration. Experiments using real-world datasets
demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in efficiently utilizing harvested
energy while maintaining low service latency.

Result: 算法结果可接受，将启发式方法扩展到递归并行分区算法，构建预测特定规模线性代数方程组递归步数的kNN模型。

Conclusion: 提出的算法可行，可用于确定并行分区算法和递归并行分区算法的最优子系统大小及递归步数。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning (ML)-based heuristic for finding the
optimum sub-system size for the CUDA implementation of the parallel partition
algorithm. Computational experiments for different system of linear algebraic
equation (SLAE) sizes are conducted, and the optimum sub-system size for each
of them is found empirically. To estimate a model for the sub-system size, we
perform the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification method. Statistical
analysis of the results is done. By comparing the predicted values with the
actual data, the algorithm is deemed to be acceptably good. Next, the heuristic
is expanded to work for the recursive parallel partition algorithm as well. An
algorithm for determining the optimum sub-system size for each recursive step
is formulated. A kNN model for predicting the optimum number of recursive steps
for a particular SLAE size is built.

Motivation: 现有实现锁定特定NIC，阻碍集成到推理引擎和跨硬件供应商的可移植性。

Method: TransferEngine桥接常见NIC功能，提供统一接口，支持单边WriteImm操作和ImmCounter原语，透明管理每个GPU的多个NIC。

Result: 在NVIDIA ConnectX - 7和AWS EFA上实现400 Gbps峰值吞吐量，在三个生产系统中展示优势。

Conclusion: 便携式点对点通信能补充集体通信，避免锁定。

Abstract: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) system patterns, such as disaggregated
inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, and asynchronous reinforcement
fine-tuning, require flexible point-to-point communication beyond simple
collectives. Existing implementations are locked to specific Network Interface
Controllers (NICs), hindering integration into inference engines and
portability across hardware providers. We present TransferEngine, which bridges
the functionality of common NICs to expose a uniform interface. TransferEngine
exposes one-sided WriteImm operations with a ImmCounter primitive for
completion notification, without ordering assumptions of network transport,
transparently managing multiple NICs per GPU. We demonstrate peak throughput of
400 Gbps on both NVIDIA ConnectX-7 and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). We
showcase TransferEngine through three production systems: (1) KvCache transfer
for disaggregated inference with dynamic scaling, (2) RL weight updates
achieving 1.3 seconds for trillion-parameter models, and (3) MoE
dispatch/combine implementation exceeding DeepEP decode latency on ConnectX-7,
with the first viable latencies on EFA. We demonstrate that our portable
point-to-point communication complements collectives while avoiding lock-in.

Result: 当F为循环图或线性森林时，F - 顶点分裂问题在两种变体下多项式时间可解；当F为星座图或二分图时，问题在两种变体下为NP完全问题。

Conclusion: 不同目标图类下F - 顶点分裂问题的复杂度不同。

Abstract: We study a family of graph modification problems called the F-Vertex
Splitting problem. Given a graph G, the task is to determine whether G can be
transformed into a graph G-prime belonging to a graph class F through a
sequence of at most k vertex splits. We investigate this problem for several
target graph classes, namely constellations, cycle graphs, linear forests, and
bipartite graphs. We analyze both inclusive and exclusive variants of vertex
splitting, as introduced by Abu-Khzam and collaborators (ISCO 2018). Our
results show that the F-Vertex Splitting problem is polynomial-time solvable
when F is a cycle graph or a linear forest, for both variants. In contrast,
when F is a constellation or a bipartite graph, the problem is NP-complete for
both variants.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The online bin packing problem and its variants are regularly used to model
server allocation problems. Modern concerns surrounding sustainability and
overcommitment in cloud computing motivate bin packing models that capture
costs associated with highly utilized servers. In this work, we introduce the
green bin packing problem, an online variant with a linear cost $\beta$ for
filling above a fixed level $G$. For a given instance, the goal is to minimize
the sum of the number of opened bins and the linear cost. We show that when
$\beta G \le 1$, classical online bin packing algorithms such as FirstFit or
Harmonic perform well, and can achieve competitive ratios lower than in the
classic setting. However, when $\beta G > 1$, new algorithmic solutions can
improve both worst-case and typical performance. We introduce variants of
classic online bin packing algorithms and establish theoretical bounds, as well
as test their empirical performance.

Motivation: 寻找高效将Gomory - Hu树问题归约到最大流计算的方法。

Method: 提出简单有效的随机归约方法。

Result: 在无权图上归约到总实例大小为$	ilde{O}(m)$的图的最大流计算，需$	ilde{O}(m)$额外时间；在有权图上实例大小和运行时间增至$	ilde{O}(n^2)$；可扩展到无权超图。

Conclusion: 该归约是首个在多对数因子下紧的归约。

Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a Gomory-Hu tree $T$ (Gomory and Hu,
1961) is a tree on $V$ that preserves all-pairs mincuts of $G$ exactly.
  We present a simple and efficient randomized reduction from Gomory-Hu trees
to polylog maxflow computations. On unweighted graphs, our reduction reduces to
maxflow computations on graphs of total instance size $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the
algorithm requires only $\tilde{O}(m)$ additional time. Our reduction is the
first that is tight up to polylog factors. The reduction also seamlessly
extends to weighted graphs, however, instance sizes and runtime increase to
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$.
  Finally, we show how to extend our reduction to reduce Gomory-Hu trees for
unweighted hypergraphs to maxflow in hypergraphs. Again, our reduction is the
first that is tight up to polylog factors.

Motivation: 现有静态函数数据结构虽比哈希表省内存，但压缩静态函数接近值序列的零阶经验熵，希望突破该限制。

Method: 使用机器学习捕捉键和值之间的相关性，为每个键预测值的概率分布，推导特定键的前缀码来紧凑编码真实值，将结果码字存储在经典静态函数数据结构中。

Result: 实验显示在真实数据上节省高达一个数量级的空间，在合成数据上节省高达三个数量级的空间。

Conclusion: 学习型静态函数能突破零阶熵障碍，同时支持点查询，有显著空间节省效果。

Abstract: We consider the task of constructing a data structure for associating a
static set of keys with values, while allowing arbitrary output values for
queries involving keys outside the set. Compared to hash tables, these
so-called static function data structures do not need to store the key set and
thus use significantly less memory. Several techniques are known, with
compressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the
value sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use
machine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key,
a model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we
derive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The
resulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This
design allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier
while still supporting point queries. Our experiments show substantial space
savings: up to one order of magnitude on real data, and up to three orders of
magnitude on synthetic data.

TL;DR: 提出 Rateless Bloom Filter (RBF) 用于集合调和协议，可适应可变大小元素和大量差异情况，在 Jaccard 指数低于 85% 时降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合调和协议针对固定大小元素且差异基数小的情况设计，处理可变大小元素和大量差异时效率低。

Method: 提出两阶段混合协议，引入初步 Bloom 过滤器步骤，设计 Rateless Bloom Filter (RBF) 动态过滤器。

Result: 在可变大小元素集合评估中，对于 Jaccard 指数低于 85%，RBF - IBLT 混合协议相比现有技术最多降低超 20% 通信成本。

Conclusion: RBF 能自然适应任意对称差异，无需预先参数化，有效降低通信成本。

Abstract: Set reconciliation protocols typically make two critical assumptions: they
are designed for fixed-sized elements and they are optimized for when the
difference cardinality, d, is very small. When adapting to variable-sized
elements, the current practice is to synchronize fixed-size element digests.
However, when the number of differences is considerable, such as after a
network partition, this approach can be inefficient. Our solution is a
two-stage hybrid protocol that introduces a preliminary Bloom filter step,
specifically designed for this regime. The novelty of this approach, however,
is in solving a core technical challenge: determining the optimal Bloom filter
size without knowing d. Our solution is the Rateless Bloom Filter (RBF), a
dynamic filter that naturally adapts to arbitrary symmetric differences,
closely matching the communication complexity of an optimally configured static
filter without requiring any prior parametrization. Our evaluation in sets of
variable-sized elements shows that for Jaccard indices below 85%, our RBF-IBLT
hybrid protocol reduces the total communication cost by up to over 20% compared
to the state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在供需长期失衡的分配危机中，稀缺资源向富人集中，全面集中分配不可行，购买权是更可行的监管方式。

Method: 将购买权嵌入（重复）Arrow - Debreu模型，模拟监管者定期分配购买权以促进公平分配。

Result: 定义了迭代市场，给出市场出清价格的近似算法，得出挫折感的上限。

Conclusion: 通过购买权进行监管能在一定程度上解决资源分配不平等问题。

Abstract: We embed buying rights into a (repeated) Arrow-Debreu model to study the
long-term effects of regulation through buying rights on arising inequality.
Our motivation stems from situations that typically call for regulatory
interventions, such as rationing, namely, distribution crises in which demand
and supply are persistently misaligned. In such settings, scarce resources tend
to become increasingly concentrated among more affluent individuals, while the
needs of the broader population remain unmet. While fully centralized
distribution may be logistically or politically unfeasible, issuing buying
rights offers a more practical alternative: they can be implemented digitally,
e.g., via tokens traded on online platforms, making them significantly easier
to administer. We model a scenario in which a regulator periodically
distributes buying rights with the aim of promoting a more equitable
allocation. Our contributions include (i) the definition of the (iterated)
market where in each round the buying rights are distributed and then traded
alongside the resource, (ii) the approximation algorithm of the market-clearing
prices in every round, and (iii) the upper bound on \textit{frustration} -- a
notion conceptually similar to the Price of Anarchy, but for systems regulated
through buying rights, defined as the arising loss in fairness the individual
buyers have to take when the distribution is handled via the market.

Abstract: Predatory pricing -- where a firm strategically lowers prices to undermine
competitors -- is a contentious topic in dynamic oligopoly theory, with
scholars debating practical relevance and the existence of predatory
equilibria. Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to
capture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence
and form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit
(drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We
focus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces
the subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium
can be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not
in models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in
finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key
findings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms
reliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information
oligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the
resulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results
demonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium
strategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium
analysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study
answers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition
authorities and regulators.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space,
agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however,
retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations
shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such
biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from
prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text
retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images
culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in
text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more
effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias
remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that
achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies
beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may
be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic
prevalence.

Abstract: Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern
information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover
items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems
address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past
decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from
collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to
neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of
generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which
reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative
scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified
tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than
simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into
operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and
training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models
enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying
heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods,
large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their
alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new
capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and
personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world
knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities,
scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in
benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a
roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape
human-information interaction.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of textual content on the Internet, efficient
large-scale semantic text retrieval has garnered increasing attention from both
academia and industry. Text hashing, which projects original texts into compact
binary hash codes, is a crucial method for this task. By using binary codes,
the semantic similarity computation for text pairs is significantly accelerated
via fast Hamming distance calculations, and storage costs are greatly reduced.
With the advancement of deep learning, deep text hashing has demonstrated
significant advantages over traditional, data-independent hashing techniques.
By leveraging deep neural networks, these methods can learn compact and
semantically rich binary representations directly from data, overcoming the
performance limitations of earlier approaches. This survey investigates current
deep text hashing methods by categorizing them based on their core components:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习药物推荐方法无法提供推荐推导过程的见解，这在高风险应用中是关键缺陷。

Method: 提出基于医学知识图谱（MKG）的TraceDR系统，在多任务学习框架下同时预测药物推荐和相关证据；设计自动构建患者健康记录的框架并发布新测试平台DrugRec。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in
selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions.
State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR,
but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of
recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We
propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph
(MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information.
TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence
within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication
recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than
existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient
health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.

Motivation: 解决协同过滤推荐系统中冷启动用户因无历史数据难以提供个性化推荐的问题。

Result: 实验表明两个改进都提升了性能，尤其在减少查询数量时。

Conclusion: 提出的扩展方法有效，能改善音乐推荐中评分引出的性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest
items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their
interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on
users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is
new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical
data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To
address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial
ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early
understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally
categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision
tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about
their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is
gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach
for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i)
elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres
to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at
each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results
demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance,
particularly with a reduced number of queries.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Interact - RAG范式，使LLM代理从被动查询者变为主动操控者，实验证明其性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理RAG方法将检索过程视为黑盒查询操作，限制了代理处理复杂信息搜索任务的能力。

Method: 引入Corpus Interaction Engine拆解黑盒，开发推理增强工作流，用监督微调训练端到端代理，再用强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，Interact - RAG显著优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 推理 - 交互策略有效。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by
incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches
are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a
black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing,
hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address
this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent
from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval
process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping
the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over
information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline,
we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot
execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this
synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG
significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of
our reasoning-interaction strategy.

TL;DR: 研究持续预训练大语言模型受虚假信息影响，引入框架量化事实信念变化，发现易内化错误信息，需监控事实完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续预训练使大语言模型接触错误信息，前人未探究持续预训练中数据投毒影响，受人类认知中虚幻真实效应启发，研究模型是否有类似弱点。

Method: 引入Layer of Truth框架和数据集，注入受控投毒数据，在不同检查点、模型规模和问题类型下探测中间表征。

Result: 即使少量接触虚假信息，也会使既定事实的表征产生持续偏移，不同层和模型大小的易感性不同。

Conclusion: 持续更新的大语言模型存在易内化错误信息的漏洞，需在模型更新时对事实完整性进行有力监控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

Abstract: We present MLPerf Automotive, the first standardized public benchmark for
evaluating Machine Learning systems that are deployed for AI acceleration in
automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in
automotive machine learning systems. Existing benchmark suites cannot be
utilized for these systems since automotive workloads have unique constraints
including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object
detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the
methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference
models, and submission rules. We also discuss the first round of benchmark
submissions and the challenges involved in acquiring the datasets and the
engineering efforts to develop the reference implementations. Our benchmark

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型易受对抗操纵，影响部署的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 先在HuggingFace生态中生成对抗图像，再提出SmoothGuard框架，通过随机噪声注入和基于聚类的预测聚合增强模型鲁棒性，对连续模态添加高斯噪声、生成候选输出、聚类过滤预测结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试上实验表明SmoothGuard提高了模型对对抗攻击的恢复能力，同时保持了竞争力；消融实验确定了0.1 - 0.2的最佳噪声范围。

Conclusion: SmoothGuard能增强多模态大语言模型的鲁棒性，且可平衡鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

Method: 将多目标优化转化为零和博弈，提出FedPF算法。

Result: 实验在三个数据集上减少达42.9%的歧视，保持有竞争力的准确率，揭示隐私与公平的矛盾不可避免。

Conclusion: 同时实现隐私和公平需平衡妥协，而非孤立优化。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

<details>

Motivation: 传统家庭用水监测方法成本高、耗时长，研究能否利用公开图像和简单地理空间协变量预测家庭用水。

Method: 比较四种方法，包括调查特征（基准）、CNN嵌入（卫星、GSV、组合）和带辅助数据的GSV语义地图，在序数分类框架下进行分析。

Result: GSV分割加遥感协变量预测用水准确率达0.55，接近调查模型的0.59，极端用水情况精度高，中间类别因视觉代理重叠有混淆。

Conclusion: 公开图像结合少量地理空间数据为城市分析中通过调查获取可靠家庭用水估计提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有即席自推测方法速度增益有限，级联层次草稿模型训练成本高，传统级联算法用于自推测解码效率低。

Method: 提出CAS - Spec方法，利用DSIA策略构建推测草稿模型；引入DyTC算法，根据接受率和延迟预测启发式自适应路由多级草稿模型和分配草稿长度。

Result: CAS - Spec相比现有即席推测解码方法实现了最先进的加速，在不同大语言模型和数据集上比自回归解码平均加速1.1 - 2.3倍；DyTC比基于级联和基于树的基线算法平均加速分别提高47%和48%。

Conclusion: CAS - Spec可轻松集成到大多数现有大语言模型中，随着自推测解码技术发展有进一步加速潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

Motivation: GAN存在模式崩溃问题，而实际应用需要生成模型具备多样性和不确定性感知能力。

Method: 引入BI - DCGAN，集成Bayes by Backprop学习网络权重分布，用平均场变分推断近似后验分布，基于协方差矩阵分析给出理论证明。

Result: 通过标准生成基准实验，表明BI - DCGAN比传统DCGAN输出更多样、更稳健，且保持训练效率。

Conclusion: BI - DCGAN是适用于对多样性和不确定性要求高、资源有限场景的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

Result: 在多个DBMS和工作负载上实验，RelTune比传统基于BO的方法收敛更快、优化效率更高。

Conclusion: RelTune在所有评估场景中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多应用中需要实用且一致的算法相似性度量，而现有问题是该问题通用情况下不可计算且存在竞争的相似性概念。

Method: 回顾现有等价和相似性概念，引入 EMOC 框架，编译 PACD 数据集。

Result: EMOC 特征支持算法类型的聚类和分类、近重复检测以及大语言模型生成程序多样性量化。

Conclusion: 发布计算 EMOC 嵌入的代码、数据和实用工具，便于可重复性研究和未来算法相似性工作。

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

<details>

Motivation: 原图灵测试已不能满足需求，先进AI系统通过测试带来伦理和环境问题，需更新测试。

Method: 在原模仿游戏基础上，加入回答问题所消耗能量这一因素。

Result: 新测试使我们从效率角度评估智能，将思维问题与有限资源联系起来，且有可衡量的实际终点。

Conclusion: 新测试的额外约束促使社会权衡使用AI节省的时间和其资源总成本。

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

TL;DR: 提出SERFLOW方法，通过利用FaaS和阶段特定资源配置，降低云成本超23%并适应动态工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有机器学习模型分区动态卸载工作忽略虚拟机冷启动、长尾服务时间分布等现实因素的问题。

Method: 将每个ML查询建模为遍历一个无环阶段序列，利用FaaS的无服务器函数和阶段特定资源配置，并与自适应负载均衡集成。

Result: SERFLOW降低云成本超23%，能有效适应动态工作负载。

Conclusion: SERFLOW可在降低成本的同时高效适应动态工作负载，解决了现有工作的局限。

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

Motivation: 解决有限计算下如何在固定计算预算内最大化迭代对抗攻击强度的问题。

Method: 提出细粒度控制机制，在迭代和层两个层面选择性重新计算层激活。

Result: 在同等成本下，方法始终优于现有基线；集成到对抗训练中，用30%原始预算达到相近性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在有限计算预算下有效提升迭代对抗攻击的强度。

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

Motivation: 前人工作未明确Transformer实现长度泛化所需的训练序列长度，本文旨在给出定量界限。

Method: 在多种问题设置下分析长度泛化，证明当长序列内部行为可由训练时短序列行为“模拟”时会发生泛化。

Result: 得到Transformer泛化所需训练数据长度的定性估计，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 深化了对Transformer外推机制的理论理解，明确复杂任务泛化需要更丰富训练数据。

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于评论的推荐系统在利用大语言模型进行信息提取时存在挖掘无范围控制、缺乏关联幻觉与下游效果的指标、未充分探索成本 - 质量权衡等问题。

Method: 提出两阶段的HADSF框架，先通过自适应选择生成紧凑的语料级方面词汇表，再进行词汇引导的结构化方面 - 观点三元组提取；引入Aspect Drift Rate (ADR)和Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR)评估表征保真度。

Result: 在约300万条评论、参数范围15亿 - 70亿的大语言模型上实验，HADSF集成到标准评分预测器中可持续降低预测误差，小模型在代表性部署场景中也能有竞争力表现。

Conclusion: HADSF能有效解决现有问题，相关代码、数据管道和指标实现的开源可支持可复现研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

Motivation: 探究为何某些学习规则表现更好，以及在何种假设下特定规则是最优的。

Method: 提出理论框架，将学习规则视为导航损失景观的策略，把最优规则视为最优控制问题的解。

Result: 在不同假设下，多种知名学习规则自然出现，还表明持续学习策略可视为对任务不确定性的最优响应。

Conclusion: 框架阐明了学习的计算结构，为设计自适应算法提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

Motivation: 现有优化器到达局部最小值后停止搜索，难以保证找到最低或泛化性最好的点，需要改进。

Method: 提出适配器“E”，使优化器在到达局部最小值后沿损失谷继续探索，还给出凸和非凸场景下的收敛证明。

Result: 在大批次训练中，适配后的Lamb（ALTO）使当前最优优化器的测试准确率平均提高2.5%。

Conclusion: 该工作为优化算法设计潜在开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化条件和可复制性，评估和比较MAB算法具有挑战性，尤其是方差感知扩展算法，因此要解决如何可靠观察算法性能差异及方差感知算法何时优于经典算法的问题。

Method: 提出可复现的评估框架，在Bandit Playground代码库中实现，有明确定义的实验设置、多个性能指标和交互式评估界面。

Result: 方差感知算法在高不确定性场景有优势，经典算法在可分离场景或经过大量微调后表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 贡献一是提出MAB算法系统评估框架，二是明确方差感知方法优于经典方法的条件。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

Motivation: 现有联合学习不变和等变表示的方法使用单独投影头，忽略两者间共享信息，导致特征学习冗余和模型容量利用低效。

Method: 引入STAR路由策略，将投影头建模为专家，使专家专门捕捉共享或特定任务信息。

Result: 观察到不变和等变嵌入之间的典型相关性降低，在多种迁移学习任务中取得一致改进。

Conclusion: STAR策略能减少冗余特征学习，提升模型在迁移学习任务中的表现。

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

Motivation: 大语言模型的事实性和拒绝训练易受提示简单更改的影响，存在盲从和越狱问题。

Method: 提出一致性训练范式，通过Bias - augmented Consistency Training (BCT) 和新方法Activation Consistency Training (ACT) 两种方式实施。

Result: 两种方法都降低了Gemini 2.5 Flash对无关线索的敏感性，BCT和ACT减少盲从效果相当，BCT防越狱效果更好。

Conclusion: BCT可简化训练流程，部分对齐问题应视为一致性问题。

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

Conclusion: 为无严格任务结构和统一传感器放置的颅内神经数据大规模跨主体聚合和预训练指明方向。

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出量子跳跃的量子启发神经网络QiNN - QJ用于多模态纠缠建模，在基准数据集上表现优且有更好解释性，为多模态融合提供框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子启发融合模型依赖单一变换，存在训练不稳定和泛化性有限问题，需新模型解决。

Method: 将各模态编码为量子纯态，用可微模块模拟QJ算子将可分积态转换为纠缠表示，联合学习哈密顿和林德布拉德算子产生可控跨模态纠缠，投影纠缠态进行预测。

Result: 在CMU - MOSI、CMU - MOSEI和CH - SIMS等基准数据集上性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 建立了纠缠多模态融合的原则框架，为量子启发方法建模复杂跨模态关联铺平道路。

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Conclusion: 该方法有效，有生物学意义和潜在临床应用，可结合空间转录组学进一步研究。

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在离线上下文多臂老虎机中能有效解决公平性问题，减少群体间的奖励差异。

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in
drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic
AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out
experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed
loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI
architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm
systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery,
including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol
generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end
decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work
to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI
systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations
demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability,
compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining
scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data
heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline
future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.

Result: 基于文章评分总体QWK更高；基于理由评分在分数为0时F1得分更高；文章评分模型集成提升准确性；文章评分与单个理由评分集成效果相近；文章评分与两个理由评分集成效果最佳，QWK达0.870。

Conclusion: 文章评分总体表现好，特定情况理由评分有优势，合适的集成建模可提高自动评分准确性。

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

TL;DR: 文章提出FairAD用于图聚类公平性问题，实验显示其比现有算法快达40倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型对特定群体的不良行为引发关注，现有图聚类算法融入公平性约束计算困难。

Method: 先基于代数距离构建新的亲和矩阵以施加公平性约束，再对亲和矩阵进行图粗化找到代表节点，最后求解约束最小化问题。

Result: 在修改的随机块模型和六个公共数据集上的实验表明，FairAD能实现公平聚类，且比现有算法快达40倍。

Conclusion: FairAD是一种计算高效的公平图聚类方法。

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型微调即服务的有害微调防御策略存在难以应对未知攻击和适应性有限的问题。

Method: 将有害微调防御表述为贝叶斯推理问题，根据微调与对齐数据集学习数据点安全属性的后验分布，用安全属性加权数据来约束微调过程，还引入基于摊销贝叶斯学习的神经调度器。

Result: 在不同攻击和防御设置中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的BDS策略有效，无需攻击模拟，能实现自适应防御，且代码开源。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

Result: 在兼容性条件下显著改进了先前的遗憾界，将算法扩展到有额外观测的情况时也改进了先前的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 新算法在更弱的假设下表现更好，为在线稀疏线性回归问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

Conclusion: 该框架为土木工程师和城市规划者提供先进预测能力，可用于交通基础设施设计和城市发展项目的决策。

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

Method: 引入Feature - Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA)框架分析模型学习函数几何，生成特征四维签名，并扩展到动态原型分析追踪训练过程中签名演变。

Result: 提供分层学习的直接经验证据，动态分析可诊断模型容量不足和预测过拟合，实验表明FFCA能为模型解释提供必要几何背景。

Conclusion: FFCA的静态和动态组件能将模型解释从简单量化转变为对整个学习过程细致、可信的分析。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

Result: 在不同不平衡程度的长尾数据集上实验，FedSM在准确率上始终优于现有方法，对域偏移有高鲁棒性且计算高效。

Conclusion: FedSM能有效缓解联邦学习中的偏差问题，具有良好性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

Method: 提出IWD框架，利用影响函数在蒸馏过程中考虑数据质量，为每个实例分配自适应权重，且可集成到不同数据集蒸馏框架。

Result: 集成IWD能提升蒸馏数据集质量和模型性能，精度最高提升7.8%。

Conclusion: IWD框架有效，能在数据集蒸馏中考虑数据质量，提高模型表现。

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

Result: 超80%的查询被成功路由到小模型，解题概率下降不到10%。

Conclusion: 所提出的ECVL - ROUTER框架能有效根据用户需求选择模型，平衡延迟、能耗和输出质量。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

Conclusion: HLA是一个有原则、可扩展的构建块，结合了类似注意力的数据依赖混合和现代循环架构的效率。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

Conclusion: HiF - DTA能有效预测药物 - 靶点亲和力，全局 - 局部特征提取和多尺度融合策略有重要作用。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Abstract: Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making
among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise
systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient
information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth.
However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the
inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across
multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present
EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings,
featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and
administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise
characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control
hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel
data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks
from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents
demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task
completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in
enterprise-focused AI systems.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Method: 将物联网流量异常检测作为二分类问题，对比批学习和流学习方法，模拟异构网络数据流，评估当前数据集局限性，比较基于树和非基于树的机器学习算法。

Result: 批模型无法处理概念漂移，当前数据集因流量异质性低难以暴露模型局限；基于树的算法有优势，Adaptive Random Forest和Hoeffding Adaptive Tree在降低计算成本的同时取得较好F1分数。

Conclusion: 流学习在物联网流量异常检测中更具优势，基于树的算法如Adaptive Random Forest和Hoeffding Adaptive Tree可在降低计算成本下实现较好检测效果，Hoeffding Adaptive Tree适合在线应用。

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型输出与预训练语料库的关系，研究模型行为，现有TDA方法聚焦训练示例对输出的因果影响，本文关注哪些输出无法归因于预训练示例。

Method: 引入不可归因性作为语义新颖性的操作度量，采用两阶段检索管道：用轻量级GIST嵌入对语料库索引，检索前n个候选，再用ColBERTv2重新排序，若最近语料项的可归因性低于人类生成文本参考，则认为模型输出是新颖的。

Result: 在SmolLM和SmolLM2上评估有三项发现：模型利用预训练数据的跨度比以前报道的更长；某些领域会系统地促进或抑制新颖性；指令调优不仅改变风格，还增加新颖性。

Conclusion: 以不可归因性重构新颖性评估能实现预训练规模的高效分析，发布数据支持复现和大规模扩展分析。

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

Motivation: 医疗数据的多模态和异构时间结构给建模带来挑战，需要有效方法应对。

Method: 提出MedM2T框架，包括稀疏时间序列编码器、分层时间感知融合和双模态注意力机制，使用特定预训练编码器并在共享编码器中对齐特征。

Conclusion: MedM2T具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性，是临床预测的有前景工具。

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

Motivation: 监测基于结果的强化学习训练的CoT模型的思维链，需保证其可读性和忠实性，以此为目标开展研究。

Method: 对14个推理模型的CoT可读性进行研究，通过强制使用易读部分、重采样等方式分析。

Result: 强化学习常使推理对人类和AI监测器难以理解；模型用难读推理得出正确答案，重采样时可读性与性能无关联；难题上可读性下降。

Conclusion: 若不明确优化可读性，基于结果的强化学习自然产生推理过程不透明的模型，可能破坏监测方法。

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

Motivation: 思维链的可解释性有助于发现模型不安全或未对齐行为，但完全衡量其忠实性困难，现有代理方法有信息损失，需更全面评估。

Method: 引入详尽性概念，结合忠实性得出可监控性分数，在BBH、GPQA和MMLU上评估指令调优和推理模型。

Result: 模型可能看似忠实但因遗漏关键因素而难以监控，不同模型家族的可监控性差异显著。

Conclusion: 思维链的可监控性评估需综合考虑忠实性和详尽性，评估代码开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法使用逐元素局部优化器，忽略权重矩阵几何结构，导致病态方向放大、条件数恶化和收敛缓慢，需要更有效的优化器来减少通信轮次。

Method: 先引入Local Muon优化器，针对非IID设置挑战提出Federated Muon（FedMuon）优化器，包含动量聚合和局部 - 全局对齐技术。

Result: 在IID设置下，Local Muon加速收敛、减少通信轮次；FedMuon理论上实现线性加速收敛率，实证上减少通信轮次、提高测试准确率。

Conclusion: FedMuon优化器在联邦学习中有效，能显著减少通信轮次并提高测试精度。

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment可分摊可解释AI和机械可解释性成本，以低成本使新模型透明可控。

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Conclusion: 谱保留网络在图表示学习中有明显优势。

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

Motivation: 多数对推理模型的研究仅关注单条思维链，作者认为这不足以理解因果影响和潜在计算，需研究模型定义的多条思维链分布。

Method: 通过重采样开展案例研究，包括测量特定句子下游影响、对比不同干预方式、引入弹性指标、采用因果中介分析等。

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model

TL;DR: 本文提出FedAdamW算法用于联邦学习训练和微调大模型，理论证明收敛率，实证验证其有效性，能减少通信轮数和提高测试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接在联邦学习中应用AdamW存在二阶矩估计方差高、局部过拟合导致客户端漂移和收敛慢等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出FedAdamW算法，使用局部校正机制和去耦权重衰减，聚合二阶矩估计的均值并重新初始化。

Result: 理论上证明FedAdamW在无异质性假设下的线性加速收敛率，实证验证在语言和视觉Transformer模型上能显著减少通信轮数和提高测试准确率。

Conclusion: FedAdamW算法有效解决了在联邦学习中应用AdamW的问题，可用于大模型训练和微调。

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

TL;DR: 提出InertialAR模型解决3D分子生成难题，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自回归模型在3D分子生成应用不足，存在分子标记和架构设计两大挑战。

Method: 设计规范标记法确保不变性，用GeoRoPE使注意力机制有几何感知，用分层自回归范式预测原子标记。

Result: 在无条件分子生成7/10评估指标和可控生成所有5个指标上达最优。

Conclusion: InertialAR能有效解决3D分子生成问题，性能出色。

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all
5 metrics.

Conclusion: DP - FedPGN能缓解DP导致的性能下降，消除数据异质性影响，实现快速收敛。

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统预条件子难以利用数据优化，现有基于学习的方法依赖不完全分解，存在GPU并行化困难和长距离依赖难建模的问题。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效生成GPU友好的预条件子，提升求解性能。

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

Conclusion: 通用时间序列基础模型能有效迁移到EEG，跨领域预训练模型用于脑信号分析有前景，EEG可从时间序列文献进展中受益。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

Motivation: 训练SHM系统的数据获取成本高且困难，不同结构数据分布不同，传统方法泛化误差大，以往方法多为无监督DA且未考虑在线框架。

Method: 提出贝叶斯框架，利用少量有标签目标数据改进无监督DA映射，集成主动采样策略选择最具信息的观测进行标注。

Result: 在实验桥梁数据上验证，结合迁移学习和主动学习能在标签稀缺场景下提高数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可减少结构运营期间的检查次数，降低运营成本。

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

Motivation: 大语言模型训练成本高，低精度全量化训练有需求，但4位格式实现近无损训练有挑战。

Method: 引入TetraJet - v2，采用NVFP4用于所有线性层的激活、权重和梯度；提出无偏双块量化方法、OsciReset算法抑制权重振荡、OutControl算法保留异常值精度。

Result: TetraJet - v2在不同模型大小（最大370M）和数据大小（最大200B tokens）的预训练大语言模型上始终优于先前FP4训练方法，将与全精度训练的性能差距平均缩小51.3%。

Conclusion: TetraJet - v2是一种有效的4位全量化训练方法，能提升低精度大语言模型训练效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

Conclusion: 未提及明确具体的结论。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

Conclusion: 优化建模对所有大语言模型仍具挑战性，DeepSeek - V3和Claude - Opus - 4直接提示下准确率最高。

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

Conclusion: 传统信用分配方法在开放系统中不适用，开放性会对系统性能产生负面影响。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural
computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals,
SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more
energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive
analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional
performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike
count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient
descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP),
are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs
closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the
20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve
competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation
windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike
counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making
them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the
suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive
applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While
promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable
training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised
to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.

TL;DR: 研究发现调整脉冲神经网络的延迟异质性可在时间复杂的神经形态问题上实现先进性能，且低精度权重下也能保持高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常只关注突触权重学习，而忽略大脑可能利用的其他神经参数，如延迟，本文旨在验证延迟异质性在具身环境中的作用。

Method: 训练脉冲神经网络，使其不仅修改权重，还在不同精度水平上修改延迟。

Result: 延迟异质性使网络在时间复杂问题上达先进性能，低精度权重下也能保持，揭示了延迟和时间常数的权衡关系及任务性能与延迟分布的关联。

Conclusion: 时间异质性是高效计算的重要原则，对具身智能系统和神经形态硬件有重要意义。

Abstract: Neural networks rely on learning synaptic weights. However, this overlooks
other neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the
brain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal
dynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted
asynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay
heterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied
contexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the
time domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to
modify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of
precision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art
performance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved
even when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just
positive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely
low-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions
that maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over
an order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only
networks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and
reveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay
distributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays. Our
results suggest temporal heterogeneity is an important principle for efficient
computation, particularly when task-relevant information is temporal - as in
the physical world - with implications for embodied intelligent systems and
neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: In recent years, quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid algorithms are
increasingly showing promise for solving software engineering optimization
problems. However, best-intended practices for conducting empirical studies
have not yet well established. In this paper, based on the primary studies
identified from the latest systematic literature review on quantum optimization
for software engineering problems, we conducted a systematic analysis on these
studies from various aspects including experimental designs, hyperparameter
settings, case studies, baselines, tooling, and metrics. We identify key gaps
in the current practices such as limited reporting of the number of
repetitions, number of shots, and inadequate consideration of noise handling,
as well as a lack of standardized evaluation protocols such as the adoption of
quality metrics, especially quantum-specific metrics. Based on our analysis, we
provide insights for designing empirical studies and highlight the need for
more real-world and open case studies to assess cost-effectiveness and
practical utility of the three types of approaches: quantum-inspired, quantum,
and hybrid. This study is intended to offer an overview of current practices
and serve as an initial reference for designing and conducting empirical
studies on evaluating and comparing quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid
algorithms in solving optimization problems in software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估依赖地面真值，但常因多种原因不可用，需要更实用评估方法。

Method: 提出边际风险评估框架，强调可预测性、能力和交互优势三种相对评估方法。

Result: 该框架避免依赖地面真值或绝对风险。

Conclusion: 从绝对评估转向相对评估，为软件团队提供行动指导，帮助识别AI利弊及负责采用系统。

Abstract: Before deploying an AI system to replace an existing process, it must be
compared with the incumbent to ensure improvement without added risk.
Traditional evaluation relies on ground truth for both systems, but this is
often unavailable due to delayed or unknowable outcomes, high costs, or
incomplete data, especially for long-standing systems deemed safe by
convention. The more practical solution is not to compute absolute risk but the
difference between systems. We therefore propose a marginal risk assessment
framework, that avoids dependence on ground truth or absolute risk. It
emphasizes three kinds of relative evaluation methodology, including
predictability, capability and interaction dominance. By shifting focus from
absolute to relative evaluation, our approach equips software teams with
actionable guidance: identifying where AI enhances outcomes, where it
introduces new risks, and how to adopt such systems responsibly.

Result: 提出了集成先进数据处理和强大验证机制的工具。

Conclusion: 该创新方法结合理论与实践，促进更敏捷、可靠和以用户为中心的业务流程管理。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the verification of
business process models. Despite their lack of formal characterization, these
models are widely adopted in both industry and academia. To address this issue,
formalizing the execution semantics of business process modeling languages is
essential. Since data and process are two facets of the same coin, and data are
critical elements in the execution of process models, this work introduces
Proving an eXecutable BPMN injected with data, BPMN-ProX. BPMN-ProX is a
low-code testing framework that significantly enhances the verification of
data-aware BPMN. This low-code platform helps bridge the gap between
non-technical experts and professionals by proposing a tool that integrates
advanced data handling and employs a robust verification mechanism through
state-of-the-art model checkers. This innovative approach combines theoretical
verification with practical modeling, fostering more agile, reliable, and
user-centric business process management.

Result: 应用SparseAlign选择LaaJs用于COBOL代码解释，将高对齐评估器集成到评估工作流。

Conclusion: 通过案例研究展示了SparseAlign在实际评估场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Application modernization in legacy languages such as COBOL, PL/I, and REXX
faces an acute shortage of resources, both in expert availability and in
high-quality human evaluation data. While Large Language Models as a Judge
(LaaJ) offer a scalable alternative to expert review, their reliability must be
validated before being trusted in high-stakes workflows. Without principled
validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified
LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable
judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various
automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with
human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation
strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled
evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a
LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework
for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign
combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment
metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling
reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are
ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied
internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned
evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release
decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's
utility in real-world evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: The automotive industry is currently undergoing a major transformation with
respect to the Electric/Electronic (E/E) and software architecture, driven by a
significant increase in the complexity of the technological stack within a
vehicle. This complexity acts as a driving force for Software-Defined Vehicles
(SDVs) leading to the evolution of the automotive E/E architectures from
decentralized configuration comprising multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs)
towards a more integrated configuration comprising a smaller number of ECUs,
domain controllers, gateways, and High-Performance Computers (HPCs) [2]. This
transition along with several other reasons have resulted in heterogeneous
software platforms such as AUTOSAR Classic, AUTOSAR Adaptive, and prototypical
frameworks like ROS 2. It is therefore essential to develop applications that
are both hardware- and platform/middleware-agnostic to attain development and
integration efficiency. This work presents an application development and
integration concept to facilitate developing applications as Software as a
Product (SaaP), while simultaneously ensuring efficient integration onto
multiple software architecture platforms. The concept involves designing
applications in a hardware- and software platform-agnostic manner and
standardizing application interfaces [6]. It also includes describing the
relevant aspects of the application and corresponding middleware in a
machine-readable format to aid the integration of developed applications.
Additionally, tools are developed to facilitate semi-automation of the
development and integration processes. An example application has been
developed and integrated onto AUTOSAR Adaptive and ROS 2, demonstrating the
applicability of the approach. Finally, metrics are presented to show the
efficiency of the overall concept.

Conclusion: 大语言模型驱动的测试放大有潜力推动复杂云环境中REST API测试的自动化和可持续性。

Abstract: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a cornerstone of modern cloud
native systems. Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that
exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such
test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study
extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by
evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional
cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with
minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems
can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing
endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed
analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings
underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the
automation and sustainability of REST API testing in complex cloud
environments.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code,
evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing
benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity
of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we
introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following
capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding
problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings:
adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and
the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this
paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with
programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from
Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models
exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of
instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive
evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and
limitations across languages and generation goals.

Conclusion: 所提框架有助于设计具备机器学习能力的软件产品线，解决可变性管理难题。

Abstract: Modern software systems increasingly integrate machine learning (ML) due to
its advancements and ability to enhance data-driven decision-making. However,
this integration introduces significant challenges for software engineering,
especially in software product lines (SPLs), where managing variability and
reuse becomes more complex with the inclusion of ML components. Although
existing approaches have addressed variability management in SPLs and the
integration of ML components in isolated systems, few have explored the
intersection of both domains. Specifically, there is limited support for
modeling and managing variability in SPLs that incorporate ML components. To
bridge this gap, this article proposes a structured framework designed to
extend Software Product Line engineering, facilitating the integration of ML
components. It facilitates the design of SPLs with ML capabilities by enabling
systematic modeling of variability and reuse. The proposal has been partially
implemented with the VariaMos tool.

Conclusion: 文档未提及明确结论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for
many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code
generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task
for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning
(ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct
answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However,
choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model
performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot
examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first
criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a
sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about
its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity
of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples
based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations
to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under
various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 这些结果是迈向自动AI辅助形式验证目标的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax

In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in

Abstract: This paper proposes the Exact Terminal Condition Neural Network (ETCNN), a
deep learning framework for accurately pricing American options by solving the
Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) equations. The ETCNN incorporates carefully designed
functions that ensure the numerical solution not only exactly satisfies the
terminal condition of the BSM equations but also matches the non-smooth and
singular behavior of the option price near expiration. This method effectively
addresses the challenges posed by the inequality constraints in the BSM
equations and can be easily extended to high-dimensional scenarios.
Additionally, input normalization is employed to maintain the homogeneity.
Multiple experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves high accuracy and exhibits robustness across various situations,
outperforming both traditional numerical methods and other machine learning
approaches.

Motivation: 研究中频交易代理被高频交易者逆向选择的机制，因高频交易在金融市场扩散，中频交易者逆向选择问题加剧。

Method: 在Hawkes限价订单簿模型中使用强化学习，通过脉冲控制强化学习框架构建高频做市代理，采用近端策略优化和自我模仿学习。

Result: 强化学习做市代理通过训练学会利用元订单引起的价格漂移获利，未观察到做市代理利润增加必然导致中频交易代理滑点显著增加。

Conclusion: 随着高频交易扩散，中频交易者滑点成本可能上升，但做市代理利润增加与中频交易者滑点成本上升无必然显著联系。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are
adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use
reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in
order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast
to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes
model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the
market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market
maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the
high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement
learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate
the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium
frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with
training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent
learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent
empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly
subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As
high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the
slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over
time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making
RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.

Conclusion: 为理解过指定 MDA 性能提供严格理论框架，用遥感数据集实验验证理论。

Abstract: This study explores the classification error of Mixture Discriminant Analysis
(MDA) in scenarios where the number of mixture components exceeds those present
in the actual data distribution, a condition known as overspecification. We use
a two-component Gaussian mixture model within each class to fit data generated
from a single Gaussian, analyzing both the algorithmic convergence of the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the statistical classification
error. We demonstrate that, with suitable initialization, the EM algorithm
converges exponentially fast to the Bayes risk at the population level.
Further, we extend our results to finite samples, showing that the
classification error converges to Bayes risk with a rate $n^{-1/2}$ under mild
conditions on the initial parameter estimates and sample size. This work
provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the performance of
overspecified MDA, which is often used empirically in complex data settings,
such as image and text classification. To validate our theory, we conduct

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adding entropic regularization to Optimal Transport (OT) problems has become
a standard approach for designing efficient and scalable solvers. However,
regularization introduces a bias from the true solution. To mitigate this bias
while still benefiting from the acceleration provided by regularization, a
natural solver would adaptively decrease the regularization as it approaches
the solution. Although some algorithms heuristically implement this idea, their
theoretical guarantees and the extent of their acceleration compared to using a
fixed regularization remain largely open. In the setting of semi-discrete OT,
where the source measure is continuous and the target is discrete, we prove
that decreasing the regularization can indeed accelerate convergence. To this
end, we introduce DRAG: Decreasing (entropic) Regularization Averaged Gradient,
a stochastic gradient descent algorithm where the regularization decreases with
the number of optimization steps. We provide a theoretical analysis showing
that DRAG benefits from decreasing regularization compared to a fixed scheme,
achieving an unbiased $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sample and iteration complexity for
both the OT cost and the potential estimation, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$
rate for the OT map. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical
experiments that validate the effectiveness of DRAG and highlight its practical
advantages.

Result: 发现考虑最优向量场可使Flow Matching通向Action Matching

Conclusion: 表明考虑最优向量场在不同生成建模方法中有不同表现，为相关研究提供新视角

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) method in generative modeling maps arbitrary probability
distributions by constructing an interpolation between them and then learning
the vector field that defines ODE for this interpolation. Recently, it was
shown that FM can be modified to map distributions optimally in terms of the
quadratic cost function for any initial interpolation. To achieve this, only
specific optimal vector fields, which are typical for solutions of Optimal
Transport (OT) problems, need to be considered during FM loss minimization. In
this note, we show that considering only optimal vector fields can lead to OT
in another approach: Action Matching (AM). Unlike FM, which learns a vector
field for a manually chosen interpolation between given distributions, AM
learns the vector field that defines ODE for an entire given sequence of
distributions.

Motivation: 機器學習模型因缺乏解釋性不適用於金融等受監管行業，現有模型無關框架難以提供因果解釋，反事實案例解釋有優勢但存在搜尋和解釋挑戰。

Method: 將反事實搜索和解釋問題轉化為相似度學習，利用隨機森林預測模型的表示，找到反事實後根據跨越的隨機森林劃分計算特徵重要性。

Result: 在MNIST手繪數字數據集和德國信用數據集上的結果表明，該方法生成的解釋比Shapley值更稀疏、更有用。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在生成解釋方面比Shapley值更有效。

Abstract: Despite their enormous predictive power, machine learning models are often
unsuitable for applications in regulated industries such as finance, due to
their limited capacity to provide explanations. While model-agnostic frameworks
such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely
align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after.
Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of
which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome,
may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate
counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features
are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of
counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning,
exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model
itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the
explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are
crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this
method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit
dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more
useful than Shapley values.

Conclusion: 基于置换的SW检验结合了有限样本有效性、竞争力和可扩展性，且无需像核基检验那样仔细调参，在各场景表现一致良好。

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric two-sample testing using the sliced
Wasserstein (SW) distance. While prior theoretical and empirical work indicates
that the SW distance offers a promising balance between strong statistical
guarantees and computational efficiency, its theoretical foundations for
hypothesis testing remain limited. We address this gap by proposing a
permutation-based SW test and analyzing its performance. The test inherits
finite-sample Type I error control from the permutation principle. Moreover, we
establish non-asymptotic power bounds and show that the procedure achieves the
minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$ over multinomial and bounded-support
alternatives, matching the optimal guarantees of kernel-based tests while
building on the geometric foundations of Wasserstein distances. Our analysis
further quantifies the trade-off between the number of projections and
statistical power. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the test
combines finite-sample validity with competitive power and scalability, and --
unlike kernel-based tests, which require careful kernel tuning -- it performs
consistently well across all scenarios we consider.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs.
Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate
or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms
that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to
guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are
tailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\'ern Gaussian process
prior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric
graphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently
smooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the
smoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\'ern prior is
represented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on
a synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori
estimation on a telecommunication network.

Motivation: 现有对DDPM的理论理解有限，尤其是其收敛性质，因此需要进行更精细的收敛分析。

Method: 引入由常数L参数化的松弛平滑条件，对具有准确分数估计的DDPM采样器进行分析。

Result: 证明DDPM采样器在Kullback - Leibler散度下收敛率为\(\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2}\right)\)，当\(L < \sqrt{d}\)时优于已知的\(d^2/T^2\)速率，且建立了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 收敛分析对多种目标分布是紧的，揭示DDPM和DDIM对d的依赖性相同，引出DDIM经验上更快的问题。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in
generating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used
samplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its
empirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its
convergence properties -- remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler
and establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional
assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition
parameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical
distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler
with accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of
$$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2}\right)~\text{in
Kullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the
number of iterations, and $\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.
This result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <
\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence
analysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it
reveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an
interesting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模糊聚类算法多针对静态低维数据，难以处理MTS的时间依赖、不等序列长度、高维性及噪声等问题。

Method: 引入RFCPCA方法，学习成员信息子空间、适应不等长度和较高维度、通过修剪等实现鲁棒性、自动选择超参数。

Result: RFCPCA能捕捉潜在时间结构、提供校准的成员不确定性、标记异常值，在驾驶员困倦脑电图上提高聚类准确性。

Conclusion: RFCPCA是适用于MTS的有效聚类方法，在相关数据上表现优于相关方法。

Abstract: Fuzzy clustering provides a natural framework for modeling partial
memberships, particularly important in multivariate time series (MTS) where
state boundaries are often ambiguous. For example, in EEG monitoring of driver
alertness, neural activity evolves along a continuum (from unconscious to fully
alert, with many intermediate levels of drowsiness) so crisp labels are
unrealistic and partial memberships are essential. However, most existing
algorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with
temporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and
contamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce
RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS
that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously:
(i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and
moderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming,
exponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically
select all required hyperparameters. These components enable RFCPCA to capture
latent temporal structure, provide calibrated membership uncertainty, and flag
series-level outliers while remaining stable under contamination. On driver
drowsiness EEG, RFCPCA improves clustering accuracy over related methods and
yields a more reliable characterization of uncertainty and outlier structure in
MTS.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of identifying a minimal subset of

Tests on simulated data demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify
influential variables while minimizing spurious selections, even with small

problem.

Result: 比基于梯度的方案（如Adam）收敛更快，区域分解减少了每次迭代的计算成本。

Conclusion: 结合局部化和高斯牛顿优化对基于神经网络的偏微分方程求解器有前景。

Abstract: Approximating the solutions of boundary value problems governed by partial
differential equations with neural networks is challenging, largely due to the
difficult training process. This difficulty can be partly explained by the
spectral bias, that is, the slower convergence of high-frequency components,
and can be mitigated by localizing neural networks via (overlapping) domain
decomposition. We combine this localization with the Gauss-Newton method as the
optimizer to obtain faster convergence than gradient-based schemes such as
Adam; this comes at the cost of solving an ill-conditioned linear system in
each iteration. Domain decomposition induces a block-sparse structure in the
otherwise dense Gauss-Newton system, reducing the computational cost per
iteration. Our numerical results indicate that combining localization and
Gauss-Newton optimization is promising for neural network-based solvers for
partial differential equations.

Abstract: Employers are concerned not only with a prospective worker's ability, but
also their propensity to avoid shirking. This paper proposes a new experimental
framework to study how Principals trade-off measures of ability and prosocial
behavior when ranking Agents for independent jobs. Subjects participate in a
simulated, incentivized job market. In an initial session, subjects are Workers
and generate a database of signals and job results. Managers in subsequent

before a rank-and-value task, ranking and reporting a value for each Worker for
two distinct jobs. Results highlight Managers' preference for ability over
prosocial behavior on average, especially for Managers in STEM fields. There is
evidence of homophily: the relative value of prosocial behavior is higher for
highly prosocial Managers, compensating for ability or even surpassing it in

Abstract: We analyze the delegation of pricing by participants, representing firms, to
a collusive, self-learning algorithm in a repeated Bertrand experiment. In the
baseline treatment, participants set prices themselves. In the other
treatments, participants can either delegate pricing to the algorithm at the
beginning of each supergame or receive algorithmic recommendations that they
can override. Participants delegate more when they can override the algorithm's
decisions. In both algorithmic treatments, prices are lower than in the
baseline. Our results indicate that while self-learning pricing algorithms can
be collusive, they can foster competition rather than collusion with
humans-in-the-loop.

Abstract: Auditory sensory overload affects 50-70% of individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD), yet existing approaches, such as mechanistic models (Hodgkin
Huxley type, Wilson Cowan, excitation inhibition balance), clinical tools
(EEG/MEG, Sensory Profile scales), and ML methods (Neural ODEs, predictive
coding), either assume fixed parameters or lack interpretability, missing
autism heterogeneity. We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using
Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in
autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in
biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and
individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement
over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model
successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides
a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for
pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes
foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with
direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.

Abstract: Particle accelerators play a pivotal role in advancing scientific research,
yet optimizing beamline configurations to maximize particle transmission
remains a labor-intensive task requiring expert intervention. In this work, we
introduce RLABC (Reinforcement Learning for Accelerator Beamline Control), a
Python-based library that reframes beamline optimization as a reinforcement

automates the creation of an RL environment from standard lattice and element
input files, enabling sequential tuning of magnets to minimize particle losses.
We define a comprehensive state representation capturing beam statistics,
actions for adjusting magnet parameters, and a reward function focused on
transmission efficiency. Employing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) algorithm, we demonstrate RLABC's efficacy on two beamlines, achieving
transmission rates of 94% and 91%, comparable to expert manual optimizations.
This approach bridges accelerator physics and machine learning, offering a

Abstract: We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating
model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of
visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our
dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness
against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack
benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular
models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on
attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious
correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes
(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in
our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's
realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform
evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further
explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of
traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus
on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance
between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework
contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign
recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and
distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in
developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving

### [165] [Broken-Token: Filtering Obfuscated Prompts by Counting Characters-Per-Token](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26847)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代方法抵御大语言模型越狱攻击计算成本高，依赖额外模块，如专用大语言模型或困惑度模型。

Method: 基于BPE分词器特性，使用文本中每个标记的平均字符数（CPT），设置简单的CPT阈值来识别编码文本。

Result: 在超10万个提示的大数据集上验证，该方法能以高准确率识别编码文本，即使对短输入也有效。

Conclusion: CPT - Filtering是实用的防御层，可立即用于实时文本过滤和离线数据整理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where
malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to
bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the
encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful
instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with
negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to
mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that
tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,
such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our
technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the
average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is
motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules
such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a
large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with
several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT
threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very
short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be
immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.

Method: 提出结合ML进行多类攻击检测、LLM进行攻击行为分析和缓解建议的混合框架；在数据集上对ML和DL分类器进行基准测试；采用结构化角色扮演提示工程结合RAG引导LLM生成响应；引入新评估指标，用多个法官LLM独立评估响应。

Result: 随机森林是最佳检测模型，ChatGPT - o3在攻击分析和缓解方面优于DeepSeek - R1。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合框架及评估方法有助于更有效评估和提升物联网AI安全模型的性能。

Abstract: The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and
operations across industries but also increasing the attack surface and
security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT,
enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion.
Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a
standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack
analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness.
In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for
multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack
behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion. After benchmarking several ML and
Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we
applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to guide ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 in producing detailed,
context-aware responses. We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative
assessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon
H1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the
responses. Results show that Random Forest has the best detection model, and
ChatGPT-o3 outperformed DeepSeek-R1 in attack analysis and mitigation.

Result: 通过研究发现混合检索能增强大语言模型在网络安全任务中的适应性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 混合检索在加强大语言模型用于网络安全任务的适应性和可靠性方面有前景。

Abstract: Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models
(LLMs) for cyber threat detection; however, their opaque reasoning often limits
trust, particularly in decisions that require domain-specific cybersecurity
knowledge. Because security threats evolve rapidly, LLMs must not only recall
historical incidents but also adapt to emerging vulnerabilities and attack
patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness
in general LLM applications, but its potential for cybersecurity remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce a RAG-based framework designed to
contextualize cybersecurity data and enhance LLM accuracy in knowledge
retention and temporal reasoning. Using external datasets and the
Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, we evaluate baseline RAG, an optimized hybrid
retrieval approach, and conduct a comparative analysis across multiple
performance metrics. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid retrieval in
strengthening the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入自动化多阶段流程，处理阶段间未经验证的信任产生的风险模式成为实际问题。

Method: 提出以机制为中心的41种重复风险模式分类。

Result: 分析显示输入常被非中性解读，能触发特定响应或非预期状态改变，字符串级过滤不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用零信任架构原则缓解跨阶段漏洞，引入“Countermind”作为实现防御的概念蓝图。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated,
multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between
processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a
mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs.
The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can
trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even
without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute
architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is
insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend
zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context
sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce "Countermind" as a conceptual
blueprint for implementing these defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理对x402 HTTP服务消费增加，服务发现变得关键，需解决信任和可靠性问题，且避免基础设施偏差。

Method: 引入TraceRank声誉加权排名算法，通过支付流传播声誉，结合语义搜索。

Result: 能找出高声誉用户偏好的服务，结合语义搜索可高质量响应自然语言查询。

Conclusion: 声誉传播能抵抗Sybil攻击，构建的搜索方法优于纯基于交易量或语义的方法。

Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application
programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept
cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these
services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent
trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a
reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as
endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and
propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and
temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services
preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction
volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to
natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation
propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many
low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation
payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled
services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely
volume based or semantic methods.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding
great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they
could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the
risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous
data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach
remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune
these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a
framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce
the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models'
virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,
mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that
current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded
knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits
broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals
may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via
simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data
filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research
into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有舞蹈到音乐生成方法依赖粗粒度节奏嵌入，丢弃细粒度运动线索，且特征下采样导致时间不匹配，影响舞蹈与音乐同步。

Method: 提出基于扩散变压器的GACA - DiT框架，包含流派自适应节奏提取模块和上下文感知时间对齐模块。

Result: 在AIST++和TikTok数据集上的实验表明，GACA - DiT在客观指标和人工评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACA - DiT框架能有效解决舞蹈到音乐生成中的节奏对齐和时间同步问题。

Abstract: Dance-to-music (D2M) generation aims to automatically compose music that is
rhythmically and temporally aligned with dance movements. Existing methods
typically rely on coarse rhythm embeddings, such as global motion features or
binarized joint-based rhythm values, which discard fine-grained motion cues and
result in weak rhythmic alignment. Moreover, temporal mismatches introduced by
feature downsampling further hinder precise synchronization between dance and
music. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{GACA-DiT}, a diffusion
transformer-based framework with two novel modules for rhythmically consistent
and temporally aligned music generation. First, a \textbf{genre-adaptive rhythm
extraction} module combines multi-scale temporal wavelet analysis and spatial
phase histograms with adaptive joint weighting to capture fine-grained,
genre-specific rhythm patterns. Second, a \textbf{context-aware temporal
alignment} module resolves temporal mismatches using learnable context queries
to align music latents with relevant dance rhythm features. Extensive
experiments on the AIST++ and TikTok datasets demonstrate that GACA-DiT
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and human
evaluation. Project page: https://beria-moon.github.io/GACA-DiT/.

Motivation: 语音情感识别对低资源语言如乌尔都语具有挑战性，且跨语料库设置的乌尔都语语音情感识别研究较少。

Method: 采用跨语料库评估框架，使用eGeMAPS和ComParE特征集，结合逻辑回归和多层感知器分类器，用未加权平均召回率评估性能并考虑类别标签不平衡。

Conclusion: 强调跨语料库验证对乌尔都语语音情感识别的重要性，推动了针对代表性不足语言社区的情感计算研究。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key affective computing technology that
enables emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence. While SER is
challenging in general, it is particularly difficult for low-resource languages
such as Urdu. This study investigates Urdu SER in a cross-corpus setting, an
area that has remained largely unexplored. We employ a cross-corpus evaluation
framework across three different Urdu emotional speech datasets to test model
generalization. Two standard domain-knowledge based acoustic feature sets,
eGeMAPS and ComParE, are used to represent speech signals as feature vectors
which are then passed to Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron
classifiers. Classification performance is assessed using unweighted average
recall (UAR) whilst considering class-label imbalance. Results show that
Self-corpus validation often overestimates performance, with UAR exceeding
cross-corpus evaluation by up to 13%, underscoring that cross-corpus evaluation
offers a more realistic measure of model robustness. Overall, this work
emphasizes the importance of cross-corpus validation for Urdu SER and its
implications contribute to advancing affective computing research for
underrepresented language communities.

TL;DR: 本文将表达范围分析（ERA）方法应用于文本到音频模型，通过特定固定提示进行实验并分析音频，提供了基于ERA的生成式音频模型探索性评估框架。


<details>

Motivation: 目前不清楚文本到音频模型具体生成内容、可变性和保真度，且音频输出范围广，而ERA在PCG社区用于表征生成器输出空间，因此想将其应用于文本到音频模型。

Method: 将ERA方法应用于文本到音频模型，使用从ESC - 50数据集得到的标准化提示来驱动模型，分析生成音频的关键声学维度。

Result: 对模型生成的音频在关键声学维度上进行了分析。

Conclusion: 提供了一个基于ERA的生成式音频模型探索性评估框架。

Abstract: Text-to-audio models are a type of generative model that produces audio
output in response to a given textual prompt. Although level generators and the
properties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability)
dominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that
emotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative
and multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and
multimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose.
However, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what
degree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output
for a generative system to target.
  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a
quantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level
generators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis
tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed
prompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several
standardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification
(ESC-50) dataset. The resulting audio is analyzed along key acoustic dimensions
(e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre). More broadly, this paper offers a
framework for ERA-based exploratory evaluation of generative audio models.

Abstract: Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical
compositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational
musicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive
models such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt
theory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical
structure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that
operationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and
annotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic
Time Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and
inter-segment relationships.
  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further
labeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor
I-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level.
This labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive
information, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and
resolution.
  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the
Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within
compositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between
intra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional
scaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects
perceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering
demonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural
features that extend beyond composer identity.
  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a
structured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis,
enabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through
the lens of listener perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量计算机断层扫描（LDCT）在肺癌筛查中的应用和可及性有限，且存在假阳性问题，探究DFI结合深度学习分割能否显著改善早期肺癌检测。

Method: 使用安乐死小鼠肺部的衰减（ATTN）和DFI射线照相配对图像生成合成肿瘤，用U-Net分割网络在小斑块上分别基于ATTN、DFI或两者结合的通道进行训练。

Result: DFI单独模型真阳性检测率达83.7%，ATTN单独为51%；两者结合输入灵敏度达79.6%，特异性达97.6%。

Conclusion: DFI相比标准衰减射线照相大幅提高早期肿瘤可检测性，有潜力作为LDCT不可用时的替代筛查方法。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer
screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack
LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer
detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening
Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of
26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)
radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar
microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly
improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning
segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of
euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular
boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A
U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,
or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model
achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51
percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus
92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent
sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially
improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation
radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose
alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is
unavailable.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了应对储能调度不确定性的通用方法，允许运营商根据风险承受能力做资产决策。

Abstract: Energy storage can promote the integration of renewables by operating with
charge and discharge policies that balance an intermittent power supply. This
study investigates the scheduling of energy storage assets under energy price
uncertainty, with a focus on electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic
risk-constrained approach is employed, whereby electricity price trajectories
or specific power markets are observed, allowing for recourse in the schedule.
Conditional value-at-risk is used to quantify tail risk in the optimization
problems; this allows for the explicit specification of a probabilistic risk
limit. The proposed approach is tested in an integrated hydrogen system (IHS)
and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In the joint design and operation
context for the IHS, the risk constraint results in larger installed unit
capacities, increasing capital cost but enabling more energy inventory to
buffer price uncertainty. As shown in both case studies, there is an
operational trade-off between risk and expected reward; this is reflected in
higher expected costs (or lower expected profits) with increasing levels of
risk aversion. Despite the decrease in expected reward, both systems exhibit
substantial benefits of increasing risk aversion. This work provides a general
method to address uncertainties in energy storage scheduling, allowing
operators to input their level of risk tolerance on asset decisions.

Motivation: 现有MMSE去噪器作为近端算子虽能保证PnP方法渐近收敛，但未揭示正则化器结构和收敛速率。

Method: 证明MMSE去噪器对应正则化器可表示为负对数边缘密度的上Moreau包络，且该正则化器是1 - 弱凸的，利用此性质推导收敛保证。

Result: 得到PnP近端梯度下降的首个次线性收敛保证，一维合成研究恢复隐式正则化器，成像实验展现预测的次线性行为。

Conclusion: 理论推导的收敛保证得到了实验验证。

Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under
Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for
asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the
structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that
the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly
as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn
implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive
(to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for
PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory
with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer.
We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed
tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.

Motivation: 现代量子处理单元受限于最近邻交互，此前的量子比特映射方法未充分利用依赖信息，且需在引入SWAP门时最小化其数量以降低量子程序误差。

Method: 引入基于传递依赖权重的量子比特映射算法，用仿射抽象对量子电路建模，计算传递依赖，按依赖距离划分电路并计算各层权重。

Conclusion: 基于传递依赖权重的量子比特映射算法有效，能提升量子编译性能。

Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical task in Quantum Compilation, as modern Quantum
Processing Units (QPUs) are constrained to nearest-neighbor interactions
defined by a qubit coupling graph. This compiler pass repairs the connectivity
of two-qubit gates whose operands are not adjacent by inserting SWAP gates that
move the state of qubits between directly connected qubits. Deciding when to
introduce SWAPs while minimizing their count is critical because the error in
quantum programs increases exponentially with the circuit latency, measured in
number of gates along the critical path of the circuit. Prior work for this
problem relied on heuristics and exact methods that partition the circuit into
two or more layers, but failed to exploit valuable dependence information in
any form.
  This paper introduces a novel qubit mapping algorithm based on the weight of
transitive dependences. The introduced mapper models quantum circuits with
affine abstractions thereby yielding the ability to compute transitive
dependences. In turn, the newfound information is used to partition circuits by
dependence distances and compute, efficiently, distinct weights for each layer.
We evaluate the efficiency of our mapper on IBM and Rigetti QPUs, using the
large datasets from the QUEKO and QASMBench benchmark suites, and against four
baseline tools (QMAP, Sabre, Cirq and TKET), demonstrating notable improvements
in circuit depth and swap count while delivering competitive scalability.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于单一方法基线和现有混合方法，F1分数分别达0.96、0.82和0.77；鲁棒性测试表现稳定；可解释性分析显示Grad - CAM和法医热图与真实篡改区域重叠率达82%。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了深度模型适应性和法医线索可解释性，为开发可靠可信的深度伪造检测系统提供平衡解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文指出当前视频检索范式存在结构失调问题，提出评估、数据和建模协同设计框架，构建UVRB基准，生成合成数据，设计训练课程，实验表明GVE在UVRB上零样本泛化达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索范式因狭窄基准导致数据和训练受限，缺乏多维度泛化诊断评估，抑制了通用能力，需打破此循环。

Method: 建立Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB)；引入可扩展合成工作流生成数据；设计Modality Pyramid课程训练General Video Embedder (GVE)。

Result: GVE在UVRB上实现了最先进的零样本泛化，分析发现流行基准难以预测通用能力，部分相关检索是被忽视的主要场景。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架为突破有限范围、实现真正通用视频检索提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文提出CroVCA方法学习二进制码，设计HashCoder网络，5个训练周期就达到SOTA，效率高、适应性强、适用性广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模检索方法在高维空间计算成本高，哈希方法存在管道复杂、目标多样等问题，需更高效方法。

Method: 引入CroVCA原则学习跨语义对齐视图一致的二进制码，用单一二元交叉熵损失和编码率最大化正则化；设计HashCoder轻量级MLP哈希网络；可作为探测头或通过LoRA微调适配编码器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，5个训练周期达到SOTA，如在COCO上无监督哈希不到2分钟，在ImageNet100上有监督哈希约3分钟。

Conclusion: CroVCA效率高、适应性强、适用性广。

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉测量读数任务上表现不佳，需要评估和改进其能力。

Method: 引入MeasureBench基准和可扩展的数据合成管道，对流行的VLMs进行评估，并在合成数据上进行强化学习实验。

Result: 最强的前沿VLMs在测量读数上表现不佳，常见失败模式是指示器定位错误；强化学习在合成子集上结果较好，但在真实图像上不太理想。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在细粒度空间定位上存在根本局限，MeasureBench资源有望推动VLMs在视觉数值计算和精确空间感知方面的发展。

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

Method: 提出SACL，包含自适应epoch调度、难样本注入和尺度感知优化三种机制，用YOLOv11在LUNA25数据集上评估。

Result: 在全量数据上mAP50表现与静态课程学习相当，在10%、20%和50%训练数据的有限数据条件下，分别比基线提升4.6%、3.5%和2.0%。

Conclusion: SACL无需架构修改，能在不同数据规模下实现稳健训练，为医疗结构开发肺结节检测系统提供实用方案。

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI到图像重建方法依赖特定主体模型或微调，限制可扩展性和实际应用，需解决此问题。

Method: 基于fMRI表征可分解为主体相关和语义相关组件的见解，利用对抗训练分离这两个组件，以获得主体不变、语义特定的表征。

Result: ZEBRA显著优于零样本基线，在多个指标上达到与全微调模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究是迈向通用神经解码可扩展且实用的一步。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

TL;DR: 现有视觉语言模型处理高分辨率图像时难生成准确详细的图像描述，论文提出新的集成管道改善这一问题并取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常在低分辨率图像上预训练，将高分辨率图像降维会丢失细节，难以生成准确详细的图像描述。

Method: 提出了一个集成视觉语言模型、大语言模型和目标检测系统的新管道，通过多阶段过程细化图像描述。

Result: 使用成对比较、大模态模型定量评分和幻觉检测基准评估，在高分辨率图像数据集上实验表明，该管道生成的图像描述更详细可靠，有效减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 所提出的管道能有效提升高分辨率图像描述的质量，减少幻觉。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Motivation: 扩散模型迭代去噪计算成本高，现有缓存技术在速度和保真度间难平衡。

Method: 引入H2 - Cache，基于去噪过程分阶段的见解，采用双阈值系统选择性缓存，用PFS进行特征总结。

Result: 在Flux架构实验中，H2 - Cache加速达5.08倍，图像质量与基线相近，优于现有缓存方法。

Conclusion: H2 - Cache有效解决速度 - 质量困境，降低高保真扩散模型实际应用门槛。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

Result: 在University - 1652和SUES - 200基准上实验，相比现有方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: 提出的DPHR策略有效且稳健。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 所提稀疏模型反演策略能有效加速模型反演，且不影响下游任务表现。

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

Result: T^3在Top-1准确率和误差减少方面达SOTA，优于基线并保持效率。

Conclusion: 研究为自适应多模态视觉语言模型在临床部署铺平道路。

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出FOCUS用于长视频关键帧选择，在长视频问答基准上提升准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有关键帧选择方法需预过滤且可能遗漏重要时刻，无法处理长视频token预算问题。

Method: 将关键帧选择建模为多臂老虎机的组合纯探索问题，采用两阶段探索-利用过程。

Result: 在两个长视频问答基准上，处理不到2%视频帧时大幅提升准确率，20分钟以上视频在LongVideoBench上准确率提高11.9%。

Conclusion: FOCUS是有效的关键帧选择方法，为MLLMs可扩展长视频理解提供简单通用方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测冠心病很重要，但血管造影图像质量差会阻碍临床诊断，需更好的方法。

Method: 提出包含图像预处理、分割和细化的三阶段CASR - Net，采用新的多通道预处理策略，核心分割网络基于UNet，有DenseNet121编码器和Self - ONN解码器，最后有轮廓细化模块。

Result: 多通道预处理策略提高DSC和IoU，CASR - Net在两个公共数据集上5折交叉验证，IoU达61.43%，DSC达76.10%，clDice达79.36%，优于多个先进模型。

Conclusion: CASR - Net是一种稳健的自动冠状动脉分割方法，可为临床医生诊断和治疗规划提供有价值的工具。

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无梯度的前馈式参数选择方法FPS，可在单前向传播中选最优参数子集，在24个视觉任务上表现好，减少内存使用并加速参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在缺陷，加法类方法有推理延迟和工程复杂性，选择类方法需完整反向传播，峰值内存使用高。

Method: 提出前馈式参数选择（FPS），通过参数大小和对应输入激活值乘积对参数排序，利用预训练知识和下游数据。

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB - 1k的24个视觉任务上，性能与现有最优方法相当，峰值内存使用减少近9倍，参数选择加速约2倍。

Conclusion: FPS是大规模预训练模型微调中真正内存高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低通信带宽的挑战性场景下，准确重建视觉场景并保证视觉分析精度和人机交互性能，同时降低比特率的问题。

Method: 将图像生成与深度图像压缩无缝集成，使用联合文本和编码隐变量引导修正流模型精确生成视觉场景，并以低比特率编码和传输语义文本描述与编码隐变量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在使用更少带宽的情况下，能达到与现有方法相同的图像重建质量和视觉分析精度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了低带宽场景下超低比特率视觉通信问题，节省了带宽。

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 完整的训练和推理流程已发布，支持跨电影领域的可重复性和适应性。

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

TL;DR: 现有视觉 - 语言模型模态对齐方法存在不对称问题，本文提出Alignment across Trees方法，在多图像数据集分类任务中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉 - 语言模型模态对齐方法提取特征不对称，导致对齐效果不佳。

Method: 为图像和文本构建树状层次特征并对齐；引入语义感知视觉特征提取框架；将特征树嵌入不同曲率双曲流形；用KL距离度量并学习中间流形进行对齐。

Result: 在多图像数据集的分类任务中，该方法在少样本和跨领域设置下始终优于强基线。

Conclusion: 提出的Alignment across Trees方法能有效解决模态对齐问题，提升视觉 - 语言模型性能。

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Method: 审计乳腺癌肿瘤分割数据集MAMA - MIA中自动分割标签的公平性，评估不同年龄、种族和数据源下的自动分割质量。

Result: 发现存在针对年轻患者的年龄相关偏差，控制数据源等混杂因素后仍存在；揭示聚合多数据源数据会影响特定地点的种族偏差。

Conclusion: 有必要在细粒度层面研究数据以解决分割偏差问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

Result: 在部分相关视频检索基准测试中，框架有效防止语义崩溃，显著提高检索准确率。

Conclusion: 所提方法能解决语义崩溃问题，提升部分相关视频检索性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D

computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Minimum joins in a graft $(G, T)$, also known as minimum $T$-joins of a graph
$G$, are said to be connected if they determine a connected subgraph of $G$.
Grafts with a connected minimum join have gained interest ever since Middendorf
and Pfeiffer showed that they satisfy Seymour's min-max formula for joins and
$T$-cut packings; that is, in such grafts, the size of a minimum join is equal
to the size of a maximum packing of $T$-cuts. In this paper, we provide a
constructive characterization of grafts with a connected minimum join. We also
obtain a polynomial time algorithm that decides whether a given graft has a
connected minimum join and, if so, outputs one. Our algorithm has two
bottlenecks; one is the time required to compute a minimum join of a graft, and
the other is the time required to solve the single-source all-sink shortest
path problem in a graph with conservative $\pm 1$-valued edge weights. Thus,
our algorithm runs in $O(n(m + n\log n) )$ time. In the nondense case, it
improves upon the time bound for this problem due to Seb\H{o} and Tannier that
was introduced as an application of their results on metrics on graphs.

Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to
the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has
primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search
(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for
evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing
approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation
metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce
weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored
for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:
the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative
contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.
Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize
the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating
lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and
SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and
achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous
state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking
evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach
exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared
to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大预训练语言模型计算和内存需求大，带来经济和环境问题。

Method: 引入ELM，扩展NAS方法，采用灵活搜索空间和动态模块，引入新的知识蒸馏损失。

Result: 在掩码语言建模和因果语言建模任务中，ELM发现的模型显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ELM方法有效，能更高效灵活地探索模型架构。

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估大语言模型长上下文推理能力时存在缺乏叙事连贯性、领域狭窄、仅测试简单回忆任务等问题。

Method: 提出自动生成对话框架构建BEAM基准，包含100个对话和2000个验证问题；提出LIGHT框架，为大语言模型配备三种互补记忆系统。

Result: 实验表明即使有100万标记上下文窗口的大语言模型在对话变长时仍有困难，LIGHT能持续提升不同模型性能，平均提升3.5%-12.69%，消融研究证实各记忆组件的作用。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架能有效提升大语言模型在长上下文推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer
architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for
different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for
neural network structures with better translation results, we considered
perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to
BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the
population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show
that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the
baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric
can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation
metric.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,

Result: 发现捕捉文化细微差别存在挑战，尤其是澄清性和习语表达，此类情况易出现大量误报。

Conclusion: 在豪萨语性别歧视检测中，需解决捕捉文化细微差别的问题，减少误报。

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

Result: CoDeC能产生可解释的污染分数，区分见过和未见过的数据集，揭示开放权重模型的记忆证据。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、自动，与模型和数据集无关，易于集成到基准评估中。

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Result: 框架有效减少评估偏差，判断结果与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: MemeArena为mLLMs多模态有害性理解评估提供可靠且全面的见解，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

Result: 大幅改善双语检索，在大语言模型评判的问答评估中比基础模型有81.3%的偏好，比直接微调有63.6%的偏好。

Conclusion: 将低资源语言作为一种模态为轻量级大语言模型实现更强跨语言对齐提供了实用途径，不过模型在数值保真度上仍有弱点。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IntAttn - Edit比先前方法有更高编辑成功率、更好泛化性和更强知识保留能力。平衡策略使编辑性能在不同设置下保持在最佳范围。

Conclusion: IntAttn - Edit方法通过联合更新MLP和Attn模块并采用知识平衡策略，提升了知识编辑效果。

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

Conclusion: BiSparse - AAS为现实文本摘要应用提供统一实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失在长CoT轨迹监督微调中对所有token一视同仁，导致监督分配不当和泛化能力弱，尤其在复杂长推理任务中。

Method: 引入VCORE框架，将CoT监督重新表述为约束优化问题，实现token监督的原则性和自适应分配。

Result: VCORE在数学和编码基准测试中，在域内和域外设置下均优于现有token重加权方法，在Qwen3系列和LLaMA - 3.1 - 8B - Instruct模型上取得显著性能提升，且能为后续强化学习提供更有效初始化。

Conclusion: VCORE是提升大语言模型推理能力的有效方法，代码将公开。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

Conclusion: 可增强推测执行以提供近似验证，且性能无显著下降。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

TL;DR: 提出DialectalArabicMMLU基准，扩展MMLU - Redux框架，评估19个大语言模型，发现方言泛化差距，促进更包容评估和模型发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准对现代标准阿拉伯语评估有进展，但方言评估不足，而方言在日常交流中普遍使用，需要新基准评估大语言模型在阿拉伯语方言上的表现。

Method: 手动翻译和调整3K道选择题问答对到5种主要方言，扩展MMLU - Redux框架，得到15K个问答对，评估19个阿拉伯语和多语言大语言模型。

Result: 评估发现不同方言间模型性能有显著差异，方言泛化存在持续差距。

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU是首个用于衡量阿拉伯语方言理解的统一、人工整理资源，可促进更包容评估和未来模型开发。

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

TL;DR: 提出连续自回归语言模型CALM，从离散的下一个标记预测转变为连续的下一个向量预测，减少生成步骤，提高性能计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型顺序、逐标记生成过程限制效率，需新设计轴增加生成步骤语义带宽。

Method: 引入CALM，用高保真自动编码器将K个标记压缩为连续向量，开发无似然框架用于连续域训练、评估和采样。

Result: CALM显著改善性能计算权衡，以更低计算成本达到强离散基线性能。

Conclusion: 下一个向量预测是实现超高效语言模型的强大可扩展途径。

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圣劳伦斯河口海洋哺乳动物自动监测面临声音频段跨度大、重叠且有噪声等挑战。

Method: 提出多步注意力引导框架，先分割频谱图生成掩码，再与原始输入融合用于多频段去噪分类，通过中级融合集成图像和掩码嵌入。

Result: 分割驱动的注意力和中级融合提高了信号辨别能力，减少误报，在不同环境条件和信噪比下表现良好；MGC在分布转移情况下性能稳定，简单融合机制也有可比结果。

Conclusion: MGC框架在所有实验设置中始终优于基线架构，适合大规模现实生物多样性监测。

Abstract: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary faces
extreme challenges: calls span low-frequency moans to ultrasonic clicks, often
overlap, and are embedded in variable anthropogenic and environmental noise. We
introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments
spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then
fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification.
Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the
model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context.
Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research
Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and
mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive
detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal
monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios.
Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of
Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on
spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While
high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD)
setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms
(gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This
robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations
rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its
suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that
in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms
baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both
in-distribution and OOD data.

TL;DR: 提出从语音直接提取信息的语音驱动人脸说话视频生成方法，实验表现优于现有方法，能仅用单语音输入生成高质量高分辨率视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖源图像作外观参考并用源语音生成动作，要解决语音驱动人脸说话的关键挑战。

Method: 先通过语音条件扩散模型结合统计人脸先验和样本自适应加权模块进行语音到人脸肖像生成；再将唇部动作等表情动态嵌入扩散模型隐空间，用区域增强模块优化唇部同步；最后结合预训练Transformer离散码本和图像渲染网络生成高分辨率输出。

Result: 在HDTF、VoxCeleb和AVSpeech数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个仅用单语音输入就能生成高分辨率、高质量说话人脸视频的方法。

Abstract: Unlike existing methods that rely on source images as appearance references
and use source speech to generate motion, this work proposes a novel approach
that directly extracts information from the speech, addressing key challenges
in speech-to-talking face. Specifically, we first employ a speech-to-face
portrait generation stage, utilizing a speech-conditioned diffusion model
combined with statistical facial prior and a sample-adaptive weighting module
to achieve high-quality portrait generation. In the subsequent speech-driven
talking face generation stage, we embed expressive dynamics such as lip
movement, facial expressions, and eye movements into the latent space of the
diffusion model and further optimize lip synchronization using a
region-enhancement module. To generate high-resolution outputs, we integrate a
pre-trained Transformer-based discrete codebook with an image rendering
network, enhancing video frame details in an end-to-end manner. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the
HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Notably, this is the first method
capable of generating high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos
exclusively from a single speech input.

Abstract: The development of synthesis procedures remains a fundamental challenge in
materials discovery, with procedural knowledge scattered across decades of
scientific literature in unstructured formats that are challenging for
systematic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal toolbox that
employs large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to
automatically extract and organize synthesis procedures and performance data
from materials science publications, covering text and figures. We curated 81k
open-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing
synthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes,
structured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The
extraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis
procedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable
LLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source
software library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora
and synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible
infrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable
information. This lays the groundwork for predictive modeling of synthesis
procedures as well as modeling synthesis--structure--property relationships.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在贝叶斯成像科学的无监督模型选择和错误指定检测方面有效，具有低计算成本的优势。

Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.

Method: 基于R3GAN进行系统实验，建立有效训练策略，设计256x256分辨率数据集的优化配置。

Result: 生成样本平衡胚胎数据集后，t3的召回率从0.06提升到0.69，F1分数从0.11提升到0.60，且不影响其他类别。

Conclusion: 定制的R3GAN训练策略能有效缓解小尺度医学成像任务中的数据稀缺问题，提高模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance,
limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications.
Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work
investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for
small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images.
Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training
strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution
datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma
range (5 -> 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced
embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification
performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11
to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results
demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate
data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging
tasks.

Motivation: 提出并比较三种生成3D T1加权MRI人脑图像的DDPMs。

Method: 使用来自42406个受试者的80675个图像体积训练三个DDPMs，对图像进行少量预处理，用分割、Frechet Inception Distance（FID）和定性检查进行评估。

Result: 三个DDPMs都能生成连贯的MR脑体积，速度和流预测模型的FID低于样本预测模型，但三者FID均高于真实图像；生成的脑区域体积分布与真实数据有统计学差异，速度和流预测模型在丘脑和壳核的差异较少。

Conclusion: 提出并发布首个无需颅骨剥离或配准的3D非潜在扩散模型，模型能生成高分辨率3D T1加权脑图像。

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain
images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406
subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had
approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three
human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and
excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the
visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce
images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were
neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected.
Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and
qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent
MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs
than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs
compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment,
the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from
real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer
statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In
conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion
model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the
negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of
generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images. All model weights

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a cutting-edge methodology in statistics
and machine learning, providing prediction intervals with finite-sample
frequentist coverage guarantees. Yet, its interplay with Bayesian statistics,
often criticised for lacking frequentist guarantees, remains underexplored.
Recent work has suggested that conformal prediction can serve to "calibrate"
Bayesian credible sets, thereby imparting frequentist validity and motivating
deeper investigation into frequentist-Bayesian hybrids. We further argue that
Bayesian procedures have the potential to enhance conformal prediction, not
only in terms of more informative intervals, but also for achieving nearly
optimal solutions under a decision-theoretic framework. Thus, the two paradigms
can be jointly used for a principled balance between validity and efficiency.
This work provides a basis for bridging this gap. After surveying existing
ideas, we formalise the Bayesian conformal inference framework, covering
challenging aspects such as statistical efficiency and computational
complexity.

Abstract: Conformal predictive systems are sets of predictive distributions with
theoretical out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The calibration guarantees
are typically that the set of predictions contains a forecast distribution
whose prediction intervals exhibit the correct marginal coverage at all levels.
Conformal predictive systems are constructed using conformity measures that
quantify how well possible outcomes conform with historical data. However,
alternative methods have been proposed to construct predictive systems with
more appealing theoretical properties. We study an approach to construct
predictive systems that we term Residual Distribution Predictive Systems. In
the split conformal setting, this approach nests conformal predictive systems
with a popular class of conformity measures, providing an alternative
perspective on the classical approach. In the full conformal setting, the two
approaches differ, and the new approach has the advantage that it does not rely
on a conformity measure satisfying fairly stringent requirements to ensure that
the predictive system is well-defined; it can readily be implemented alongside
any point-valued regression method to yield predictive systems with
out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The empirical performance of this
approach is assessed using simulated data, where it is found to perform
competitively with conformal predictive systems. However, the new approach
offers considerable scope for implementation with alternative regression
methods.

Method: 引入FermiEval基准评估，采用基于共形预测的方法调整区间，提出直接对数概率提取和分位数调整方法。

Result: 名义99%的区间平均仅65%覆盖真实答案，调整后实现准确99%覆盖，Winkler区间得分降低54%，新方法进一步减少高置信水平下的过度自信。

Conclusion: 提出感知隧道理论解释大语言模型过度自信的原因是推理时忽略分布尾部。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at numerical estimation but struggle to
correctly quantify uncertainty. We study how well LLMs construct confidence
intervals around their own answers and find that they are systematically
overconfident. To evaluate this behavior, we introduce FermiEval, a benchmark
of Fermi-style estimation questions with a rigorous scoring rule for confidence
interval coverage and sharpness. Across several modern models, nominal 99\%
intervals cover the true answer only 65\% of the time on average. With a
conformal prediction based approach that adjusts the intervals, we obtain
accurate 99\% observed coverage, and the Winkler interval score decreases by
54\%. We also propose direct log-probability elicitation and quantile
adjustment methods, which further reduce overconfidence at high confidence
levels. Finally, we develop a perception-tunnel theory explaining why LLMs
exhibit overconfidence: when reasoning under uncertainty, they act as if
sampling from a truncated region of their inferred distribution, neglecting its
tails.

### [238] [How Similar Are Grokipedia and Wikipedia? A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26899)
*Taha Yasseri*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究对Grokipedia和Wikipedia的382对匹配文章进行大规模计算比较，发现Grokipedia语义和风格与Wikipedia相似，但文章更长、词汇多样性低、引用少、结构深度更可变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI驱动的Grokipedia能否摆脱人类编辑平台的偏见和局限。

Method: 对382对匹配文章进行大规模计算比较，使用词汇丰富度、可读性、结构组织、引用密度和语义相似度等指标评估。

Result: Grokipedia与Wikipedia语义和风格强对齐，但文章更长、词汇多样性低、每词引用少、结构深度更可变。

Conclusion: AI生成的百科内容目前反映了Wikipedia的信息范围，但在编辑规范上有差异，倾向于叙事扩展而非基于引用的验证，凸显了自动化文本生成时代知识治理的新矛盾。

Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon
Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural
biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries via the large
language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases
and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study
undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs
between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness,
readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic
similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and
substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and
stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less
lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable
structural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content
currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial
norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The
implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the
governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.

### [239] [Using Salient Object Detection to Identify Manipulative Cookie Banners that Circumvent GDPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26967)
*Riley Grossman,Michael Smith,Cristian Borcea,Yi Chen*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究符合GDPR的cookie横幅包含审美操纵的频率，发现符合标准的横幅中38%存在审美操纵，欧盟网站比非欧盟网站更可能使用审美操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究符合GDPR的cookie横幅包含审美操纵的频率，评估横幅符合GDPR及国家数据保护机构建议的情况，研究用户和网站位置对cookie横幅设计的影响。

Method: 访问2579个网站，识别cookie横幅类型，使用计算机视觉模型进行显著对象检测，访问欧盟和美国IP地址的网站。

Result: 45%的相关网站有完全合规的横幅，38%的合规横幅存在审美操纵，13.9%的欧盟网站在用户来自美国时改变横幅设计，欧盟网站比非欧盟网站使用审美操纵的可能性高约48.3%。

Conclusion: 审美操纵比之前报道的更普遍，欧盟网站对隐私法规有创新响应。

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic
manipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that
permits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate
how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national
data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites
and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the
relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation
on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic
manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to
measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This
enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button
placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common
than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user
and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the
European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,
and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU
and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU
websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU
websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than
non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出SPINE - HT框架，通过三阶段流程使LLM推理能力应用于异构机器人团队，在模拟和现实实验中均取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的异构机器人团队方法假定环境结构良好且已知，限制了在非结构化环境中的部署，需要解决此问题。

Method: 提出SPINE - HT框架，通过三阶段流程将LLM推理能力应用于异构机器人团队，包括生成、验证子任务，根据能力分配子任务并根据在线反馈优化。

Result: 模拟实验中成功率近两倍于先前方法，现实实验成功率达87%。

Conclusion: SPINE - HT框架有效解决了现有方法在非结构化环境部署的局限性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

TL;DR: 提出神经符号验证器RepV，统一形式方法和深度学习方法，在潜在空间验证计划合规性，提升预测准确性，代码数据公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统行动规则验证方法存在局限性，形式方法需手工规范、表达和易用性有限，深度学习方法决策不透明易误分类。

Method: 从模型检查器标记的计划种子集开始，训练轻量级投影器将计划和语言模型生成的理由嵌入低维空间，用线性边界验证。

Result: 相比基线方法，合规预测准确率最多提升15%，参数增加少于0.2M，细化框架在多规划领域表现优于普通微调基线。

Conclusion: 安全可分离的潜在空间为可靠的神经符号计划验证提供了可扩展、即插即用的原语。

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

Result: VOPP实现无依赖和同步瓶颈的大规模并行求解，计算近最优解效率比现有并行在线求解器至少高20倍

Conclusion: VOPP有效解决了POMDP求解器并行化难题，提高了计算效率

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

Method: 提出Dynamics - Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP)，在动作生成时让策略和动力学模型提供相互纠正反馈。

Result: 在实际机器人操作任务上泛化性能优于基线方法，在包括视觉干扰和光照变化等OOD场景中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAP方法有效，能提高机器人操作任务的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
visual distractions and lighting variations.

Method: 引入SoftAE框架，用概率集成模型估计认知不确定性，主动引导探索状态 - 动作空间。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实软机器人平台上，相比随机探索和基于任务特定模型的强化学习，SoftAE模型更准确，零样本控制表现好，且有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的主动探索可产生可扩展、可复用的动力学模型，推动软机器人控制发展。

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式策略存在高计算成本、暴露偏差和不稳定推理动态等问题，基于能量的模型虽有改进但难扩展，EBT潜力待挖掘。

Method: 引入新的基于能量的架构EBT - Policy。

Result: 在模拟和现实任务中，EBT - Policy表现优于扩散策略，计算量小，部分任务收敛步数大幅减少，有零样本恢复等新能力。

Conclusion: EBT - Policy为分布偏移下的鲁棒、通用机器人行为提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 现有方法无法应对超密集LEO星座网络环境，提出PRIMAL框架，模拟验证其在优化延迟和负载均衡上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超密集LEO星座网络环境复杂，现有路由算法无法满足异步、风险感知等需求。

Method: 引入PRIMAL事件驱动的多智能体路由框架，通过原始对偶方法管理性能下降风险，让智能体学习目标QoS目标的全成本分布并约束尾端风险。

Result: 在1584颗卫星的LEO星座上模拟，相比无风险感知基线，降低排队延迟超70%，满载场景端到端延迟减少近12ms。

Conclusion: 自主风险感知是实现稳健路由的关键。

Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous
network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and
significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing
algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse
and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However,
existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on
impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To
tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing
framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on
its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case
performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved
by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS
objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO
constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively
optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious
baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms
end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by
resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion
avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust
routing.

Abstract: Feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) explain individual predictions

propose Modules of Influence (MoI), a framework that (i) constructs a model
explanation graph from per-instance attributions, (ii) applies community
detection to find feature modules that jointly affect predictions, and (iii)
quantifies how these modules relate to bias, redundancy, and causality
patterns. Across synthetic and real datasets, MoI uncovers correlated feature
groups, improves model debugging via module-level ablations, and localizes bias
exposure to specific modules. We release stability and synergy metrics, a
reference implementation, and evaluation protocols to benchmark module
discovery in XAI.

Abstract: We pay our attention towards secure and robust communication in the presence
of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced mobile eavesdropping
attacker in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)wireless
networks.Specifically,we first provide a unifying framework that generalizes
specific intelligent wiretap model wherein the passive eavesdropper configured
with any number of antennas is potentially mobile and can actively optimize its
received signal strength with the help of RIS by intelligently manipulating
wiretap channel characteristics.To effectively mitigate this intractable
threat,we then propose a novel and lightweight secure communication scheme from
the perspective of information theory.The main idea is that the data processing
can in some cases be observed as communication channel,and a random
bit-flipping scheme is then carefully involved for the legitimate transmitter
to minimize the mutual information between the secret message and the passive
eavesdropper's received data.The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based
precoding strategy is also implemented to optimize power allocation,and thus
ensure that the legitimate receiver is not subject to interference from this
random bit-flipping.The corresponding results depict that our secure
communication scheme is practically desired, which does not require any a prior
knowledge of the eavesdropper's full instantaneous Channel State Information
(ICSI). Furthermore,we consider the RIS optimization problem from the
eavesdropper's perspective,and provide RIS phase shift design solutions under
different attacking scenarios.Finally,the optimal detection schemes
respectively for the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are provided,and
comprehensive simulations are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and
show the effectiveness and robustness of our secure communication scheme across

Abstract: From the perspective of hard decision fusion, we investigate Byzantine
attacks in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for mobile
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in this paper. Specially, a RIS-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under
dynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and
attack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal
channel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both
small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results
depict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge
of the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm
probability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although
perfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker
perspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward
relays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that
leads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also
indicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion
rule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying
framework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking
effectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes
rather than the channel dynamics. That is, to make the channel-aware approach
more practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and
decision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully
relaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through
extensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios.

TL;DR: 传统在线调查个性化不足，多数AI调查聊天机器人适应性差，AURA框架用强化学习解决问题，评估显示其提升了响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统在线调查和多数AI调查聊天机器人个性化与适应性不足，响应质量低的问题。

Method: 提出AURA框架，用LSDE指标量化响应质量，通过epsilon - greedy策略选择后续问题类型，结合先验数据动态适应参与者。

Result: AURA响应质量平均提升0.12，相比非自适应基线有显著改进，特定提示减少63%，验证行为增加10倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习可提升调查聊天机器人适应性，将静态问卷转变为交互式、自我改进的评估系统。

Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting
in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots
improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees
or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit
individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.
We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through
Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for
AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality
using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and
Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy
that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with
priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total
chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation
across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual
participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12
mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over
non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in
specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results
demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved
adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving
assessment systems.

Abstract: Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human
communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into
linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely
focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary
neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding
unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals
derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural
communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study
investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences
across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted
from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and
in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the
properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction
and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more
effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the
feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for
reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward
developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse
patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful
insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions
utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准辐射传输计算方法计算量大且存在精度 - 速度权衡，在大型模型中会降低模拟精度，而辐射传输计算适合用机器学习模拟。

Method: 使用仅编码器的变压器神经网络架构，在代表太阳成分热木星大气的一维剖面数据上训练辐射传输模拟器。

Result: 模拟器重现的双流层通量与传统方法相比，测试集平均误差约 1%，速度提升 100 倍。

Conclusion: 用机器学习模拟辐射传输为行星大气模型提供了更快更准确的计算途径。

Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary
atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose
accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical
simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade
the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal
candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined
physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and
high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.
We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer
neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of
solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric
two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the
traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer
with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate
routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

Result: 在中纬度热浪案例中，以30 - 300倍的低成本生成了可靠的极端天气统计数据和相关动力学。

Conclusion: AI+RES算法是研究气候科学及其他领域极端事件的强大可扩展工具。

Abstract: Assessing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and
understanding how climate change affects them, is crucial for developing
effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, observational datasets
are too short and physics-based global climate models (GCMs) are too
computationally expensive to obtain robust statistics for the rarest, yet most
impactful, extreme events. AI-based emulators have shown promise for
predictions at weather and even climate timescales, but they struggle on
extreme events with few or no examples in their training dataset. Rare event
sampling (RES) algorithms have previously demonstrated success for some extreme
events, but their performance depends critically on a hard-to-identify "score
function", which guides efficient sampling by a GCM. Here, we develop a novel
algorithm, AI+RES, which uses ensemble forecasts of an AI weather emulator as
the score function to guide highly efficient resampling of the GCM and generate
robust (physics-based) extreme weather statistics and associated dynamics at
30-300x lower cost. We demonstrate AI+RES on mid-latitude heatwaves, a
challenging test case requiring a score function with predictive skill many
days in advance. AI+RES, which synergistically integrates AI, RES, and GCMs,
offers a powerful, scalable tool for studying extreme events in climate
science, as well as other disciplines in science and engineering where rare
events and AI emulators are active areas of research.

Method: 分析2023年1月 - 2024年1月的21,540,921次火灾探测数据，运用机器学习逆向工程、自举模拟和时空分析等方法。

Result: 夜间无低置信度分类，此模式全球、全月、全纬度带及两颗卫星均存在，是算法约束而非地球物理现象，影响27.9%的火灾探测。

Conclusion: 建议在VIIRS用户指南中明确记录此算法约束，并对受影响分析采用再处理策略。

Abstract: The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire product is
widely used for global fire monitoring, yet its confidence classification
scheme exhibits an undocumented systematic pattern. Through analysis of
21,540,921 fire detections spanning one year (January 2023 - January 2024), I
demonstrate a complete absence of low-confidence classifications during
nighttime observations. Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as
low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence
(chi-squared = 1,474,795, p < 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally
across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites.
Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation
(1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an
algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon. Brightness
temperature analysis reveals nighttime fires below approximately 295K are
likely excluded entirely rather than flagged as low-confidence, while daytime
fires show normal confidence distributions. This undocumented behavior affects
27.9% of all VIIRS fire detections and has significant implications for fire
risk assessment, day-night detection comparisons, confidence-weighted analyses,
and any research treating confidence levels as uncertainty metrics. I recommend
explicit documentation of this algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and
reprocessing strategies for affected analyses.

Method: 采用离线上下文多臂老虎机方法，通过最小化Magni葡萄糖风险 - 回报函数，使用混合动作Soft Actor - Critic算法训练模型，将任务视为单步上下文多臂老虎机。

Result: 模型能从横断面NHANES数据生成风险感知的生活方式医学处方。

Conclusion: 该方法值得进行前瞻性临床验证。

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment can benefit from personalized
lifestyle prescriptions. However, the delivery of personalized lifestyle
medicine prescriptions is limited by the shortage of trained professionals and
the variability in physicians' expertise. We propose an offline contextual
bandit approach that learns individualized lifestyle prescriptions from the
aggregated NHANES profiles of 119,555 participants by minimizing the Magni
glucose risk-reward function. The model encodes patient status and generates
lifestyle medicine prescriptions, which are trained using a mixed-action Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm. The task is treated as a single-step contextual bandit.
The model is validated against lifestyle medicine prescriptions issued by three
certified physicians from Xiangya Hospital. These results demonstrate that
offline mixed-action SAC can generate risk-aware lifestyle medicine
prescriptions from cross-sectional NHANES data, warranting prospective clinical
validation.

Motivation: 77项的ATEC评估清单让护理人员觉得负担重，限制了常规监测的使用，因此需缩短评估时间并保持准确性。

Method: 利用60名接受治疗的自闭症儿童的纵向ATEC数据，应用特征选择和交叉验证技术，针对纵向治疗跟踪和即时严重程度评估两个目标确定最具预测性的项目。

Conclusion: 该框架具有广泛适用性，可实现更便捷、频繁和可扩展的评估，为神经发育和精神疾病背景下的人工智能支持干预提供数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often find the
77-item Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) burdensome, limiting its
use for routine monitoring. This study introduces a generalizable machine
learning framework that seeks to shorten assessments while maintaining
evaluative accuracy. Using longitudinal ATEC data from 60 autistic children
receiving therapy, we applied feature selection and cross-validation techniques
to identify the most predictive items across two assessment goals: longitudinal
therapy tracking and point-in-time severity estimation. For progress
monitoring, the framework identified 16 items (21% of the original
questionnaire) that retained strong correlation with total score change and
full subdomain coverage. We also generated smaller subsets (1-7 items) for
efficient approximations. For point-in-time severity assessment, our model
achieved over 80% classification accuracy using just 13 items (17% of the
original set). While demonstrated on ATEC, the methodology-based on subset
optimization, model interpretability, and statistical rigor-is broadly
applicable to other high-dimensional psychometric tools. The resulting
framework could potentially enable more accessible, frequent, and scalable
assessments and offer a data-driven approach for AI-supported interventions
across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric contexts.

Method: 以胰岛素样生长因子1（IGF - 1）测量值为测试案例，用高斯过程（GP）建模进行基于群体和个体的预测。

Result: 23例训练数据中发现趋势在文献报道值范围内；8例测试案例两种方法个体预测平均均方根误差分别为31.9 (10.1 - 62.3) ng/ml和27.4 (0.02 - 66.1) ng/ml。

Conclusion: GP建模可能克服常规纵向数据局限，便于放疗晚期效应分析。

Abstract: Survivors of childhood cancer need lifelong monitoring for side effects from
radiotherapy. However, longitudinal data from routine monitoring is often
infrequently and irregularly sampled, and subject to inaccuracies. Due to this,
measurements are often studied in isolation, or simple relationships (e.g.,
linear) are used to impute missing timepoints. In this study, we investigated
the potential role of Gaussian Processes (GP) modelling to make
population-based and individual predictions, using insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1) measurements as a test case. With training data of 23 patients with a
median (range) of 4 (1-16) timepoints we identified a trend within the range of
literature reported values. In addition, with 8 test cases, individual
predictions were made with an average root mean squared error of 31.9 (10.1 -
62.3) ng/ml and 27.4 (0.02 - 66.1) ng/ml for two approaches. GP modelling may
overcome limitations of routine longitudinal data and facilitate analysis of
late effects of radiotherapy.

Method: 利用高分辨率SSURGO数据集，对0 - 30厘米根区土壤属性处理，采用结合变分自编码器和KMeans聚类的多元分析分组土壤，用统计指标验证聚类结果。

Result: 确定了10个不同的土壤健康管理区，发现扎根深度限制和饱和导水率是土壤分化主要变量，每个管理区由黏土、有机质、pH值和有效水容量独特组合定义。

Conclusion: 该框架将复杂数据分析与可操作的针对性建议相结合，有助于优化管理实践和提高全州资源效率。

Abstract: Effective soil health management is crucial for sustaining agriculture,
adopting ecosystem resilience, and preserving water quality. However,
Missouri's diverse landscapes limit the effectiveness of broad generalized
management recommendations. The lack of resolution in existing soil grouping
systems necessitates data driven, site specific insights to guide tailored
interventions. To address these critical challenges, a regional soil clustering
framework designed to support precision soil health management strategies
across the state. The methodology leveraged high resolution SSURGO dataset,
explicitly processing soil properties aggregated across the 0 to 30 cm root
zone. Multivariate analysis incorporating a variational autoencoder and KMeans
clustering was used to group soils with similar properties. The derived
clusters were validated using statistical metrics, including silhouette scores
and checks against existing taxonomic units, to confirm their spatial
coherence. This approach enabled us to delineate soil groups that capture
textures, hydraulic properties, chemical fertility, and biological indicators
unique to Missouri's diverse agroecological regions. The clustering map
identified ten distinct soil health management zones. This alignment of 10
clusters was selected as optimal because it was sufficiently large to capture
inherited soil patterns while remaining manageable for practical statewide
application. Rooting depth limitation and saturated hydraulic conductivity
emerged as principal variables driving soil differentiation. Each management
zone is defined by a unique combination of clay, organic matter, pH, and
available water capacity. This framework bridges sophisticated data analysis
with actionable, site targeted recommendations, enabling conservation planners,
and agronomists to optimize management practices and enhance resource
efficiency statewide.

TL;DR: 本文推导适用于线性系统的自适应控制（AC）公式并应用于综合能源系统（IES）中乙二醇热交换器（GHX）控制，结果显示AC可降低误差，但控制努力大，需进一步研究，同时正开发线性公式的改进方案。

Motivation: IES因缺乏物理理解存在不确定性影响可靠应用，且无统一处理不确定性的方法，AC或可实时处理这些不确定性。

Method: 推导所有状态可观测的线性系统的AC公式，在名义模型四项引入50%误差，用线性二次调节器作为参考系统的名义控制。

Result: 使用AC可将平均绝对误差和积分时间绝对误差降低30%-75%，且计算开销和控制基础设施需求小。

Conclusion: AC在降低误差方面有优势，但控制努力大，需研究其对物理系统的影响，正开发线性公式改进方案应对更多挑战。

Abstract: Integrated energy systems (IES) are complex heterogeneous architectures that
typically encompass power sources, hydrogen electrolyzers, energy storage, and
heat exchangers. This integration is achieved through operating control
strategy optimization. However, the lack of physical understanding as to how
these systems evolve over time introduces uncertainties that hinder reliable
application thereof. Techniques that can accommodate such uncertainties are
fundamental for ensuring proper operation of these systems. Unfortunately, no
unifying methodology exists for accommodating uncertainties in this regard.
That being said, adaptive control (AC) is a discipline that may allow for
accommodating such uncertainties in real-time. In the present work, we derive
an AC formulation for linear systems in which all states are observable and
apply it to the control of a glycol heat exchanger (GHX) in an IES. Based on
prior research in which we quantified the uncertainties of the GHXs system
dynamics, we introduced an error of 50% on four terms of the nominal model. In
the case where a linear quadratic regulator is used as the nominal control for
the reference system, we found that employing AC can reduce the mean absolute
error and integral time absolute error by a factor of 30%-75%. This reduction
is achieved with minimal computing overhead and control infrastructure, thus
underscoring the strength of AC. However, the control effort induced is
significant, therefore warranting further study in order to estimate its impact
on a physical system. To address further challenges, including partially
observable and non-linear dynamics, enhancements of the linear formulation are
currently being developed.

Method: 引入多产品市场，融合组合时钟交换和机器学习技术，迭代机制让消费者按公布价格报告偏好产品包，机器学习辅助价格发现，采用线性定价规则。

Result: 数值模拟显示约15次时钟迭代可收敛到清算价格。

Conclusion: 该多产品市场能解决消费者参与复杂市场的挑战，具有可行性和高效性。

Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) proliferate, future power system will
need new market platforms enabling prosumers to trade various electricity and
grid-support products. However, prosumers often exhibit complex, product
interdependent preferences and face limited cognitive and computational
resources, hindering engagement with complex market structures and bid formats.
We address this challenge by introducing a multi-product market that allows
prosumers to express complex preferences through an intuitive format, by fusing
combinatorial clock exchange and machine learning (ML) techniques. The
iterative mechanism only requires prosumers to report their preferred package
of products at posted prices, eliminating the need for forecasting product
prices or adhering to complex bid formats, while the ML-aided price discovery
speeds up convergence. The linear pricing rule further enhances transparency
and interpretability. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate convergence to
clearing prices in approximately 15 clock iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法扩展到蛋白质 - 肽相互作用存在挑战，如肽的构象灵活性和结构数据有限。

Method: 引入GeoPep框架，利用ESM3进行转移学习，微调其预学习表示，集成参数高效的神经网络架构，使用基于距离的损失函数进行训练。

Result: GeoPep在蛋白质 - 肽结合位点预测中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoPep能有效捕捉稀疏和异质的结合模式，可用于蛋白质 - 肽结合位点预测。

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have
achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However,
extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due
to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited
availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware
models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework
for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3,
a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich
pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited
availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further
integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of
learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained
using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to
enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding
site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding
patterns.

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to
submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years
by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon
emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the
significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate
change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality
forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground
biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the
least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for
accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis
of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning
datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches
SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning
were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable
selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning
approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results
indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,
Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are
important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,
canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy
emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent
tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02
Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across
all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in
estimating total biomass per plot.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation
(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose
underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred
to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides
parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free
process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of
DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for
the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system
renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics
of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed
at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a
reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the
second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred
to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential
measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the
semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised
learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system
as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation
performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic
nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is
used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and
Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The
performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle
filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.
