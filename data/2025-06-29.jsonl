Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents\nprimarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information\ncan be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158\nreal-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed\nsuch that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet\nunrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then\nevaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of\ncontextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without\nviolating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual\nprivacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the\ntime.

Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low."}

To address this, we develop a two-stage\n``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to\nhigh-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV\nregressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by\nextracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping\nit to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based\nindicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of\nheterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across\nasset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets,\ncovering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term\nmean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility\nand illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to\nmarket-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi\ncounterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic,\nmarket-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins. At a\nconceptual level, our study develops a coherent framework for isolating\ndistinct layers of risk in crypto markets. Empirically, it sheds light on how\nreturn sensitivities vary across digital asset categories -- insights that are\nimportant for both portfolio design and regulatory oversight."}

Our study demonstrates DaCe's\ncapabilities by applying its automatic code generation to a critical\ncomputational kernel used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically,\nwe focus on Neko, a Fortran-based solver that employs the spectral-element\nmethod, which relies on small tensor operations. We detail the formulation of\nthis computational kernel using DaCe's Stateful Dataflow Multigraph (SDFG)\nrepresentation and discuss how this approach facilitates high-performance code\ngeneration. Additionally, we outline the workflow for seamlessly integrating\nDaCe's generated code into the Neko solver. Our results highlight the\nportability and performance of the generated code across multiple platforms,\nincluding Nvidia GH200, Nvidia A100, and AMD MI250X GPUs, with competitive\nperformance results. By demonstrating the potential of automatic code\ngeneration, we emphasise the feasibility of using portable solutions to ensure\nthe long-term sustainability of large-scale scientific applications."}

On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values.

However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL\nprotocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in\nage accuracy and identity consistency."}

In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,\nexisting approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate\nspatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional\nnetwork (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)\nclassification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration\nof EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional\nattention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG\nrepresentations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG\nclassifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact\narchitecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI\ndeployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference\ntime, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy\nof 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV\nDataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for\nsubject-specific classification.

To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks.

During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L\noutperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while\nsubstantially saving the computation cost."}

This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark.

Although the static method works great for\nevenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly\nweighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones."}

Object detectors and\nsegmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the\nmodel's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,\nthese confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and\nloss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic\nfoundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to\nquantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not\nmake a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is\ntruly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as\nautomated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this\nwork, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.\nBounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used\nto describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as\nbounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of\nbounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a\nlikelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for\nwhether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of\nperformance."}

This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian\ninvariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson\nequation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct\nefficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators\nunder any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in\nseveral examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models\nwhere we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art\nresults.

Traditional\nmethods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,\nbut struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across\nmodalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple\nembeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more\ndiverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,\nthese set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse\nsupervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize\none-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity\nwithin the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the\nrepresentations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among\nembeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.\nOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k\nwithout relying on external data."}

In response, we introduce\nHalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nhallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual\nreasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual\ninstance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly\nintroduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually\ncoherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art\nvision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations\nare significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often\npersisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual\nreasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity."}
