The proposed approach comprises a\npopulation of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking\nneuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve\ncandidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises\nthrough native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local\ninformation sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.\nWe implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2\nchip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We\ndeploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly\nconsidering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking\nneural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for\nspike-triggered heuristics.

This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios.

Under this model, observed rankings are noisy\nperturbations of a central ranking $\\sigma$, with likelihood decaying\nexponentially in distance from $\\sigma$, i.e, $P (\\pi) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\beta\n\\cdot d(\\pi, \\sigma)\\big),$ where $\\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a\ndistance function.\n  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\\tau$\ndistance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly\nfrom data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for\ninstance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team\nbeating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by\nthis, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance\nmetric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\\alpha$ distances:\n$d_\\alpha(\\pi,\\sigma):=\\sum_{i=1} |\\pi(i)-\\sigma(i)|^\\alpha$.\n  For any $\\alpha\\geq 1$ and $\\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time\nApproximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are\n$\\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution.

This challenge persists due\nto the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their\nreputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,\npotential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber\nincident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to\noptimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven\nmethods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational\nfeatures in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a\nnovel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with\nentity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a\nmultilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident\ntypes (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and\nOthers) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual\nfrequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore\ndependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations\nare observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML\ntechniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by\nInsurTech across ML models.

The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation,\nwhere nodes communicate solely via pulses.

Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role\nin ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current\ndata-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face\nchallenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and\nrobustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a\ncausal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially\ndistributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect\nrelationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph\nprofiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each\noffering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures\nacross time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as\nwater treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early\nwarning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of\nblack-box detectors.

In the core\nof our approach is a polynomial time algorithm for computing planar\nH-modulators. Given a graph class H, a planar H-modulator of a graph G is a set\nX \\subseteq V(G) such that the ``torso'' of X is planar and all connected\ncomponents of G - X belong to H. Here, the torso of X is obtained from G[X] if,\nfor every connected component of G-X, we form a clique out of its neighborhood\non G[X]. We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G\nhas a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various\nH-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by\nH-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By\ncombining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of\nbounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar\ntreewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we\nknow that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar\ntreewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring\nand polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings.\nFurthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes\n(EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u6539\u95ee\u9898\u8c03\u5236\u5668/\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u9762H - \u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eH - \u5e73\u9762\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u89e3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u83b7FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5e73\u9762\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u9762H - \u8c03\u5236\u5668\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49H - \u5e73\u9762\u6811\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cH - \u5e73\u9762\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u82e5H\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cH - \u5e73\u9762\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5339\u914d\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cEPTAS\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u6709\u754c\u6811\u5bbd\u56fe\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce \\emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}\n(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the\nsimplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile\nrewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized\nRL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,\nremoving the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO\nscales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new\ndimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves\ntop performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,\nAlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse\ndatasets and 8B-scale models.

A prominent subset of the workloads in such centers are\nworkflows with interdependent tasks, usually represented as directed acyclic\ngraphs (DAGs). To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from executing such\nworkflows in centers with a mixed (renewable and non-renewable) energy supply,\nit is advisable to move task executions to time intervals with sufficient green\nenergy when possible. To this end, we formalize the above problem as a\nscheduling problem with a given mapping and ordering of the tasks.

The\nstandardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including\nan AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale\nfield trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered\nsignificant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause\nidentification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture\nand the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework\nfor 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation\nwith practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba86G AI\u539f\u751f\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\uff08RAN\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u7ecf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e866G AI\u539f\u751fRAN\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u9700\u4ece\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u878d\u5165AI\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6cdb\u5728AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e2G - 5G\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d226G AI\u539f\u751fRAN\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u539f\u751fRAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5176\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAI\u539f\u751fRAN\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9996\u65e5\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u642d\u5efa\u8d855000\u4e2a5G - A\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73b0\u573a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u652f\u6301\u7684AI\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u7a7a\u53e3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a6G AI\u539f\u751fRAN\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u65e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that\nadapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual\ngradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the\nheavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark\nthe PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and\nKorteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer\nachieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in\nregions with sharp gradients.

Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time.

Many\nof the data problems, such as creating compact data summaries for approximate\nquery processing, can be effectively tackled using concepts from computational\ngeometry, such as $\\varepsilon$-nets. However, these powerful tools have yet to\nbe examined from the perspective of fairness. To fill this research gap, we add\nfairness to classical geometric approximation problems of $\\varepsilon$-net,\n$\\varepsilon$-sample, and geometric hitting set. We introduce and address two\nnotions of group fairness: demographic parity, which requires preserving group\nproportions from the input distribution, and custom-ratios fairness, which\ndemands satisfying arbitrary target ratios. We develop two algorithms to\nenforce fairness: one based on sampling and another on discrepancy theory. The\nsampling-based algorithm is faster and computes a fair $\\varepsilon$-net of\nsize which is only larger by a $\\log(k)$ factor compared to the standard\n(unfair) $\\varepsilon$-net, where $k$ is the number of demographic groups. The\ndiscrepancy-based algorithm is slightly slower (for bounded VC dimension), but\nit computes a smaller fair $\\varepsilon$-net. Notably, we reduce the fair\ngeometric hitting set problem to finding fair $\\varepsilon$-nets. This results\nin a $O(\\log \\mathsf{OPT} \\times \\log k)$ approximation of a fair geometric\nhitting set.

We break down abductive computational\nsystems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for\nfuture research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in\ncomputational systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8fd0\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u90fd\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6bb5\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u63a8\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, these\nmethods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,\nresulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update\nscenarios.

These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable\nto both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated\nthreats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we\npropose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,\nenabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and\nsandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including\nbenign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and\ndefine a policy-driven decision model.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary.

This TV-regularized convex program\non the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy\nobservation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have\nuncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in\norder to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local\npositive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In\npractice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.\nAt the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the\nmodel kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known\nLPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding\nconditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list\nof LPC-kernels, proving that the \"sinc-4\" kernel, used for signal recovery and\nmixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the\nnoise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results\nwhere this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel.\nWe illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant\nmixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques\nto reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528Beurling - LASSO\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fde\u7eed\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6838\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0LPC\u6838\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u5728\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u65f6\u9700\u9010\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6b63\u66f2\u7387\uff08LPC\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u7684LPC\u6838\u5f88\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6838\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u4e0eLPC\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5LPC\u6838\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67a2\u8f74\u6838\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u9650\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u8349\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4eBLASSO\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u201csinc - 4\u201d\u6838\u6ee1\u8db3LPC\u5047\u8bbe\uff1bBLASSO\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u652f\u6301\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6838\u5207\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86LPC\u6838\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two\nsubsets of samples come from the same cluster.

In most previous works, LoRA weight\nmatrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment\npoints. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA\nfine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,\nConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift\nproblem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and\nfine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a\nclosed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and\nfine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during\ninitialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and\ndown matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKrul\u591a\u8f6e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "Krul\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97 - \u52a0\u8f7d\u7ba1\u9053\u6062\u590dKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u6709\u9884\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cKrul\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9996\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c111.5 - 2.68\u500d\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c111.33 - 2.35\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals.

The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance.

Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual\nframes, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across\nvideo sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This\ntemplate-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on\npredefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in\ndynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on\nchallenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling\nocclusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u6a21\u6001\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u975e\u6a21\u6001\u5b8c\u6210\u63a8\u65ad\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u677f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u70b9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8bba\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5047\u8bbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5ba1\u89c6\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u610f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u82e5\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u5219\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u503c\u5f97\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by\nstacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of\nhigh-level representations.

These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes.

To address this, we\npropose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging\nhandcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the\ntumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits\nvolumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ\na promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image\nembeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same\ntumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by\nanatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables\nflexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive\nexperiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that\nradiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE\nprovides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.\nNotably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single\npoint), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical\nscenarios.

However, because of the limited quality and\nquantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle\nto handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,\n\"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s\". Recent works have explored data augmentation\ntechniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable\ntiming-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is\nstill limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled\nT2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled\nlong-form T2A generation, e.g., \"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping\nat 0s-24s\". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time\nwindows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based\non the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and\nAggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent\nComposition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.\nExtensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art\ntiming-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is\ncomparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates\ncomparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and\npaves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

A key challenge in\nlong-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the\ncomposition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across\nrecording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit\nalignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require\ntest-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across\nsessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In\nthis work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural\nTransformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on\nunordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel\ncontext-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers\nunit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording\nsessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows\nfew-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from\nthe test session. To further promote model robustness to population\nvariability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for\niBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We\nevaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,\ncovering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates.

In particular, two types of\nexperiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating\nnew ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,\nmultiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various\nvision models for image classification, object detection, and image\nsegmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDatasetAgent\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5982\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDatasetAgent\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u56db\u4e2a\u914d\u5907\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u6309\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ece\u5934\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e24\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528DatasetAgent\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u63a8\u6d4bDatasetAgent\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance.

Additionally, large-scale DTs\nthat collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,\ncommunication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated\nTwin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT\nsynchronization, and federated meta-learning.

Unlike quantization, pruning,\ndistillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility\nacross model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,\nand compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel\ncompression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a\ndense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a\nlow-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer\noperator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to\nsignificantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive\nexperiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff\nperforms consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,\npost-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can\nachieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance\ndrop without using any fine-tuning data.
