We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix\naddition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer\nscaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for\nboth odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm\nto extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators,\nanalogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our\nHamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula\nand its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian\nsingular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation,\nwhere the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the\nconstructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire\nunit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares\nHamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging\nthe power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In\nparticular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted\nHamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further\nimprovements for initial states with a fixed number of particles.

When this throughput need exceeds the\ncapacity of the machine hosting the structure, one either needs to replace the\nunderlying hardware (an option that is typically not viable and introduces a\nlong down time) or make the data structure distributed. Static partitioning of\nthe data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven\nload distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later\nwill require downtime.\n  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication\nsupport from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion\nof conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation\nwith reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present\nDiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that\ncan be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists\nand (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi\ncontains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the\nunderlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as\nthe client operations.\n  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary\nsearch on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable\nnumber of linked nodes. As a result, we are able to empirically show that DiLi\nperforms as well as the state-of-the-art lock-free concurrent search structures\nthat are based off of a linked list when executed on a single-machine.

Indeed, a prior work of\nthe authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to\narbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum\nstates being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered\nin previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to\nqudits of all $d\\geq 2$.

A cornerstone\nof these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to\ngenerate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the\nconsistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be\nautomated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper\nexplores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and\ninstantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards\nfully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,\nthey are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug\nreports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM\ninvocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and\neconomical.\n  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core\nconcept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing\nplaceholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a\nplaceholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate\npairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This\nequivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure\nsoundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are\ninstantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by\nLLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and\nevaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously\nunknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already\nfixed by the developers."}

A typical example of such a system is a main-memory\ndatabase that provides strong eventual consistency. This problem is important\nand challenging for several reasons: (1) eventual consistency often creates\nanomalies that the users do not anticipate. Hence, frequent checkpoints to\nascertain desired invariants is highly beneficial in their use, and (2)\ntraditional checkpoints lead to significant overhead and/or inconsistencies. By\nshowing that the traditional checkpoint leads to inconsistencies or excessive\noverhead, we define the notion of size-minimal checkpointing for fully\nreplicated databases. We present an algorithm for checkpointing with minimal\ncheckpointing overhead (only O(n) new messages and addition of a single counter\nfor existing messages). It also provides a significant benefit over existing\ncheckpointing algorithms for distributed systems and main-memory databases.\n  A key benefit of DTCS is that it summarizes the computation by a sequence of\nsnapshots that are strongly consistent even though the underlying computation\nis weakly consistent. In essence, when anomalies arise in an eventually\nconsistent system, DTCS enables one to concentrate solely on the snapshots\nsurrounding the time point of the anomaly."}

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal\nbulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.\nFrom the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on\nthe aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be\nobtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite\nElement Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be\ncalculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure\nmodel. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture\nrisk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited\ndue to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient\nspecific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it\ntime consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and\ncomputational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and\nincompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was\nsuccessfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA\nlibrary and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA\nfunctionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static\ndeterminacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately\nthree minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the\nPyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to\nonly a few seconds per case.

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct.

During inference, SDAR generates sequences\nautoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens\nwithin each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive\nexperiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient\nthan masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.\nBuilding on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion\nwith minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel\ngeneration.

While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the\nDavies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical\ngenerator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then\nthe two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a\nlarge class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed\nHamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains\nwithin a constant factor of the classical spectral gap.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL.

This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

A cornerstone\nof these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to\ngenerate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the\nconsistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be\nautomated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper\nexplores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and\ninstantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards\nfully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,\nthey are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug\nreports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM\ninvocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and\neconomical.\n  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core\nconcept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing\nplaceholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a\nplaceholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate\npairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This\nequivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure\nsoundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are\ninstantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by\nLLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and\nevaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously\nunknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already\nfixed by the developers."}

We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the\nfirst framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental\nlearning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate\nsynthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new\ntasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge\ndistillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.\nExperiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff\nconsistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of\n95.8\\%, 94.9\\%, and 94.6\\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7\nmm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and\nanatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets."}

This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight\nto ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing\nto utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely\nrelying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that\nencourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of\ncyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."}

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner).

On ProteinGym (217 mutational\nassays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the\ntraining data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm\nthat within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving\nrobustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the\nHeterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently\nleverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead.

We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation.

Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of\ndistribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,\nconsistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity\nOut of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem\nsetting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD\ngeneralization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal\nrequired solution complexity, either representational (richer solution\nstructure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that\nof all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description\nKolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;\nreasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and\ncompositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

Existing\nFIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or\ncomputationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions\ndetached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer\nLearning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and\nannotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding\nspace. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability\nvia class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),\nyielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering\nand weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that\nachieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly\ndoubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,\nheuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond\nfaces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations\nand subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first\nrecognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm\nstate-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and\nrobustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish\nTransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability\nassessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across\nmodalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and\nscope."}

Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate\n(MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and\nrefine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly\nfocus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using\nLLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token\nlogits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to\nredundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we\nshift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a\nSelf-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of\nself-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to\nadaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence\nagents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate\ncontents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various\nLLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD\ntechniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the\neffectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and\nefficiency of multi-agent debate systems.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,\nwhich can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,\nMySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities.

Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:\nthe \\textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the\n\\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language\ngeneration (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \\textit{input}\ncomponent is particularly critical, while the \\textit{instruction} component\ntends to be concise.

Our results show LLMs overall struggle on\nthe target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,\nwhile the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures\n(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).\nAdditionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank\ncorrelation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each\ntarget structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the\ndifficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline\nsentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two\nexceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across\nboth sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is\nuniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and\nLLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans\nand LLMs."}

Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents.

We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity.

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding\nplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital\nfor next-generation reactor design.

Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often\nemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,\nthey omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena\nneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent\nheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,\n(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent\n3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and\nthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation\ninspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely\nused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy\ncascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three\norders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable.
