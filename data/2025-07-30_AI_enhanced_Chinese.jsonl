The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u751f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SynLang\u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8d23\u4efb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5171\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u751f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165SynLang\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u534f\u8bae\u5b9a\u4e49TRACE\u548cTRACE_FE\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4fe1\u5fc3\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AI\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "SynLang\u4e0e\u5171\u751f\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ea7\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1AI\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We find that\nhierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low\npreprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of\ninputs).

Exploiting random variation in payment\ndates, we find that receiving the transfer in the days preceding the exam\nincreases test scores by 0.01 standard deviations relative to receiving it the\nsubsequent week. Question-level analysis reveals that effects are concentrated\nin final questions and easier questions, suggesting improved cognitive\nendurance and effort allocation. The impacts are largest for recipients of\nlarger transfers, who experience persistent gains in human capital\naccumulation: their college enrollment increases by 0.6 percentage points, with\nhigher graduation and formal employment rates seven years later.

SeRF shows excellent performance for\nrange filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.\nFiltered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the\nlarge-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based\nembeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier\nembeddings.

Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and\ngeneralization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM\narchitectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on\nthe large-scale WikiText-103 task.

Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique\nof both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on\nsemantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to\ndefine operational metrics.

For the same reasons as RankSky, and also to offer directly\nembeddable in DBMS solution, we establish the TOPSIS based CoSky method,\nderived from both information research and multi-criteria analysis. CoSky\nautomatically ponderates normalized attributes using the Gini index, then\ncomputes a score using Salton's cosine toward an ideal point. By coupling\nmultilevel Skyline to dp-idp, RankSky or CoSky, we introduce DeepSky.\nImplementations of dp-idp, RankSky and CoSky are evaluated experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdbdp - idp\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165RankSky\u548cCoSky\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42Skyline\u63d0\u51faDeepSky\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u7684Pareto\u6700\u4f18\u6216Skyline\u70b9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14dp - idp\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u72ec\u7279\u6392\u540d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u52bf\u5c42\u6b21\u6982\u5ff5\u6539\u8fdbdp - idp\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cPageRank\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51faRankSky\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eTOPSIS\u5efa\u7acbCoSky\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42Skyline\u63d0\u51faDeepSky\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9dp - idp\u3001RankSky\u548cCoSky\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u7684Skyline\u70b9\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time\nconsumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent\nservice costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,\nsignificantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it\ndifficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often\nresulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively\ncorrelated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are\nintroduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided\ninitialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial\nsolutions to speed up convergence.

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new\nparadigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native\nmechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged\nto tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of\nLLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,\nillustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,\nand interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.\nLLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate\neffectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external\nknowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven\narchitectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of\nconventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for\nunderstanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the\ntrade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

It requires deep domain\nexpertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs\namong competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving\nrequirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited\ndesign alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across\nvarious SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively\nscarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain\nknowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed\nMAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a\nknowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD\norchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and\nEvaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce\narchitectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation\nreports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative\nexperiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show\nthat MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural\ncomponents and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation\nreports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements\nspecifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability.

BCGSI+P-1S\nand BCGSI+P-2S are therefore recommended as the best choice in practice for\ncomputing an economic QR factorization on distributed memory systems due to\ntheir superior stability when compared to other variants with the same\nsynchronization cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0aBCGSI+P - 1S\u548cBCGSI+P - 2S\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u540c\u6b65BCGS\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4eQR\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cBCGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u540c\u6b65\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5bf9BCGSI+P - 1S\u548cBCGSI+P - 2S\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u540c\u6b65BCGS\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBCGSI+P - 1S\u548cBCGSI+P - 2S\u5206\u522b\u53ef\u8fbe4\u500d\u548c2\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u540c\u540c\u6b65\u6b21\u6570\u53d8\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u597d\uff0cBCGSI+P - 1S\u548cBCGSI+P - 2S\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u6d4eQR\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the\nInternet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating\nvarious forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e94\u7528\uff08IMA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faContextLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cContextGear\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0IMA\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u5404\u79cdIMA\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60IMA\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165ContextGear\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ContextLoRA\u548cContextGear\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cdIMA\uff0cContextLoRA\u548cContextGear\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

This\npaper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution\nshifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change\nbetween train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model\nexperiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of\nnovel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.\nFirst, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method\nfails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously\nperform better in all types of distribution shifts.

Our\nempirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request\narrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for\nco-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix\nintegrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime\nscheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload\ncharacteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors\nand co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization\nand serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation\nshows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by\nup to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over\ntraditional separate setups.

Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two\ncategories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies\ntoo well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which\ncan suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically\nsolvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly\naligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated\non two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI\nsubtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,\nhyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,\nnon-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a\nmore clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of\nrobustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and\nscanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness\nof our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world\nmedical imaging applications.

However, optimizations for\nfitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on\nhistorical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been\nexercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,\nand the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence\nindicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to\npredict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural\nnetworks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually\nimitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions\nthat have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a\nReinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition\nsequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine\nhistorical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path\ntransition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of\nfuzzing.

While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index.

We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language\ncode identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL\ncombinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction\ntypes. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their\nperformance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and\ncode comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before\nfine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after\nfine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,\nsmall fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs\nfine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,\ndemonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.\nAdditionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved\nperformance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model\nperformance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned\nCodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CodeLMs\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08CLBs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1CLCFinder\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7a0b\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728CLB\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1CLCFinder\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6d89\u53ca\u4e09\u79cdPL\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u4e5d\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\u7684CLB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c0313\u4e2aCodeLMs\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709CodeLMs\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0cUniXcoder - base\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684CodeLMs\u5728CLB\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u66f4\u957f\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u9002\u5f53\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eCLB\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cCLBs\u4e0e\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6709\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u3002"}}

In this paradigm, agents interact\ndirectly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on\nbehalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine\ninteraction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital\noperations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this\npaper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the\nAgentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and\nidentify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to\nour framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:\nintelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable\nthe capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and\ncollaboration.

An open question is how systematic this interpretation process\nis. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying\ndifficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for\nverbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to\nwhat degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they\n\"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different\nsizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as\nfine-tuning.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency.

The dataset suffers from egregious\ndata leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws\nthat invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491\ninactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more\nrepeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).\nCritically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test\ncases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.\nStructural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of\nquery ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9.

Among\nthese approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free\nnature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing\ntest-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with\nabundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying\nthese methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while\ndirectly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper\npersonalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we\npropose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to\nstore embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to\nstore class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive\nexperiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte\nachieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only\nnegligible communication and computation costs.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a\npromising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,\nexploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural\ninformation. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information\nto prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only\non LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,\ntext-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:\nmulti-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to\nrapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information.

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments.

However, the lack of\nreliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and\nsuperior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the\nstrengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural\nnetwork extended corresponding state model to predict the residual\nthermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is\nthat the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular\nstructures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized\ndesign of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The\nproposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known\nfluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method.

In this work, inspired by\nthe remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the\nfirst mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,\ngrounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction.

This paper\npresents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,\ncombining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning\ncapabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs\ndirectly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an\nexternal component.

We also\npropose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic\nmodels.\n  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct\nproblems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective\nclassification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label\npatterns, substantially improving accuracy.

The\nproposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input\nsignal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer\nalongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nrespiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,\nexperiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly\noptimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger\ncounterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both\nshort-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby\nenhancing the model's representational capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u547c\u5438\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u548c\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u75bc\u75db\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u547c\u5438\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u75bc\u75db\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u75bc\u75db\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u75db\u82e6\u548c\u9884\u9632\u529f\u80fd\u8870\u9000\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u547c\u5438\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u548c\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u547c\u5438\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u75bc\u75db\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u5e38\u8d85\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u75bc\u75db\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop\nto several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period\nsystems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory\nmanagement, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL\napproach learns policies across products using only historical information that\nwould be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand\ndistributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our\ngeneric DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms\nestablished benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while\nrequiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned\npolicies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known\nstructural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations\nresearch methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,\nwe propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly\nincorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the\nlearning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to\nthe policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with\nrealistic demand data.

Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B\nparameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while\nachieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and\nquantization techniques in the same compression ratio.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u8c03LLAVA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u526a\u679d\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b07B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u57284GB VRAM\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u526a\u679d\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u526a\u679d - SFT - \u91cf\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u57284GB VRAM\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1170%\uff0c\u76f8\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u6027\u80fd\u9ad84%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

Experiments across 23\nreal-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global\nbaselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\\%, and 12 local\nbaselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and\nADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\\%, establishing its robustness for\nonline multi-label classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6iHOMER\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u91cf\u5212\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8f93\u51fa\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165iHOMER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eJaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u88c2 - \u805a\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u5143Bernoulli\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6811\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u572823\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0ciHOMER\u6bd45\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u9ad823%\uff0c\u6bd412\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u9ad832%\u3002", "conclusion": "iHOMER\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its\nintuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level\nfeature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull\"). The system leverages\nimage-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision\nmodels to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and\ntechnical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated\nvisualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration.

While prior work has\nlargely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often\nneglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,\nwe first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA\nPrinciples of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and\nthe CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTrident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,\nfinancial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and\ndomain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals\nkey safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic\nexpectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle\nethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained\ndomain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work\nprovides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law\nand finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the\nsafety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields.

However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models\nfor physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse\ndatasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a\nmultimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and\nclinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both\nnormal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using\nsynchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes\nraw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body\nkinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,\nenabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and\nreference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also\nprovide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate\nsystems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools\nfor visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed\nannotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations\nsupport diverse analysis goals.

Most existing\ndefense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the\nmodel's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of\nmalicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense\nframework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's\nreliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed\ntrigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely\nmatching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on\nmodel outputs.

In the adaptive setting, where the\nadversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight\nthe importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and\npropose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference\nAttack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional\nshadow training to boost membership inference performance.\n  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training\nshadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy\nMembership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy\nthat identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses\ntheir behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test\nfor membership inference.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse\nmultiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation\nfrom the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide\ndeterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent\nambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane\nmarkings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages\nthe diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized\nmaps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,\nMapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a\nBEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows\naggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty\nestimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in\nsingle-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples\nconsistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit\nof distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are\nsignificantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying\nregions with ambiguous sensor input.

This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel\nsecurity risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can\ncascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent\ntrust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability\nScoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous\nto Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In\nan ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to\ncascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust\nits outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key\nvariables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),\ncapturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.\nWe then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,\nand inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic\nAI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we\nargue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking\nframeworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.\nWe outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using\narchitectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust\nfailures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized\nagent-to-agent security evaluation.

Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,\nit has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The\nrapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,\nmachine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the\nforefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness.

We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities\nthrough several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a\nnovel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss\nterms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples\ninclude optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target\ntrajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to\nemulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation\nthrough hundreds of full simulation steps.

To address feature\nmismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to\nalign second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.\nExtensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland\ntestbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the\nnumber of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean\nabsolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u63ba\u94d2\u5149\u7ea4\u653e\u5927\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u63ba\u94d2\u5149\u7ea4\u653e\u5927\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u8c31\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u53d1\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u768426\u4e2a\u63ba\u94d2\u5149\u7ea4\u653e\u5927\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63ba\u94d2\u5149\u7ea4\u653e\u5927\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is\neasily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language\nthat can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we\nhypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced\nthe generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN\ndistribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions\nover these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us\nto quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to\ngenerate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for\nseveral state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk\nillustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare\nthese models along the dimension of explainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eHMLNs\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91caDNN\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e76\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91caDNN\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6df1\u5165\u6d1e\u5bdf\u8fd9\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eHMLNs\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684HMLN\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u63a8\u65ad\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Preliminary report. Feedback welcome!", "summary": "In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a\ntransformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)\ngame. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an\nagent must collect \"coins\" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of\n\"spotlights.\" By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth\ntransform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space\nfor our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better\nmodeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to\npoint. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general\nvolume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry\nout an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent\nrepresentation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while\nfollowing a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the\nagent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the\nenvironmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear).

As a time-domain\ntechnique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given\nduration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time\ncan be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down\nmore radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably\nthe packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is\nallowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally\nbalance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic\nmaximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of\nservice (QoS) is minimized.

Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward\nfunction, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but\ndiscontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always\ntries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network\nand traffic conditions.

To address\nthis security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection\nframework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series\nmodeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts\neach window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in\nthe timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes\nadvantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into\nsequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal\nanomaly patterns across the graphs.

Consequently,\ntraining-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a\npopular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the\ndenoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution\ngeneration. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,\nwhich we call ``patch-level distribution shift\" and ``increased patch\nmonotonicity.\" To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),\na framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions\nremain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with\nthe patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined\ndetails in high-resolution images.

Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate\nthe functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically\nanalyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art\ndetection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable\ndetection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes\n(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers.

Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance.

We implement a systematic experimental framework\ninvolving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.\nThese configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting\nvs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.\nChain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data\ndictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,\nand evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and\nmodel complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and\nbehaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by\nstructured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to\nproduce meaningful specifications.

To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation.

We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification.

These synthetic preferences are\nthen used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,\nsimilar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally\ncurated rewards.\n  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --\nrestoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step\nreasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and\nmultiple-choice question answering.\n  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms\nreinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and\ndata-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further\nresearch in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRLSF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4f5c\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f3c\u662f\u800c\u975e\u4f46\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u540e\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "RLSF\u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u3002"}}

Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate\nmeaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point\ncloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and\nlaptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate\nexplanations for the working of classification models.

In contrast to previous methods,\nthe segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily\ninterpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over\nother methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker.
