Meanwhile, even simple analytics\nqueries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast\ndifferences in both performance and cost among plans.\n  This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics\npipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine.\nOdyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing\nstate space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify\nPareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even\nfor complex queries.

Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\\beta\n\\in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the\ncorrelation parameter $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between\ninstitutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of\ndisadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this\nsetting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same\ninstitution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a\nclosed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio.

The goal is to\nfind a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,\ni.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We\ngeneralize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show\nthat ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which\nwe call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any\narbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its\ntransition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward\nfunctions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and\napproximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,\nand thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard\nPOMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting."}

Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a\nframework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution\nover the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in\nany Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the\ncomplexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand\nhow certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output\nspace. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in\nuncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is\nthat GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often\nrely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,\nsuch that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified\nGP.

Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated\nfour versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case.

Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into\nproduction outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,\ndesigning effective alerts is challenging.

On top of this,\nalerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and\ntherefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry\npractitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as\napplication code.

Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies.

Thus, unified models that operate\nseamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across\nembodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large\nModel (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves\ninstruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and\nsupports robust cross-embodiment control.

We then\ninstantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of\nagents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an\nexisting approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;\n(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)\nfrom external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,\nextending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of\narguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two\nstandard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with\ntwo or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that\ncombining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in\nthe case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of\nevidence for claim verification."}

Built on a state space\nbackbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information\npropagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and\nMoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the\nbest-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a\n27% improvement on the LD50 task.

In this paper, we establish a theoretical\nframework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.\nStarting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation\nof the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we\nderive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is\nrelated to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and\nis approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and\na variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling\nstochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we\nobtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this\ntheoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which\nestimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target\ndomain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final\naccuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,\nmore stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small\ninitialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon\npublication."}

In many of the current methods,\ntrying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a\nparticular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other\nelements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to\nunintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps\nto address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene\nDescriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we\nintroduce the \"Neural Universal Scene Descriptor\" or Neural USD. In this\nframework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical\nmanner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific\nconstraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and\npose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above\ncontrol signals are disentangled from one another.

However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,\nuser-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for\nthe complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we\nintroduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly\nDetection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find\nnovelties.\n  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different\ngeometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance\nmetrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score\nthat is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this\nmulti-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery\non astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.\nRubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the\nZwicky Transient Facility.\n  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --\nanomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other\nstate-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes\ndiscovered.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations.

These VEs\naccelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV\nsensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight\nsafety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme\nthat integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the\ntwin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous\ntrajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring\nobstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach\nachieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission\ncompletion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and\nefficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments."}

To address\nthis, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire\nsequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of\nthe predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm\nthat extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video\ngeneration.

However,\nthe binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable\ninformation loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this\nissue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both\nlow-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the\nperformance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental\nresults with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level\nspiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a\nreduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on\nimage classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to\n3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization\nintervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce\nthe inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor\nof 10 compared to previously published results.

A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model.

While humans intuitively perform this translation based on\ncommon sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper\nintroduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate\nsemantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios\nfrom four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,\nand Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,\nGemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against\nannotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while\ntop-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition\ncapabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial\nunderstanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across\ngames, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples\nsubstantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted\nenhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities.

It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a\nlow-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal\nactively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations\ndegrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,\nimplying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining\nobjective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and\nhighlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges\nnaturally in a connectionist system."}
