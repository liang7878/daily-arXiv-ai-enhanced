While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive\ndatasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail\nto capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation\npolicies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced\nActor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates\ndiffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user\npreferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of\ndiffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and\nincorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle\nsuboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling\nstrategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more\ntargeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec\nthrough extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an\nonline simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term\nuser preferences.

Prior works have focused on leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their\nreasoning capabilities could likewise help. This raises a key question: Can\nexplicit reasoning benefit GR? To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary\nstudy where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning before performing constrained docid decoding. Although this method\noutperforms standard GR, the generated reasoning tends to be verbose and poorly\naligned with the docid space. These limitations motivate the development of a\nreasoning mechanism better tailored to GR.\n  Therefore, we propose Reason-for-Retrieval (R4R), a reasoning-augmented\nframework for GR that converts free-form CoT reasoning into a compact,\nstructured format, and iteratively refines the reasoning during the retrieval\nprocess. R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable\nLLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR. At inference time, R4R first uses\nthe LLM to generate an initial structured reasoning; then the same LLM\nalternates between (i) constrained decoding with the chosen GR method to\nproduce candidate docids and (ii) updating the reasoning based on retrieval\nresults to improve the next round. R4R does not require additional models or\ntraining, and instead a single LLM serves as both the reasoning generator and\nthe retriever.

In this problem, the input is an $n$-vertex graph $G$ whose\nvertices are partitioned into two independent sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, and a\nnon-negative integer $k$. The question is whether $G$ admits a 2-layered\ndrawing with at most $k$ crossings, where each $V_i$ lies on a distinct line\nparallel to the $x$-axis, and all edges are straight lines. We resolve this\nopen question by giving the first subexponential fixed-parameter algorithm for\nthis problem, running in time $2^{O(\\sqrt{k}\\log k)} + n \\cdot k^{O(1)}$.\n  We then ask whether the subexponential phenomenon extends beyond two layers.\nIn the general $h$-Layer Crossing Minimization problem, the vertex set is\npartitioned into $h$ independent sets $V_1, \\ldots, V_h$, and the goal is to\ndecide whether an $h$-layered drawing with at most $k$ crossings exists. We\npresent a subexponential FPT algorithm for three layers with running time\n$2^{O(k^{2/3}\\log k)} + n \\cdot k^{O(1)}$ for $h = 3$ layers.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that\nenables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic\nsearch complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our\napproach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus\ninto a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a\ntop-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online\ntraversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree.

While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its\nprohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches\npromise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen\nprograms. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler\nauto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization.

Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a\ncoreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to\nunseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset\nsequence and refines it using lightweight techniques.

Second, most RAG\nevaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs\nand retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we\npropose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level\ntemporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped\nrelations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries\nare generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends\nat that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new\ntemporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing\ngraph.

Although envy-freeness has emerged as the\narchetypal fairness notion, envy-free (EF) allocations need not exist with\nindivisible items. To bypass this, a prominent line of research demonstrates\nthat there exist allocations that can be made envy-free by allowing a subsidy.\nExtensive work in the offline setting has focused on finding such envy-freeable\nallocations with bounded subsidy. We extend this literature to an online\nsetting where items arrive one at a time and must be immediately and\nirrevocably allocated. Our contributions are two-fold:\n  1. Maintaining EF Online: We show that envy-freeability cannot always be\npreserved online when the valuations are submodular or supermodular, even with\nbinary marginals. In contrast, we design online algorithms that maintain\nenvy-freeability at every step for the class of additive valuations, and for\nits superclasses including $k$-demand and SPLC valuations.\n  2. Ensuring Low Subsidy: We investigate the quantity of subsidy required to\nguarantee envy-freeness online. Surprisingly, even for additive valuations, the\nminimum subsidy may be as large as $\\Omega(mn)$, in contrast to the offline\nsetting, where the bound is $O(n)$. On the positive side, we identify valuation\nclasses where the minimum subsidy is small (i.e., does not depend on $m$),\nincluding $k$-valued, rank-one, restricted additive, and identical valuations,\nand we obtain (mostly) tight subsidy bounds for these classes."}

Quantization is\nfundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp\nutilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit\nwidth of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational\npower required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP\nquantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due\nto quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of\nBFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP\nvariants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible\nBlock FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically\nswitch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication\n(MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD\nKria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based\nCPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per\nsecond (~3.9 words per second)."}

Recent\nworks have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the\nspectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their\ndensity estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can\naccurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the\ndiffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in\ncompute- and memory-constrained scenarios.\n  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,\nmotivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.\nMoreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also\napproximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent\nLID estimator, FLIPD.

It involves a cooperative game\nmodel where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the\ninput (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based\non these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically\nimpose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired\ngeneration. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode\ncollapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator\nconsistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing\nstudies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,\nlacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit\ncooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and\nidentify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends\nto explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading\nthe system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions\nv.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel\napproach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),\nwhich progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game\nequilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a\nmore optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a\nsuboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and\ntwo synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance\nimprovements over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

This\ntension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:\nconstructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.\nRethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent\nmutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may\ncause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes.

This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each\ncluster and the whole cluster distribution.

Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented\nbody orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high\ncomputational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we\npresent a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete\nequivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete\nequivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete\nscalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and\n2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an\nefficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two\ncommon models: EGNN and TFN.

We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment.

To this end, we train a Transformer\nmodel that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,\nthereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall\nmethodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset\ngeneration of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the\ncorresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to\nensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our\napproach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\\times$\ncompared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances\nwhere competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards\ntransforming the practical scalability of SOS programming."}

We formalize this problem\nand study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark\ndesigned to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning\nability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into\nTextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,\ndevelop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a\nsurrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we\nfind that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative\nrankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of\nleaderboard-driven evaluation.

Gaussian process\n(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from\nscalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often\nneeded for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that\nmodels factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs\nand combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.\nThis design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,\nsubstantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to\nmassive collocation sets.\n  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and\nNewton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating\nleast squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby\nsubstantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical\nguarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof\nand error analysis under standard regularity assumptions.

Recently, MARL\nmodels, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep\nQ-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging\nsequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance\nperformance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in\nwhich agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action\nDecisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which\nagents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence\nof action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and\npredict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a\nTransformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the\nsequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL\narchitecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next\nagent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss\nfunction to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential\ndecision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\nbenchmarks.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce SimKey, a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness\nby tying key generation to the meaning of prior context.

The CES\ndefines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be\nsayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an\nattachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a\nregistry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories,\nemploying the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent\ninter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical\nconstruction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the\nmapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of\n'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is\nformally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to\nbiological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of\nneuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via\nfiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple\nphysiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output\nsystems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble.

Load profiling approaches often rely on\nsummarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the\ncomplexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in\nspecific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative\nmodels, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative\nloads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can\napproximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour\nbetween substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network\noperation, is often overlooked.

Existing approaches require a\nfinite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which\nworks well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class.\nConsequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate\ncoverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become\noverly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid\nprediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into\nour predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new\ndata point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values\ntheoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing\nconnection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of\nobserving a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also\ndevelop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and\ncalibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative\npredictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining\nfinite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and\nreal data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid\ncoverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of\npossible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class\nimbalance."}

While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing\nretrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based\nretrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new\ninformation; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context\nare computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that\nenables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic\nsearch complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our\napproach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus\ninto a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a\ntop-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online\ntraversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in\nsuch LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy,\ncontext-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and\ncross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal\nalgorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM\noutputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our\ntraining-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the\nreasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in\nRecall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline.\nFurthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains\ncomparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation."}

In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator.

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations.

In this\nwork, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues\nby introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next\nframe, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides\nglobal structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame\nsynthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance\nthat jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ\nnoise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness.
