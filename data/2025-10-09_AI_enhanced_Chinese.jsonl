Our\nresults show the continued relevance of imperative process models to\ndata-driven process management, as well as the importance of behavioral\nfootprints and other declarative approaches for integrating model-based and\ndata-driven process management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d41\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u5f25\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c06\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u660e\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u4ecd\u5177\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u8db3\u8ff9\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u547d\u4ee4\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its\ndistributional impacts remain understudied, as does the design of compensatory\ntransit strategies to mitigate potential welfare losses. This study identifies\npopulation segments and regions most affected by congestion pricing, and\nevaluates how welfare losses can be compensated through transit improvements.\nWe estimate joint mode and destination models using aggregated synthetic trips\nin New York and New Jersey and calibrate toll-related parameters with traffic\ncounts reported by the MTA. The results show that the program leads to an\naccessibility-related welfare loss of approximately $240 million per year,\nwhich is considerably lower than the gains from toll revenues: the gross\nrevenue estimated by our models ($1.077 billion per year) and the net revenue\nprojected by the MTA ($450 million per year). However, these benefits gains\nconceal significant disparities. Welfare losses are concentrated in Upper\nManhattan, Brooklyn, and Hudson County, NJ, particularly among travelers less\nable to shift to transit or alternative destinations. For NYC residents,\ncompensating aggregate welfare loss requires a 0.48-minute reduction in transit\nwait time or a $135.59 million annual fare subsidy. Ensuring accessibility\ngains for all populations and counties (Pareto improving) requires a 1-2 minute\nreduction in wait time combined with an annual subsidy of about $100-300\nmillion.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of\na quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of\nproblems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was\nnot known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems --\nqudits -- for all dimensions $d > 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of\nthe authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to\narbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum\nstates being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered\nin previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to\nqudits of all $d\\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based\non Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser\nstate $|\\mathcal{S}\\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate\n$|\\mathcal{S}^\\ast\\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of\nindependent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling\ntechnique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\\geq\n2$:\n  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;\n  2.

Unlike physical goods,\nit is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous\nlicensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call\nfor new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the\nvalue of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players\nbetting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information\nabout past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their\ninformational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed\ncompetitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we\ndetermine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and\nseller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from\ntextbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or\njointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data\nthey hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while\nstill improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not\nnecessarily reduce profit.

A cornerstone\nof these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to\ngenerate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the\nconsistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be\nautomated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper\nexplores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and\ninstantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards\nfully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,\nthey are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug\nreports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM\ninvocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and\neconomical.\n  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core\nconcept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing\nplaceholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a\nplaceholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate\npairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This\nequivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure\nsoundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are\ninstantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by\nLLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and\nevaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously\nunknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already\nfixed by the developers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b040\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u62bd\u8c61\u67e5\u8be2\u6982\u5ff5\u7684Argus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9aa8\u67b6\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528SQL\u7b49\u4ef7\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b040\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c35\u4e2a\u662f\u903b\u8f91\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c36\u4e2a\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c26\u4e2a\u5df2\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

This shift raises a fundamental\nquestion: how do machine agents behave in interdependent environments where\noutcomes depend not only on their own choices but also on the coordinated\nexpectations of peers? To address this question, we study LLM agents in a\ncanonical network-effect game, where economic theory predicts convergence to a\nfulfilled expectation equilibrium (FEE). We design an experimental framework in\nwhich 50 heterogeneous GPT-5-based agents repeatedly interact under\nsystematically varied network-effect strengths, price trajectories, and\ndecision-history lengths. The results reveal that LLM agents systematically\ndiverge from FEE: they underestimate participation at low prices, overestimate\nat high prices, and sustain persistent dispersion. Crucially, the way history\nis structured emerges as a design lever. Simple monotonic histories-where past\noutcomes follow a steady upward or downward trend-help stabilize coordination,\nwhereas nonmonotonic histories amplify divergence and path dependence.\nRegression analyses at the individual level further show that price is the\ndominant driver of deviation, history moderates this effect, and network\neffects amplify contextual distortions.

Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise.

However, the inner decision process of these models\nremains largely unclear, especially as models increase in size. Most\ninterpretability approaches, such as probing, focus on correlational insights\nrather than establishing causal relationships. The paper 'Axiomatic Causal\nInterventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval\nModels' by Chen et al. addresses this gap by introducing a framework for\nactivation patching - a causal interpretability method - in the information\nretrieval domain, offering insights into how neural retrieval models compute\ndocument relevance. The study demonstrates that neural ranking models not only\ncapture term-frequency information, but also that these representations can be\nlocalized to specific components of the model, such as individual attention\nheads or layers. This paper aims to reproduce the findings by Chen et al. and\nto further explore the presence of pre-defined retrieval axioms in neural IR\nmodels. We validate the main claims made by Chen et al., and extend the\nframework to include an additional term-frequency axiom, which states that the\nimpact of increasing query term frequency on document ranking diminishes as the\nfrequency becomes higher.

Improving\ntheir performance is crucial for developing the next-generation efficient and\ncost effective devices. Topology optimization (TO) has emerged as a powerful\ncomputational tool to design LHTES systems by optimally distributing a\nhigh-conductivity material (HCM) and a phase change material (PCM). However,\nconventional TO typically limits to optimizing the geometry for a fixed,\npre-selected materials. This approach does not leverage the large and expanding\ndatabases of novel materials. Consequently, the co-design of material and\ngeometry for LHTES remains a challenge and unexplored.\n  To address this limitation, we present an automated design framework for the\nconcurrent optimization of material choice and topology. A key challenge is the\ndiscrete nature of material selection, which is incompatible with the\ngradient-based methods used for TO. We overcome this by using a data-driven\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) to project discrete material databases for both\nthe HCM and PCM onto continuous and differentiable latent spaces. These\ncontinuous material representations are integrated into an end-to-end\ndifferentiable, transient nonlinear finite-element solver that accounts for\nphase change.

We first show that the general recovery problem is\nNP-hard, ruling out efficient exact algorithms in full generality. To overcome\nthis, we introduce Quantum Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (QOMP), the first\nquantum analogue of the classical OMP greedy algorithm. QOMP combines quantum\nsubroutines for inner product estimation, maximum finding, and block-encoded\nprojections with an error-resetting design that avoids iteration-to-iteration\nerror accumulation. Under standard mutual incoherence and well-conditioned\nsparsity assumptions, QOMP provably recovers the exact support of a $K$-sparse\nstate in polynomial time.

Conducting systematic reviews is laborious,\nespecially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of\npapers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against\ninclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent\nresearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform\ntitle-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.\nWhile LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid\nReviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research,\nwe developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web\napplication running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file\ncontaining paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev\nsupports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual\nscreening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human\nreviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our\nfindings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy\nIncludes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary\ncases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human\nintervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews,\nthey can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of\nscientific literature.

This problem\ngeneralizes Cluster Edge Deletion (the case s = 1) and captures a variety of\ndistance-bounded graph modification tasks.\n  Montecchiani, Ortali, Piselli, and Tappini (Information and Computation,\n2023) showed that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized\nby s plus the treewidth of G, and asked whether the dependence on s is\nnecessary; that is, whether the problem is FPT when parameterized by treewidth\nalone. We resolve this by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard when\nparameterized by pathwidth, and hence by treewidth.\n  On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized\nby neighborhood diversity, twin cover, or cluster vertex deletion number,\nthereby extending to all s >= 1 the results of Italiano, Konstantinidis, and\nPapadopoulos (Algorithmica, 2023), who established FPT algorithms for the case\ns = 1 under the neighborhood diversity and twin cover parameters.\n  From a classical perspective, we prove that the problem is NP-hard on split\ngraphs already for s = 2, complementing the polynomial-time solvability for s =\n1 due to Bonomo, Duran, and Valencia-Pabon (Theoretical Computer Science, 2015)\nand the trivial case s = 3.\n  Finally, while the problem is FPT when parameterized by s + k, its complexity\nfor the solution size k alone remains open. We make progress on this front by\ndesigning an FPT bicriteria approximation algorithm, which runs in time f(k,\n1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} and, for graphs excluding long induced cycles, outputs a\nsolution of size at most k whose connected components have diameter at most (1\n+ epsilon) * s.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76s - Club Cluster Edge Deletion\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6309\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6W[1] - \u96be\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0bFPT\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0aNP - \u96be\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1FPT\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Montecchiani\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fas - Club Cluster Edge Deletion\u95ee\u9898\u6309\u6811\u5bbd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4e3aFPT\u7684\u7591\u95ee\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1FPT\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6309\u8def\u5f84\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6\u4e3aW[1] - \u96be\uff1b\u6309\u90bb\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b6a\u751f\u8986\u76d6\u6216\u7c07\u9876\u70b9\u5220\u9664\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65f6\u4e3aFPT\uff1b\u5206\u88c2\u56fe\u4e0as = 2\u65f6NP - \u96be\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51faFPT\u53cc\u51c6\u5219\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6309\u6811\u5bbd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u662f\u5426\u4e3aFPT\u7684\u7591\u95ee\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u6309\u89e3\u5927\u5c0fk\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal\nbulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.\nFrom the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on\nthe aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be\nobtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite\nElement Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be\ncalculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure\nmodel. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture\nrisk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited\ndue to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient\nspecific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it\ntime consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and\ncomputational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and\nincompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was\nsuccessfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA\nlibrary and the FEA DNN integration framework.

This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct.

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR\nperforms a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained\nautoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,\ndata-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences\nautoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens\nwithin each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive\nexperiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient\nthan masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.\nBuilding on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion\nwith minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel\ngeneration. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures\nconfirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger\nrobustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups\nwithout accuracy loss.

Despite their importance, the proposal process\nis resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially\nwhen proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind\nproposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to\nstreamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study\ninvestigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go\nprogramming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such\noutcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on\n1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes,\nbuild a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs)\nfor predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined\nthan accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of\ndeclined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we\nidentify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited\nuse cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help\ncontributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing\nalternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models\ncan predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with\npartial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort.\nOur findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight\nactionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer\nworkload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their\nproposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76Go\u8bed\u8a00\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u6848\u62d2\u7edd\u591a\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u63d0\u6848\u6d41\u7a0b\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u6613\u4f7f\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u53d7\u632b\uff0c\u63d0\u6848\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Go\u9879\u76ee\u76841091\u4e2a\u63d0\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u6848\u62d2\u7edd\u591a\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u8d85\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u4ec514.7%\u88ab\u62d2\u63d0\u6848\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e5d\u4e2a\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\uff0cGPT\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u62d2\u7edd\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u6848\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u8bca\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

This paradigm introduces\nunique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting\nwith retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our\nanalysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning\nbehaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and\nentropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a\nstrong foundation for RL.

In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a\nnovel framework that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and\nsecure code examples, generates fine-tuning instructions, and instruction-tunes\nLLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We\nevaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two benchmarks: our\nown CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44\nCWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning\ndataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified\nsecurity-critical tasks.

To\nmitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique\nwhich we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances\neach text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting\ncrucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking\nprocess. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks\nshow that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level\nretrieval precision and recall.

This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd2024\u5e74\u4e03\u6708\u9769\u547d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56fd\u5bb6\u66b4\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u800c\u63a8\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u80dc\u5229\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u9769\u547d\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u9053\u5fb7\u51b2\u51fb\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u6ce2\u6548\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5e73\u6c11\u8d77\u4e49\u6210\u529f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5373\u56fd\u5bb6\u66b4\u529b\u672c\u6b32\u5e73\u606f\u5f02\u8bae\u5374\u63a8\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u80dc\u5229\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u5b9a\u6027\u53d9\u4e8b\u63d0\u51fa\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u6297\u8bae\u52bf\u5934\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u9762\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u660e\u5c40\u90e8\u9547\u538b\u56de\u6ce2\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u81f4\u547d\u66b4\u529b\u5f15\u53d1\u5168\u56fd\u52a8\u5458\u4e14\u6548\u5e94\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u65e9\u671f\u56de\u6ce2\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u9053\u5fb7\u51b2\u51fb\u89e6\u53d1\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u6b66\u529b\u662f\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3b\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e03\u6708\u9769\u547d\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u50ac\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u51b2\u51fb\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u5076\u7136\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u6ce2\u6548\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u66b4\u884c\u753b\u9762\u4f20\u64ad\u52a0\u901f\u9769\u547d\u3002"}}

Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the\nrepresentation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar\nexamples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the\nreasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but\noverlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making\nin fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL\nrelies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional\nprototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are\ncritical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional\ndiscrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors.

In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time.

This important\nregime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation\nmodels, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing\nassumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal\nbounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;\nfor more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable\nguarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective\nsample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing\nsingle-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective\nsample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.\n  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in\nmulti-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general\napproach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first\ncontrolling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a\nreduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in\nparameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields\ninstance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set\nof conditions.

Participants articulated their understanding of product\nbehaviour using a structured template and completed matched pre- and\npost-assessments. Of 35 new hires, 31 provided paired records for analysis.\nAcross the full cohort, gains were small and not statistically significant.\nHowever, participants below the median on the pre-test improved by 15\npercentage points on average (statistically significant), while those above the\nmedian regressed slightly (not statistically significant). Course feedback\nindicated high engagement and perceived applicability. These results suggest\nthat short, modelling-focused onboarding interventions can accelerate\ncomprehension for less-prepared new hires.

Vibe check is tied to real-world\nhuman preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right,\nread cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code\nevaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness,\noverlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness.

As a consequence, we\nshow that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussian\nnoise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noise\ndistributions within our class.\n  2. $Q_{\\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\\theta)$ for a general,\nsmooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.\nUsing this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures of\nlinear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, and\nestablish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalized\nlinear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the first\nreduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gap\nin $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al.\n(2016). As a second application, we construct a reduction from the sparse\nrank-1 submatrix model to the planted submatrix model, establishing a pointwise\ncorrespondence between the phase diagrams of the two models that faithfully\npreserves regions of computational hardness and tractability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u751f\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5747\u503c\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u53ca\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6280\u672f\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u7ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c16\u5cf0\u5f20\u91cfPCA\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3k - \u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u4f4d\u6062\u590d\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u731c\u60f3\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement\nlearning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven\nembodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate\nthe capacities for open-endedness and care.ov", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u54f2\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u5b9a\u4e49\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u57f9\u517b\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u6000\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5173\u6000\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u751f\u7269\u751f\u5b58\u4f18\u52bf\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u6d77\u5fb7\u683c\u5c14\u548c\u5c3c\u91c7\u54f2\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57f9\u517b\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u6000\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design\nmitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic\nalterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are\nscalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we\nelevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model\ndiscovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems\nto uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but\nfragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades\nprecipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme\nsensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of\ntool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by\ninducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to\nsatisfice on suboptimal solutions.

In this work, we evaluate whether\nthis architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot\nsuper-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on\nhigher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs.

Extracting\nthese internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to\nextracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,\ncryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been\nactively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely\ndeployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)\nassume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent\nworks (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,\nwhere only the final classification result (e.g., \"dog\" or \"car\") is available\nto the attacker.

(Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that\nmodel extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted\nsetting.\n  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack\nbecome increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,\nsatisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with\nrespect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in\npolynomial time.

We address this gap, clarifying\nthat inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues\nthat compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via\nits in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive\nspecifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness\nfrom Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as\nthe model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We\nempirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack\ntypes, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification\nfollowing on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL\nfinetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical.

Accurate segmentation of FCD\nregions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical\nplanning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to\nthe limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size\nand weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal\ninputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is\noften not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents\na new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt\nstate-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and\nintroduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total\nVariation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and\nreduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

However,\ncatastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge,\nremains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge\ndistillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative\nreplay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective\nfor refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental\nlearning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the\nfirst framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental\nlearning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate\nsynthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new\ntasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge\ndistillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention.\nExperiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff\nconsistently outperforms prior methods.

Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of\nMobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution\nimage editing model running on an A100 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMobilePicasso\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "MobilePicasso\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u907f\u514d\u8fdb\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u7559\u5e73\u94fa\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u534718 - 48%\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u51cf\u5c1114 - 51%\uff1b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe55.8\u500d\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4ec5\u589e\u52a09%\uff1b\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4A100 GPU\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "MobilePicasso\u80fd\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on\nthe Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and\nTransformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,\na new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either\ndo not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point\nEstimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various\nmodel configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three\ndifferent datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time\npipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in\nfront of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is\nbased on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head\npose features.

Radio maps provide a\npromising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI\nacquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction\nrequire location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper\ninvestigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large\ntimescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.\nA hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a\nmobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel.

Although advancements in LLM engineering continue, human-centered\ndesign is still catching up, particularly when it comes to embedding\ntransparency and trust into AI interfaces. This study evaluates user\nexperiences with two distinct AI interfaces - node-tree interfaces and chatbot\ninterfaces - to assess their performance in exploratory, follow-up inquiry,\ndecision-making, and problem-solving tasks. Our design-driven approach\nintroduces a node-tree interface that visually structures AI-generated\nresponses into hierarchically organized, interactive nodes, allowing users to\nnavigate, refine, and follow up on complex information. In a comparative study\nwith n=20 business users, we observed that while the chatbot interface\neffectively supports linear, step-by-step queries, it is the node-tree\ninterface that enhances brainstorming. Quantitative and qualitative findings\nindicate that node-tree interfaces not only improve task performance and\ndecision-making support but also promote higher levels of user trust by\npreserving context. Our findings suggest that adaptive AI interfaces capable of\nswitching between structured visualizations and conversational formats based on\ntask requirements can significantly enhance transparency and user confidence in\nAI-powered systems.

Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,\nThompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the\nstructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by\na measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This\nanswers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances\nexploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to\nstudy and further improve Thompson's original idea.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u94f8\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u201d\u5e73\u7a33\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u89e3\u7b54\u5176\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u8c1c\u56e2\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u7b54\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u94f8\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u201d\u5e73\u7a33\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u628a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e73\u7a33\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u539f\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u6a21\u4eff\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6027\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u53cc\u5217\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u7b54\u4e86\u6c64\u666e\u68ee\u91c7\u6837\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Methods: We developed and fine-tuned Neu-RadBERT, a BERT-based\nmodel, to classify unstructured radiology reports. We extracted all the brain\nimaging reports (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) from\nMIMIC-IV database, performed in patients with ARF. Initial manual labelling was\nperformed on a subset of reports for various brain abnormalities, followed by\nfine-tuning Neu-RadBERT using three strategies: 1) baseline RadBERT, 2)\nNeu-RadBERT with Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining, and 3) Neu-RadBERT\nwith MLM pretraining and oversampling to address data skewness. We compared the\nperformance of this model to Llama-2-13B, an autoregressive LLM. Results: The\nNeu-RadBERT model, particularly with oversampling, demonstrated significant\nimprovements in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline RadBERT for brain\nabnormalities, achieving up to 98.0% accuracy for acute brain injuries.\nLlama-2-13B exhibited relatively lower performance, peaking at 67.5% binary\nclassification accuracy. This result highlights potential limitations of\ncurrent autoregressive LLMs for this specific classification task, though it\nremains possible that larger models or further fine-tuning could improve\nperformance.

While undersampling strategies\ncan accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and\ndegraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing\nhigh-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors;\nhowever, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score\nfunctions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a\npost-processing step.

Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate\n(MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and\nrefine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly\nfocus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using\nLLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token\nlogits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to\nredundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we\nshift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a\nSelf-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of\nself-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to\nadaptively guide the debate process.

Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are\ntrained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using\nstandard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that\nwhile both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the\nmodel trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high\nconfidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved\ncontouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving\nonboard AI for remote sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u8f6e\u5ed3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u536b\u661f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72AI\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6709\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6545\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387L1\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u539f\u59cb\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u548cL1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08YOLOv11s\u548cYOLOX - S\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574AI\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8f6e\u5ed3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u661f\u8f7dAI\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To assess these\ncluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),\nweighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness\n(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a\nspurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts\nand collapse when the cue is removed.

To this end, we use a joint human\nexpert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and\nclosed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for\nstandards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by\nusing it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and\nmore capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a\ntext classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed\nbaselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar\nto human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by\nconducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school\nstudents, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to\nhuman-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\uff08MWPs\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u91cfMWPs\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5b9a\u5236MWPs\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f83\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u9898\u662fK - 12\u6559\u80b2\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u6559\u5e08\u96be\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u7528LLMs\u652f\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6 - LLM\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u5224\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d8511000\u4e2aMWPs\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6559\u5e08\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u768412B\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c30B\u5f00\u653eLLM\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u5c01\u95ed\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684MWPs\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684MWPs\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u504f\u7231\u5b9a\u5236\u7684MWPs\u3002"}}

The\nexisting ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH\nshells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -\nlack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,\nwhich can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,\nMySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using\nunit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful\nprompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having\na 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception\ncapabilities with 89 human attackers.

Our\napproach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce\nmore effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic\nanalyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a\nsupervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality\nembeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes\nembedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment\nthat efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring\ncomplete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration.

We provide evidence that\ncross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment\nacross languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish.\nThis highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls\nof machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language\ndevelopment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5362\u68ee\u5821\u8bed\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5f0a\u7aef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u5362\u68ee\u5821\u8bed\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6587\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u6cd5\u8bed\u548c\u5fb7\u8bed\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5362\u68ee\u5821\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditional\ntesting methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which\nmakes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the\ninability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may\nencounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic\ntesting framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica\nof the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital\ntwin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,\nour approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving\nscenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental\nfeatures, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.\nThe digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes\ncan be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,\nwe define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and\nvehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving\nsimulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and\neffectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1\nscore (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches.

Recent\nadvances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured\nscenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and\neffective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the\npresence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings.

We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and\nfive families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure\nin a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on\nthe target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed,\nwhile the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures\n(93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5).\nAdditionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank\ncorrelation between humans and models increases with parameter count.

These vulnerabilities\nallow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the\npropagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device\nfailures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems\nexhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly\ncomplex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual\nconfiguration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a\nscalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and\nCompute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network\nmodel, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection\nframework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN\narchitecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph\nwith dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security.\nThe core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation\nlearning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier.

These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention\n($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies.

To address this gap, we introduce\nAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and\ninference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set\nof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations\nranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of\n2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,\nsound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio\nlength grows.
