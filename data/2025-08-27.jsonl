This need is especially pronounced with\nAsynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. This communication pattern was not a\nconsideration during the design of the original MPI specification. The MPI\ncommunity has recently introduced several extensions to address these evolving\nrequirements. This work evaluates two such extensions, the Virtual\nCommunication Interface (VCI) and the Continuation extensions, in the context\nof an established AMT runtime HPX. We begin by using an MPI-level\nmicrobenchmark, modeled from HPX's low-level communication mechanism, to\nmeasure the peak performance potential of these extensions. We then integrate\nthem into HPX to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our\nresults show that while these extensions can enhance performance compared to\nstandard MPI, areas for improvement remain. The current continuation proposal\nlimits the maximum multithreaded message rate achievable in the multi-VCI\nsetting. Furthermore, the recommended one-VCI-per-thread mode proves\nineffective in real-world systems due to the attentiveness problem. These\nfindings underscore the importance of improving intra-VCI threading efficiency\nto achieve scalable multithreaded communication and fully realize the benefits\nof recent MPI extensions."}

We operationalized\ncomprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers\nusing neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related\npotentials).\n  We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and\namplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This\nresult suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.\nBased on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to\nidentify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human\nprogrammers."}

However,\naccurately estimating requires data that is not necessarily available or\nmeasured at early stages of reservoir development. We, therefore, applied\nmachine learning (ML), using readily available features, to estimate oil RF for\nten classes defined in this study. To construct the ML models, we applied the\nXGBoost classification algorithm. Classification was chosen because recovery\nfactor is bounded from 0 to 1, much like probability. Three databases were\nmerged, leaving us with four different combinations to first train and test the\nML models and then further evaluate them using an independent database\nincluding unseen data. The cross-validation method with ten folds was applied\non the training datasets to assess the effectiveness of the models. To evaluate\nthe accuracy and reliability of the models, the accuracy, neighborhood\naccuracy, and macro averaged f1 score were determined. Overall, results showed\nthat the XGBoost classification algorithm could estimate the RF class with\nreasonable accuracies as high as 0.49 in the training datasets, 0.34 in the\ntesting datasets and 0.2 in the independent databases used.

We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE\nMapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques.

This paper\nanswers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the\ngates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,\ntropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for\nsymbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;\ne.g. higher-order logic.\n  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit\ninto a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively\nreplacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any\ndigital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no\napproximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no\nreasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons\nin the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's\ncomplexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of\nthe emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade\nalgorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of\nneurons).\n  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating\nshortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped\nTuring machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation\nof randomized Boolean circuits.

The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain\nadaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,\nwhich leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.\nAdditionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.\nOur experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input\narchitecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness\nin unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data."}

To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior\nperformance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets."}

Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM\nusage.\n  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands\nand similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support\nthis activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by\ndesigning collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.\n  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security\nOperations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows\nsupporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for\nexecuting a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment."}

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

This work introduces a novel\ncontext-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal\nevents without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed\nhybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal\ndynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to\nextract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future\nrepresentations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based\nsemantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through\ncontext-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using\nInfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic\nrepresentations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by\nmodulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By\nintegrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system\ncan generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This\nframework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in\nzero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the\naforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data\ngeneration. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data\npreparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,\nobjects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an\nvideo inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all\nobject-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for\nreference-based erasing.

For\nthe tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain\naccuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC\nless than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model\ngeneralized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung\ncohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).\nThe combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung\n(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and\nimproving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that\ndataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi\ncancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust\ngeneralization.

However,\ncollecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often\nlimited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE\n(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion\nmethod that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between\nexisting speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker\nembeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate\nembeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings\nare then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech\nwaveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train\ndownstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded\ndata outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\\% to 5.24\\%\nrelative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker\nverification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,\nwhere it yields a 13.44\\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible\nwith other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable\naddition to existing training pipelines."}

However, most systems remain constrained by a linear\nrequest-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative\ninterfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction."}
