### [1] [Can Media Act as a Soft Regulator of Safe AI Development? A Game Theoretical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02650)

TL;DR: 探讨媒体报道能否促使AI开发者生产安全产品，用演化博弈论研究发现媒体能促进合作但有条件，媒体是有力软监管者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI开发者在利润和用户安全间倾向选利润的问题，研究媒体报道能否推动开发者生产安全产品。

Method: 创建自利的开发者和用户人工群体，通过演化博弈论进行研究。

Result: 媒体能促进开发者和用户间的合作，但在媒体信息质量不可靠、获取媒体或确保安全成本过高时，合作无法达成。

Conclusion: 媒体可塑造公众认知、让开发者负责，是无政府正式监管时引导AI安全的有力软监管者。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of
AI+MPS.

### [3] [Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02722)
*Delong Chen,Theo Moutakanni,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Allen Bolourchi,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出视觉语言世界模型VLWM，在视觉规划任务上表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级世界模型在语义和时间抽象层面理解和推理动作的能力不足，需要有效的规划模型

Method: 在自然视频上训练VLWM，通过迭代LLM自我提炼提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，用批评模型计算成本

Result: VLWM在基准评估和人类评估中达到视觉规划辅助的最优性能，系统2比系统1的Elo得分提高27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上优于强大的VLM基线

Conclusion: VLWM是一种有效的世界模型，在视觉规划任务中表现优秀

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义运算符执行成本高、不适用于交互式任务，深度研究系统未显式优化查询计划，需结合两者优势的运行时。

Method: 构建原型使深度研究代理编写并执行优化的语义运算符程序。

Result: 在两个基本查询上表现优于手工语义运算符程序和开放深度研究系统，F1得分最高提升1.95倍，有成本和运行时间节省。

Conclusion: 构建的原型有效结合了语义运算符和深度研究系统的优势，在性能和效率上有提升。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对大语言模型五个关键模块在自动驾驶运动生成中的应用进行全面评估，实验表明适配后可提升性能并分析相关情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自动驾驶运动生成的应用缺乏对可迁移模块的系统理解。

Method: 在Waymo Sim Agents基准上对五个关键大语言模型模块进行实验。

Result: 适配后模块能显著提升自动驾驶运动生成性能，确定有效迁移技术、分析失败原因及所需适配。

Conclusion: 在Sim Agents任务上评估方法取得有竞争力的结果。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出迭代验证框架优化具身AI任务计划，在多个LLM上表现佳，收敛快，保存人类错误恢复模式，为模仿学习提供高质量数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的具身AI任务计划和人类示范有噪声，降低策略质量。

Method: 提出迭代验证框架，用Judge LLM评判动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，依靠自然语言提示。

Result: 在TEACh数据集上，框架在四个LLM上实现最高90%召回率和100%准确率，收敛快，提高效率和动作组织。

Conclusion: 该方法将计划验证作为可靠的LLM能力，为具身AI模仿学习提供可扩展的高质量训练数据路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域选择超启发式算法主要关注低层次启发式的自适应选择，本文聚焦其集合组成与战略变换。

Method: 基于解接受、低层次启发式重复和扰动强度三个关键原则系统分析变换，用随机选择机制展示变换效果，并将变换应用于多种超启发式算法。

Result: 简单随机选择方法结合合适变换在三个真实世界领域超现有最先进超启发式算法，找到11个新的已知最优解，在CHeSC基准上有竞争力；应用变换的方法在CHeSC基准和真实世界领域超当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 对低层次启发式集合进行战略变换可提升跨域选择超启发式算法性能，常能简化设计。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于采样计划泛化的新符号方法学习策略，可处理大规模问题并测试了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合方法学习策略不能扩展，只能从小训练实例和特征池学习，需要解决可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出基于采样计划泛化的新符号方法，使用 hitting set 算法而非 SAT/ASP。

Result: 分析了方法的形式属性，在多个基准测试中测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 新方法能有效处理包含数百万状态和数十万特征的问题，解决了可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Motivation: 确定自适应探索方法中探索与利用的合适切换时机，这对学习长而复杂动作序列的领域至关重要。

Method: 提出通用自适应探索框架，利用不确定性解决问题，框架可包含之前方法，还能纳入任意不确定性测量机制。

Result: 框架产生的自适应探索策略在多个MuJoCo环境中优于标准策略。

Conclusion: 所提出的通用自适应探索框架能有效解决探索与利用的切换问题，性能表现良好。

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Result: 问责框架使医疗AI系统监管和参与者机制处于统一问责制度下，三层结构指导参与者分类机制。

Conclusion: 医疗AI决策有共同依赖，应共同处理问责，促进协作，强调可解释性对协作的作用。

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Motivation: 改进基于大语言模型的应用生成。

Method: 结合多层验证管道、特定堆栈编排和模型无关架构，在三个参考堆栈上实现。

Result: 综合验证的可行性率达73.3%，30%达到完美质量分数，开放权重模型在结构化环境下达到封闭模型性能的80.8%，框架被社区采用，已生成超3000个应用。

Conclusion: 扩展可靠AI代理需要扩展环境，而非仅扩展模型，为面向生产的代理系统提供实证见解和完整参考实现。

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文聚焦评估大语言模型归纳和溯因推理能力，引入InAbHyD数据集和新评估指标，分析发现模型在简单场景可行，但复杂场景有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数工作仅关注演绎推理，其他类型推理对解决现实问题同样重要且研究较少，因此评估大语言模型归纳和溯因推理能力。

Method: 引入可编程合成数据集InAbHyD，提出基于奥卡姆剃刀的新评估指标，对一些先进大语言模型进行评估和分析。

Result: 大语言模型在简单场景可进行归纳和溯因推理，但面对复杂世界模型和生成高质量假设时存在困难，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等流行技术。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在归纳和溯因推理能力上，简单场景有表现，复杂场景待提升。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Result: 与典型架构相比，方面性智能体AI实现零信息泄露，典型架构信息泄露率达83%。

Conclusion: 专业智能体在自身信息领域高效工作的概念可提升安全性和效率。

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Conclusion: 具身AI系统存在未被充分探索但影响重大的攻击面，物理AI时代急需安全驱动的防御措施。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

Motivation: 弥合大语言模型上下文推理与运动学车道变更模型物理精度之间的差距，实现可解释的车道变更轨迹预测。

Conclusion: SAM - LLM性能与传统LLM相当，在可解释性和资源效率上有显著优势。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Various aspects of the methods of physical and physicochemical modification
of components of filled thermoplastic composite materials are analyzed, aimed
at improving the surface properties of the fillers and the technological
properties of the polymer matrix during their interaction. It is noted that the
improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer
reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for
improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of
research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and

increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The
effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites
in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The
peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy
polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on
the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for
deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium
during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the
improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified
by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well
as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy

TL;DR: 本文提出无训练算法用于大语言模型在线路由场景，有理论保证且实验表现佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型服务需求增加使部署和计算成本高，现有路由方法难适应在线场景。

Method: 利用近似最近邻搜索估计查询特征，对少量初始查询进行一次性优化以学习路由策略。

Result: 理论上算法在自然假设下达到1 - o(1)的竞争比，实验中在三个基准数据集和八个基线模型上，整体性能平均提升3.55倍、成本效率提升1.85倍、吞吐量提升近4.25倍。

Conclusion: 所提无训练算法在大语言模型在线路由场景有效且表现良好。

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型处理大规模文本数据时，顶级模型成本高，经济模型质量低，现有级联框架成本节省有限且理论保证弱。

Method: BARGAIN采用新颖自适应采样策略和统计估计程序，结合数据和任务特征及统计工具进行准确估计。

Result: 在8个真实数据集实验中，BARGAIN比现有技术平均多降低86%成本，输出准确性有更强理论保证，在保证精度或召回率时也有类似效果。

Conclusion: BARGAIN能显著降低数据处理成本，同时在准确性、精度或召回率方面提供强理论保证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or
recall.

TL;DR: 介绍CARPO框架用于上下文感知查询计划优化，实验显示其性能优于PostgreSQL和Lero。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于成本的查询优化器常生成次优计划，现有学习型查询优化器存在一致性和次优性问题。

Method: 引入CARPO框架，采用基于Transformer的模型评估候选计划集，集成包含OOD检测和top - k回退策略的混合决策机制，且可与现有计划嵌入技术集成。

Result: 在TPC - H和STATS基准测试中，CARPO在TPC - H基准上Top - 1率达74.54%（Lero为3.63%），总执行时间降至3719.16 ms（PostgreSQL为22577.87 ms）。

Conclusion: CARPO在查询计划优化方面表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient data processing is increasingly vital, with query optimizers
playing a fundamental role in translating SQL queries into optimal execution
plans. Traditional cost-based optimizers, however, often generate suboptimal
plans due to flawed heuristics and inaccurate cost models, leading to the
emergence of Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs). To address challenges in existing
LQOs, such as the inconsistency and suboptimality inherent in pairwise ranking
methods, we introduce CARPO, a generic framework leveraging listwise
learning-to-rank for context-aware query plan optimization. CARPO distinctively
employs a Transformer-based model for holistic evaluation of candidate plan
sets and integrates a robust hybrid decision mechanism, featuring
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection with a top-$k$ fallback strategy to ensure
reliability. Furthermore, CARPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing plan
embedding techniques, demonstrating strong adaptability. Comprehensive
experiments on TPC-H and STATS benchmarks demonstrate that CARPO significantly
outperforms both native PostgreSQL and Lero, achieving a Top-1 Rate of
\textbf{74.54\%} on the TPC-H benchmark compared to Lero's 3.63\%, and reducing
the total execution time to 3719.16 ms compared to PostgreSQL's 22577.87 ms.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出自适应KV缓存压缩方案GVote，无需手动指定预算，在多基准测试中有效，内存减少2倍且精度相当或更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KV缓存压缩方法存在将不同工作负载强制采用固定压缩比的问题，导致资源分配和推理性能不佳。

Method: 基于重要键是未来查询所需键的聚合这一原理，通过蒙特卡罗式采样潜在查询并聚合选定键来预测未来查询注意力需求，以确定最佳缓存预算。

Result: 在GSM8K、RULER和Longbench等多个基准测试中有效，相比基线内存减少2倍，精度维持较高或相当。

Conclusion: GVote是一种有效的自适应KV缓存压缩方案，能实现更好的精度 - 效率权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

TL;DR: 本文提出BMRNG和BAMG用于磁盘基近似最近邻搜索，设计多层导航图和块优先搜索算法，实验显示BAMG性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有磁盘基近似最近邻搜索的图索引方案忽视存储布局和图结构的相互作用，磁盘I/O是大规模时的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出BMRNG联合考虑几何距离和存储布局选边；开发BAMG从单调图线性构建；设计多层导航图和块优先搜索算法。

Result: 在真实数据集实验中，BAMG吞吐量最高达2.1倍，I/O读取减少52%，召回率相当。

Conclusion: BAMG在磁盘基近似最近邻搜索中有效，能提高吞吐量并减少I/O读取。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors is a
foundational problem in databases, where disk I/O often emerges as the dominant
performance bottleneck at scale. Existing graph indexing solutions for
disk-based ANNS typically either optimize the storage layout for a given graph
or construct the graph independently of the storage layout, thus overlooking
their interaction. In this paper, we propose the Block-aware Monotonic Relative
Neighborhood Graph (BMRNG), a novel graph structure that jointly considers both
geometric distance and storage layout for edge selection, theoretically
guaranteeing the existence of I/O monotonic search paths. To address the
scalability challenge of BMRNG construction, we further develop a practical and
efficient variant, the Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG), which can be
constructed in linear time from a monotonic graph considering the storage
layout. BAMG integrates block-aware edge pruning with a decoupled storage
design that separates raw vectors from the graph index, thereby maximizing
block utilization and minimizing redundant disk reads. Additionally, we design
a multi-layer navigation graph for adaptive and efficient query entry, along
with a block-first search algorithm that prioritizes intra-block traversal to
fully exploit each disk I/O operation. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BAMG achieves up to 2.1x higher throughput and
reduces I/O reads by up to 52% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while
maintaining comparable recall.

Motivation: 随着数据库内AI分析普及，现有数据库系统存储深度学习模型存在存储开销大的问题，需要高效管理模型。

Method: 1. 采用基于张量的模型存储引擎，增强HNSW图索引张量并进行张量级去重；2. 提出增量量化算法压缩增量张量；3. 设计压缩感知的模型加载机制。

Result: NeurStore在压缩比和模型加载吞吐量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NeurStore能有效实现深度学习模型的高效存储和利用。

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 云计算数据中心能耗有上升趋势，科学界已提出绿云计算相关方法，本文用经济手段进一步降低能耗。

Method: 提出 GreenCloud 税模型，在 CloudSim 环境模拟，用 SPEC 基准测试的真实数据集评估。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: The cloud computing technology uses datacenters, which require energy. Recent
trends show that the required energy for these datacenters will rise over time,
or at least remain constant. Hence, the scientific community developed
different algorithms, architectures, and approaches for improving the energy
efficiency of cloud datacenters, which are summarized under the umbrella term
Green Cloud computing. In this paper, we use an economic approach - taxes - for
reducing the energy consumption of datacenters. We developed a tax model called
GreenCloud tax, which penalizes energy-inefficient datacenters while fostering
datacenters that are energy-efficient. Hence, providers running
energy-efficient datacenters are able to offer cheaper prices to consumers,
which consequently leads to a shift of workloads from energy-inefficient
datacenters to energy-efficient datacenters. The GreenCloud tax approach was
implemented using the simulation environment CloudSim. We applied real data
sets published in the SPEC benchmark for the executed simulation scenarios,
which we used for evaluating the GreenCloud tax.

Motivation: 现实中大语言模型训练的可靠性问题难解决，现有集体通信库是黑盒，缺乏关键信息。

Conclusion: Mycroft能有效解决大语言模型训练中集体通信此前隐藏的可靠性问题。

Abstract: Reliability is essential for ensuring efficiency in LLM training. However,
many real-world reliability issues remain difficult to resolve, resulting in
wasted resources and degraded model performance. Unfortunately, today's
collective communication libraries operate as black boxes, hiding critical
information needed for effective root cause analysis. We propose Mycroft, a
lightweight distributed tracing and root cause analysis system designed to
address previously hidden reliability issues in collective communication.
Mycroft's key idea is to trace collective communication states and leverage
internal control and data dependencies to resolve reliability problems in LLM
training. Mycroft has been deployed at ByteDance for over six months to debug
collective communication related issues at runtime. It detected anomalies
within 15 seconds in 90% of cases and identified the root cause within 20
seconds in 60% of cases. We also conducted extensive fault injection
experiments to demonstrate Mycroft's capability and efficiency.

Motivation: 大语言模型大规模训练需大量AI加速器集群和复杂并行策略，硬件和软件故障会导致训练时间大幅损失，需解决系统可靠性问题。

Result: FlashRecovery系统能在150秒内完成4800个设备训练集群的训练恢复，不同规模训练任务故障恢复时间相近。

Conclusion: FlashRecovery系统能实现最佳恢复时间和恢复点目标，提高长时间大语言模型训练的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact across various
fields due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these models at
unprecedented scales requires extensive AI accelerator clusters and
sophisticated parallelism strategies, which pose significant challenges in
maintaining system reliability over prolonged training periods. A major concern
is the substantial loss of training time caused by inevitable hardware and
software failures. To address these challenges, we present FlashRecovery, a
fast and low-cost failure recovery system comprising three core modules: (1)
Active and real-time failure detection. This module performs continuous
training state monitoring, enabling immediate identification of hardware and
software failures within seconds, thus ensuring rapid incident response; (2)
Scale-independent task restart. By employing different recovery strategies for
normal and faulty nodes, combined with an optimized communication group
reconstruction protocol, our approach ensures that the recovery time remains
nearly constant, regardless of cluster scale; (3) Checkpoint-free recovery
within one step. Our novel recovery mechanism enables single-step restoration,
completely eliminating dependence on traditional checkpointing methods and
their associated overhead. Collectively, these innovations enable FlashRecovery
to achieve optimal Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective
(RPO), substantially improving the reliability and efficiency of long-duration
LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that FlashRecovery system can
achieve training restoration on training cluster with 4, 800 devices in 150
seconds. We also verify that the time required for failure recovery is nearly
consistent for different scales of training tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多租户云环境中虚拟化不能保证性能隔离，现有管理技术需准确性能预测，但公共云因VM黑盒和工作负载动态性而有挑战。

Method: 提出基于双分支Transformer的CloudFormer模型，联合建模时间动态和系统交互，利用206个系统指标；提供细粒度数据集。

Result: CloudFormer在多个评估指标上始终优于现有基线，实现跨不同和未见工作负载的鲁棒泛化，MAE仅7.8%，至少比现有方法提高28%。

Conclusion: CloudFormer在预测VM性能下降方面有显著优势，提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Cloud platforms are increasingly relied upon to host diverse,
resource-intensive workloads due to their scalability, flexibility, and
cost-efficiency. In multi-tenant cloud environments, virtual machines are
consolidated on shared physical servers to improve resource utilization. While
virtualization guarantees resource partitioning for CPU, memory, and storage,
it cannot ensure performance isolation. Competition for shared resources such
as last-level cache, memory bandwidth, and network interfaces often leads to
severe performance degradation. Existing management techniques, including VM
scheduling and resource provisioning, require accurate performance prediction
to mitigate interference. However, this remains challenging in public clouds
due to the black-box nature of VMs and the highly dynamic nature of workloads.
To address these limitations, we propose CloudFormer, a dual-branch
Transformer-based model designed to predict VM performance degradation in
black-box environments. CloudFormer jointly models temporal dynamics and
system-level interactions, leveraging 206 system metrics at one-second
resolution across both static and dynamic scenarios. This design enables the
model to capture transient interference effects and adapt to varying workload
conditions without scenario-specific tuning. Complementing the methodology, we
provide a fine-grained dataset that significantly expands the temporal
resolution and metric diversity compared to existing benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving robust generalization
across diverse and previously unseen workloads. Notably, CloudFormer attains a
mean absolute error (MAE) of just 7.8%, representing a substantial improvement
in predictive accuracy and outperforming existing methods at least by 28%.

Motivation: 解决无服务器计算控制平面设计中因缺乏开放跨平台基准和详细系统分析导致的性能 - 成本权衡理解不足的问题。

Method: 设计近似商业提供商扩展行为的无服务器系统，重放真实工作负载并改变关键自动扩展参数，结合实际控制平面部署和大规模模拟的混合方法。

Result: 开源系统可复制商业平台操作特征，发现计算开销达10 - 40% CPU周期、内存分配是活跃使用量2 - 10倍，减少开销会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前系统需新的成本高效自动扩展策略以平衡性能和成本。

Abstract: Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the
performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood
due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses.
In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that
approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and
cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by
replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters.
  We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the
operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and
transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect
latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First,
we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due
to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request
handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high
memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used.
Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in
significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the
need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a
hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with
large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale,
thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world
environments.

Result: 协议在常见场景通常只需4Δ网络延迟，能抵御最多1/2的恶意参与者；显著防止分叉、提升链稳定性；在节点参与适度波动场景中，相比最长链协议能保持稳定性和低延迟。

Conclusion: 该协议在不损害完整性的前提下，提升了效率和安全性，对拜占庭攻击具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols for dynamically available
systems face a critical challenge: balancing latency and security in
fluctuating node participation. Existing solutions often require multiple
rounds of voting per decision, leading to high latency or limited resilience to
adversarial behavior. This paper presents a BFT protocol integrating a
pre-commit mechanism with publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) into
message transmission. By binding users' identities to their messages through
PVSS, our approach reduces communication rounds. Compared to other
state-of-the-art methods, our protocol typically requires only four network
delays (4$\Delta$) in common scenarios while being resilient to up to 1/2
adversarial participants. This integration enhances the efficiency and security
of the protocol without compromising integrity. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates the robustness of the protocol against Byzantine attacks.
Experimental evaluations show that, compared to traditional BFT protocols, our
protocol significantly prevents fork occurrences and improves chain stability.
Furthermore, compared to longest-chain protocol, our protocol maintains
stability and lower latency in scenarios with moderate participation
fluctuations.

Abstract: In this work, we study the generalized sorting problem, where we are given a
set of $n$ elements to be sorted, but only a subset of all possible pairwise
element comparisons is allowed. We look at the problem from the perspective of
the graph formed by the ``forbidden'' pairs, and we parameterize algorithms
using the clique number and the chromatic number of this graph. We also extend
these results to the class of problems where the input graph is not necessarily
sortable, and one is only interested in discovering the partial order. We use
our results to develop a simple algorithm that always determines the underlying
partial order in $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ probes, when the input graph is an
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rank aggregation problem, which has many real-world applications, refers
to the process of combining multiple input rankings into a single aggregated
ranking. In dynamic settings, where new rankings arrive over time, efficiently
updating the aggregated ranking is essential. This paper develops a fast,
theoretically and practically efficient dynamic rank aggregation algorithm.
First, we develop the LR-Aggregation algorithm, built on top of the LR-tree
data structure, which is itself modeled on the LR-distance, a novel and
equivalent take on the classical Spearman's footrule distance. We then analyze
the theoretical efficiency of the Pick-A-Perm algorithm, and show how it can be
combined with the LR-aggregation algorithm using another data structure that we
develop. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that LR-Aggregation
produces close to optimal solutions in practice. We show that Pick-A-Perm has a
theoretical worst case approximation guarantee of 2. We also show that both the
LR-Aggregation and Pick-A-Perm algorithms, as well as the methodology for
combining them can be run in $O(n \log n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first fast, near linear time rank aggregation algorithm in the
dynamic setting, having both a theoretical approximation guarantee, and
excellent practical performance (much better than the theoretical guarantee).

Motivation: 大规模图上精确求解1 - 中位数问题计算成本高，而现实中客户节点少且集中，传统方法低效且不必要。

Method: 提出三种提前终止Dijkstra算法的近似算法。

Result: 一种算法近似比为2，另外两种为1.618，下界为1.2，客户节点数小于等于3时返回最优解；实验显示算法在运行时间上显著优于基线精确方法，同时保持接近最优的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提算法在大规模图的1 - 中位数问题上，能有效减少计算量，在运行时间和准确性上有优势。

Abstract: The 1-median problem (1MP) on undirected weighted graphs seeks to find a
facility location minimizing the total weighted distance to all customer nodes.
Although the 1MP can be solved exactly by computing the single-source shortest
paths from each customer node, such approaches become computationally expensive
on large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. In many real-world applications,
such as recommendation systems based on large-scale knowledge graphs, the
number of nodes (i.e., potential facility locations) is enormous, whereas the
number of customer nodes is relatively small and spatially concentrated. In
such cases, exhaustive graph exploration is not only inefficient but also
unnecessary. Leveraging this observation, we propose three approximation
algorithms that reduce computation by terminating Dijkstra's algorithm early.
We provide theoretical analysis showing that one of the proposed algorithms
guarantees an approximation ratio of 2, whereas the other two improve this
ratio to 1.618. We demonstrate that the lower bound of the approximation ratio
is 1.2 by presenting a specific instance. Moreover, we show that all proposed
algorithms return optimal solutions when the number of customer nodes is less
than or equal to three. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
significantly outperform baseline exact methods in runtime while maintaining
near-optimal accuracy across all tested graph types. Notably, on grid graphs
with 10 million nodes, our algorithms obtains all optimal solutions within 1
millisecond, whereas the baseline exact method requires over 70 seconds on
average.

Motivation: 为最坏情况稀疏图的三角形检测提供有效方法，解决现有方法可能存在的问题，如全局代数卷积可能破坏近线性计算或遇到细粒度障碍。

Method: 将图处理为O(log n)独立层，划分边为基于前缀的类，通过PK对齐找出潜在见证，用三阶段零误报管道验证候选，实例化R = c_G log n个独立PK组提高每层命中率。

Result: 算法总运行时间O(m log²n)，峰值空间O(m log n)，能生成Seeds+Logs工件供第三方复现检查和认证NO实例，证明单PK族命中率下界为Θ(1/log n)。

Conclusion: 该框架有效用于最坏情况稀疏图的三角形检测，指出使用Θ(log n)独立组的必要性，还给出通往拉斯维加斯O(m log n)和确定性近线性变体的路径。

Abstract: We present a non-algebraic, locality-preserving framework for triangle
detection in worst-case sparse graphs. Our algorithm processes the graph in
$O(\log n)$ independent layers and partitions incident edges into prefix-based
classes where each class maintains a 1-sparse triple over a prime field.
Potential witnesses are surfaced by pair-key (PK) alignment, and every
candidate is verified by a three-stage, zero-false-positive pipeline: a
class-level 1-sparse consistency check, two slot-level decodings, and a final
adjacency confirmation. \textbf{To obtain single-run high-probability coverage,
we further instantiate $R=c_G\log n$ independent PK groups per class (each
probing a constant number of complementary buckets), which amplifies the
per-layer hit rate from $\Theta(1/\log n)$ to $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ without
changing the accounting.} A one-shot pairing discipline and class-term
triggering yield a per-(layer,level) accounting bound of $O(m)$, while
keep-coin concentration ensures that each vertex retains only $O(d^+(x))$ keys
with high probability. Consequently, the total running time is $O(m\log^2 n)$
and the peak space is $O(m\log n)$, both with high probability. The algorithm
emits a succinct Seeds+Logs artifact that enables a third party to replay all
necessary checks and certify a NO-instance in $\tilde O(m\log n)$ time. We also
prove a $\Theta(1/\log n)$ hit-rate lower bound for any single PK family under
a constant-probe local model (via Yao)--motivating the use of $\Theta(\log n)$
independent groups--and discuss why global algebraic convolutions would break
near-linear accounting or run into fine-grained barriers. We outline measured
paths toward Las Vegas $O(m\log n)$ and deterministic near-linear variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决压缩环境下字典匹配问题，不进行解压缩并在压缩字符串大小上实现高效时空

Method: 引入新技巧，如经典Aho - Corasick自动机的压缩表示和支持快速查询的字符串索引

Result: 算法达到O((m̄ + n̄)log log m + occ)期望时间和O(m̄)空间复杂度

Conclusion: 该算法是问题首个非平凡解，时间复杂度在log log m因子内最优

Abstract: Given a set of pattern strings $\mathcal{P}=\{P_1, P_2,\ldots P_k\}$ and a
text string $S$, the classic dictionary matching problem is to report all
occurrences of each pattern in $S$. We study the dictionary problem in the
compressed setting, where the pattern strings and the text string are
compressed using run-length encoding, and the goal is to solve the problem
without decompression and achieve efficient time and space in the size of the
compressed strings. Let $m$ and $n$ be the total length of the patterns
$\mathcal{P}$ and the length of the text string $S$, respectively, and let
$\overline{m}$ and $\overline{n}$ be the total number of runs in the run-length
encoding of the patterns in $\mathcal{P}$ and $S$, respectively. Our main
result is an algorithm that achieves $O( (\overline{m} + \overline{n})\log \log
m + \mathrm{occ})$ expected time, and $O(\overline{m})$ space, where
$\mathrm{occ}$ is the total number of occurrences of patterns in $S$. This is
the first non-trivial solution to the problem. Since any solution must read the
input, our time bound is optimal within an $\log \log m$ factor. We introduce
several new techniques to achieve our bounds, including a new compressed
representation of the classic Aho-Corasick automaton and a new efficient string
index that supports fast queries in run-length encoded strings.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能克服以往研究局限，保证收敛到执行稳定均衡，适用于任意数据分布映射。

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

Conclusion: 所提CBD方法能有效解决扩散器生成不确定性问题，在自动出价中取得良好效果。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合有标签和无标签数据进行检索增强生成有互补优势，但有效结合不同来源证据有挑战，聚合多个排序器输出可提升效果。

Method: 先对有标签和无标签数据来源使用标准排名融合技术聚合多个IR模型的顶级文档，对各来源检索分数分布进行z分数变换后合并。

Result: 在事实验证任务中，该方法始终优于表现最佳的单个排序器或来源。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效结合不同来源数据，提升检索增强生成效果，且有更好的域外泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes

complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

Conclusion: RVRec作为即插即用的与模型无关的嵌入增强方法，能有效提升现有多媒体推荐系统的个性化和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在八个真实世界数据集上，15亿参数的模型在零样本和跨领域推荐任务中达到或超过了70亿参数的大语言模型基线性能。

Conclusion: RecBase模型能有效提升推荐系统的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of

Result: 离线评估显示OneSearch在召回和排序上表现优越；在线A/B测试显示提升相关性，提高CTR、买家数和订单量，降低运营成本，提高模型FLOPs利用率。

Conclusion: OneSearch框架有效且可在多个搜索场景中部署，服务大量用户。

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of
millions of PVs daily.

Conclusion: LC原则能解决训练不稳定问题，提升模型的泛化性和鲁棒性，状态记忆至关重要。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解决类别不平衡的方法问题多，需更好的解决方案。

Method: 采用组感知阈值校准，为不同人口统计组设置不同决策阈值，并进行大量实验。

Result: 组特定阈值比SMOTE和CT - GAN增强模型的平衡准确率高1.5 - 4%，提升了最差组的平衡准确率；将组阈值应用于合成增强数据收益极小。

Conclusion: 组感知阈值校准是解决类别不平衡更简单、可解释和有效的方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Motivation: 非线性动力系统分岔现象产生多稳定解，确定性机器学习模型难以捕捉这种多样性，无法表示低对称结果。

Method: 提出基于流匹配的生成框架，通过等变建模保留系统对称性，引入对称匹配策略使预测和目标输出在群作用下对齐。

Result: 在多种系统上验证，流匹配在捕捉多模态分布和对称破缺分岔方面显著优于非概率和变分方法。

Conclusion: 流匹配为高维系统多稳定性建模提供了一种有原则且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Result: 实验表明该技术能集成到任何离散PG方法中，更快更稳健地带来奖励提升。

Conclusion: ACPG方法可行且有效，能在动作选择层产生理想配置并优化策略。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

Motivation: 肥胖是全球健康问题，机器学习用于早期肥胖风险预测有前景，但对集成技术的比较评估有限，因此要比较两种集成方法的准确性和效率。

Method: 利用两个数据集评估三种集成模型，从九种机器学习算法和50种超参数配置中选三个作为基学习器，进行数据预处理，用准确率和F1分数评估模型。

Conclusion: 集成堆叠在复杂数据分布下预测能力更强，混合多数投票仍是可靠替代方案。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Result: 模型在保留测试集上实现了0.72的AUROC。

Conclusion: 该方法是开发大规模临床适用的EEG数据分析基础模型的重要一步。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型的后训练优化对推理计算效率提升有限，且各层激活专家数量固定导致冗余计算和性能不佳。

Method: 引入数据无关优化技术LExI，利用模型权重估计各层相对重要性，自适应分配每层激活专家数量。

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI在推理效率上显著优于传统MoE剪枝方法，精度损失可忽略，如Qwen1.5 - MoE用LExI在Nvidia H100 GPU上吞吐量相同但精度高10%。

Conclusion: LExI能有效提升预训练MoE模型的推理效率，同时维持较好的精度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Conclusion: TopoMap方法有效，能生成有意义的地形地图，在突变分析中比随机选择更优。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Conclusion: Transparent Earth可作为地球地下初始基础模型，有望预测任意地下属性。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Conclusion: Structured Basis Function Network 有效填补了预测不确定性统一框架的空白，其可调机制有助于研究相关权衡。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Conclusion: 所提出的自监督预训练框架基于结构且高度灵活，特征向量学习可应用于所有基于图的数据集。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Conclusion: 检测和解决是功能不同的机制，这种分解有助于提高模型可解释性和针对性干预以增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Conclusion: QPQuant能有效解决DP - SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，在精度和计算效率上取得较好平衡。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Method: 引入JensUn，以Jensen - Shannon散度为训练目标；引入LKF数据集；提出用大语言模型作语义判断和最坏情况评估方法。

Result: JensUn比竞争方法有更好的遗忘 - 效用权衡，对良性再学习有强抵抗力；新评估框架显示现有方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 新方法和评估框架有助于提升大语言模型无学习的效果和评估准确性。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under

synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: 提出的方法具有竞争力且更透明。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Conclusion: SBICE支持在不确定性下进行因果基准测试的稳健且数据一致的方法。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及最终结论，但通过基准测试可评估PDRL的有效性和局限性。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Motivation: 解决自监督强化学习中学习多样技能时的可扩展性和评估问题，如高维特征空间影响技能搜索、技能多样性定义不一致等。

Method: 采用将生态学概念引入机器学习的样本多样性度量Vendi Score，提出统一框架VendiRL。

Result: 展示了Vendi Score有助于技能评估，VendiRL在不同相似函数下能激发不同形式的多样性。

Conclusion: VendiRL可支持在新的丰富交互环境中进行技能多样性预训练。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Motivation: 解决传统神经网络在信号频谱分析的挑战，以及FNN等方法中周期信号叠加问题，在预测近周期函数时取得更好效果。

Method: 提出Autoregressive - Weight - Enhanced AR - KAN混合模型，用Kolmogorov - Arnold Network处理静态非线性部分，通过预训练AR组件引入记忆。

Result: AR - KAN在72%的真实数据集上取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: AR - KAN混合模型结合两种方法优势，在信号分析和预测方面表现良好。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与不现实，在部分参与情况下易失效，需解决稀疏通信挑战。

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原理，实现优化器D - Byz - SGDM用于部分参与的拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习。

Result: 建立了收敛性保证，恢复了之前全参与的结果并匹配部分参与设置的基本下限，实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法在各种拜占庭攻击下训练稳定且鲁棒。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽有实证效果，但正交更新学习率难确定，AdaGrad可自适应缩放梯度，结合二者优势提出新算法。

Method: 结合基于范数的AdaGrad型步长和正交更新方向，只需对Muon做最小修改，计算一个额外标量变量。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛率，在CIFAR - 10分类和函数回归的实证中优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO算法结合了两种方法的优点，计算和内存高效，性能优越。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

Motivation: 现有传感器在增材制造实时监测中存在不足，如高速X射线成像成本高、吸收率数据单独使用噪声大，需一种有效方法。

Method: 提出多模态数据融合方法，结合CNN提取X射线数据空间特征、RNN提取吸收率信号时间特征，采用早期融合策略，将多模态模型用作迁移学习模型微调RNN模型。

Result: 双模态训练显著提高预测精度，训练后模型仅用吸收率数据就能推断熔池特征。

Conclusion: 该多模态融合方法可实现低成本实时监测，在增材制造中有广泛应用。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

Method: 提出针对二进制量化的优化目标和三种算法，通过自适应分组策略动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵来增强分块量化。

Result: 平均比特长度1.007位，量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型困惑度接近原模型，超先前SOTA BiLLM，与SOTA 4位方法有竞争力，压缩高效。

Conclusion: 所提方法在大语言模型二进制量化上有效，能高效压缩模型并保持性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Conclusion: 该工作通过离散函数几何视角提供了分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改进泛化提供新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Result: 在真实和合成道路网络以及多组交通流上测试，模型在所有数据集上性能优于基线

Conclusion: 所提DHCP模型在交通信号控制中有较好效果

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法在多放射性核素分析中有自动化、泛化性强、实时处理和工程可行性等优势，尤其适用于无参考材料或需现场快速分析场景。

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

Conclusion: 解释模糊性是问题的固有属性，而非仅仅是建模产物。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

Method: 提出无阈值框架AUC - IoU，在皮肤病学成像上评估七种归因方法。

Result: 单阈值指标结果矛盾，无阈值评估能可靠区分，XRAI相比LIME和普通积分梯度有显著提升，不同病变尺度性能有差异。

Conclusion: 建立消除评估假象的方法标准，为医学成像等提供理论见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性决策树技术研究局限于部分设计选项，为全面探索设计空间开展研究。

Method: 提出决策树学习算法设计空间的三种选项，通过在多数据集上实验对后两种未充分研究的选项进行表征。

Result: 引入了决策树设计空间中未被充分研究的两种选项。

Conclusion: 丰富了决策树在公平性方面的设计选项和研究。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在稀疏奖励任务有挑战，GCSL框架存在学习自身经验会加剧偏差、只关注成功结果的问题。

Method: 将对比学习原则集成到GCSL框架中，使模型能从成功和失败中学习。

Result: 算法克服了代理初始偏差的限制，实现更多探索行为。

Conclusion: 新模型能在各种具有挑战性的环境中识别并采用有效策略，表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

*Yuxuan Gu,Wuyang Zhou,Giorgos Iacovides,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出新的参数高效微调方法TeRA，可在保持参数效率的同时实现高秩权重更新，实验表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA风格适配器在提高模型表达能力和减少参数数量上存在权衡问题，需解决此问题。

Method: 将张量化的权重更新矩阵参数化为类似Tucker的张量网络，冻结大的随机初始化因子并跨层共享，仅训练小的特定层缩放向量。

Result: TeRA表现与或优于高秩适配器，所需可训练参数数量与基于向量的方法相近。

Conclusion: 理论分析和消融研究验证了TeRA方法的有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于窗口的F1指标(F1$_w$)用于时间序列事件检测评估，能更鲁棒评估模型，分析显示其能揭示传统指标看不见的模型性能模式，为医疗应用提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估指标在不均衡的时间序列事件检测数据集中会误判模型性能，需要更合适的评估指标。

Method: 引入基于窗口的F1指标(F1$_w$)，该指标包含时间容差。

Result: 在三个生理数据集上的实证分析表明，F1$_w$能揭示传统指标看不见的模型性能模式，窗口大小可根据领域知识调整避免高估；使用TimesFM预测时，只有时间容忍指标能显示在两个实际用例中相对随机和零基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了时间序列评估的关键空白，为医疗应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Result: 相比现有RIS元素分配方案，所提基于神经网络的解决方案降低计算开销，系统吞吐量提高6.8%。

Conclusion: 所提系统性能更好，计算复杂度降低，比迭代优化算法更具可扩展性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Result: 在多种合成基准和实际应用中评估，显示出比现有方法更好的通用性和竞争力。

Conclusion: FoMEMO范式在昂贵多目标优化中具有良好表现，无需后续模型训练或更新，能适应未知问题。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 结构转移演算是一种系统无关的演算，能在广泛实际场景中识别替代表征。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

Conclusion: HyPV - LEAD将异常检测从被动分类转向主动预警，为动态区块链环境下的实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和金融安全奠定基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Conclusion: 利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，将程序合成与交通工程相结合，开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Method: 通过基于稳定性的分析表明GANs对数据扰动的敏感性低于扩散模型，并用标准化MIA管道进行全面实证研究。

Result: 结果显示，即使在强差分隐私机制下，GANs始终比扩散模型有明显的隐私鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: 模型类型会显著影响隐私泄露情况。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLVR中ORM粗粒度和PRM不准确易被攻击的问题，提升推理过程质量。

Method: 引入PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择，利用ORM和PRM的互补优势，保留合适的正负样本并保持平衡。

Result: 相比混合方法，最终准确率持续提升超4%，并增强了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF方法有效解决了现有问题，提升了数学推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Result: Glorot启发初始化在参数丰富模型中显著优于基线，幂律初始化在各任务和不同规模架构上整体表现最强。

Conclusion: 幂律初始化方案在样条KANs中具有最佳性能，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于序列的模型LINKER预测蛋白残基与配体官能团相互作用，仅需序列输入，实验效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在蛋白 - 配体可解释性方面有局限性，如依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，影响适用性和生物学相关性。

Method: 引入LINKER模型，用结构监督注意力进行训练，通过基于官能团的基序提取从3D蛋白 - 配体复合物中获得相互作用标签，推理时仅需序列输入。

Result: 在LP - PDBBind基准测试中，基于官能团抽象的结构信息监督产生的相互作用预测与真实生化注释高度一致。

Conclusion: LINKER模型仅需序列输入，可在无结构数据情况下大规模应用，能准确预测相互作用。

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Result: 模型能准确捕获动态环境中流体行为，在静态自由落体环境也可作为模拟器，可有效泛化到新对象和新操作任务。

Conclusion: 所学习的动力学可利用基于梯度的优化方法解决控制和操纵任务。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

Method: 证明在非奇异控制下参数子空间构成有限余维的Banach子流形，并刻画其切空间。

Result: 发现TwF对应控制函数沿该Banach子流形切空间的延拓/变形。

Conclusion: 为TwF在顺序训练中的映射保持（不遗忘）特性提供了精确的理论依据。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Result: 在不同数据集实验中，Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景下性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Robult性能优越、设计轻量可扩展，适合现实世界多模态应用。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

Method: 提出AEnt方法，利用新的带自动调整系数的钳位熵奖励，在较小的标记空间上评估，且根据钳位熵值自动调整熵系数。

Result: AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集的数学推理任务中，在多个基准测试中始终优于基线。

Conclusion: AEnt方法能有效控制熵引起的偏差，同时利用熵的好处，在LLM - RL中表现良好。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 准确获取全球尺度作物类型及分布很重要，但遥感作物分类受限于可靠地面样本不足，为解决地理空间转移下性能下降问题。

Method: 构建全球作物类型数据集CropGlobe；比较不同遥感特征（时间多光谱特征、高光谱特征）的可迁移性；设计轻量级CNN网络CropNet，结合时间数据增强方法。

Result: Sentinel - 2的2D中位数时间特征在所有转移场景中始终表现出最强的不变性，数据增强提高了模型鲁棒性，特别是训练数据多样性有限时。

Conclusion: 确定了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理可迁移性，为全球不同地区的低成本作物类型应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备存在内存和通信限制，典型联邦优化算法会排除部分设备，导致数据不可用和系统偏差，且此前零阶优化器仅限微调。

Method: 设计联邦、内存高效的零阶优化器ZOWarmUp，利用客户端不同能力和方差减少技术。

Result: 通过不同数据集和模型架构实验，表明ZOWarmUp是健壮算法，可在多种情况下应用。

Conclusion: 对于大量边缘设备被排除的系统，ZOWarmUp能获取更多样数据，改善训练结果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

Conclusion: 成功展示模块化自组装系统的局部控制，可迁移到其他空间相关系统。

Abstract: We present a decentralized model for autonomous reconfiguration of
homogeneous pivoting cube modular robots in two dimensions. Each cube in the
ensemble is controlled by a neural network that only gains information from
other cubes in its local neighborhood, trained using reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, using geometric deep learning, we include the grid symmetries of
the cube ensemble in the neural network architecture. We find that even the
most localized versions succeed in reconfiguring to the target shape, although
reconfiguration happens faster the more information about the whole ensemble is
available to individual cubes. Near-optimal reconfiguration is achieved with
only nearest neighbor interactions by using multiple information passing
between cubes, allowing them to accumulate more global information about the
ensemble. Compared to standard neural network architectures, using geometric
deep learning approaches provided only minor benefits. Overall, we successfully
demonstrate mostly local control of a modular self-assembling system, which is
transferable to other space-relevant systems with different action spaces, such
as sliding cube modular robots and CubeSat swarms.

Conclusion: 生物合理的动态门控是基于脉冲计算的关键机制，为构建更具弹性、高效和仿生的SNN铺平道路。

Abstract: While spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a biologically inspired and
energy-efficient computational framework, their robustness and the dynamic
advantages inherent to biological neurons remain significantly underutilized
owing to oversimplified neuron models. In particular, conventional leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons often omit the dynamic conductance mechanisms
inherent in biological neurons, thereby limiting their capacity to cope with
noise and temporal variability. In this work, we revisit dynamic conductance
from a functional perspective and uncover its intrinsic role as a biologically
plausible gating mechanism that modulates information flow. Building on this
insight, we introduce the Dynamic Gated Neuron~(DGN), a novel spiking unit in
which membrane conductance evolves in response to neuronal activity, enabling
selective input filtering and adaptive noise suppression. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that DGN possess enhanced stochastic stability
compared to standard LIF models, with dynamic conductance intriguingly acting
as a disturbance rejection mechanism. DGN-based SNNs demonstrate superior
performance across extensive evaluations on anti-noise tasks and
temporal-related benchmarks such as TIDIGITS and SHD, consistently exhibiting
excellent robustness. Our results highlight, for the first time, a biologically
plausible dynamic gating as a key mechanism for robust spike-based computation,
providing not only theoretical guarantees but also strong empirical
validations. This work thus paves the way for more resilient, efficient, and
biologically inspired spiking neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce the Neural Field Turing Machine (NFTM), a differentiable
architecture that unifies symbolic computation, physical simulation, and
perceptual inference within continuous spatial fields. NFTM combines a neural
controller, continuous memory field, and movable read/write heads that perform
local updates. At each timestep, the controller reads local patches, computes
updates via learned rules, and writes them back while updating head positions.
This design achieves linear O(N) scaling through fixed-radius neighborhoods
while maintaining Turing completeness under bounded error. We demonstrate three
example instantiations of NFTM: cellular automata simulation (Rule 110),
physics-informed PDE solvers (2D heat equation), and iterative image refinement
(CIFAR-10 inpainting). These instantiations learn local update rules that
compose into global dynamics, exhibit stable long-horizon rollouts, and
generalize beyond training horizons. NFTM provides a unified computational
substrate bridging discrete algorithms and continuous field dynamics within a
single differentiable framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统分散开发和持续演进会导致沟通不畅和实现不兼容，影响系统可维护性和可靠性。

Method: 静态重构微服务源代码为形式化系统模型，导出SMT约束集进行形式化验证。

Result: 提出的方法可扩展，支持多方面软件验证，聚焦系统架构验证并给出形式化推理。

Conclusion: 该方法有正确性和适用性，考虑了其他方面并明确未来拓展和评估方向。

Abstract: Microservice systems are becoming increasingly adopted due to their
scalability, decentralized development, and support for continuous integration
and delivery (CI/CD). However, this decentralized development by separate teams
and continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible
implementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across
aspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel
methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal
system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is
extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting
concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system
architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's
correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as
security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are
established to extend and evaluate the methodology.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用定制提示工程评估大语言模型检测多语言代码中SOLID原则违反情况的方法，通过新基准数据集测试不同提示策略，发现模型有性能差异，提示策略影响大，检测精度受语言和代码复杂度影响，需定制化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态分析方法难以检测语义设计缺陷，现有解决方案无法检测多语言代码库中全部五个SOLID原则的违反情况。

Method: 利用定制提示工程评估四个大语言模型（CodeLlama、DeepSeekCoder、QwenCoder和GPT - 4o Mini）检测多语言代码中SOLID原则违反情况，构建含240个手动验证代码示例的基准数据集，测试四种提示策略。

Result: 模型性能有明显层次，GPT - 4o Mini表现最佳但处理DIP原则仍有困难；不同提示策略效果不同，无通用最优策略；检测精度受语言特性和代码复杂度影响。

Conclusion: 有效的AI驱动设计分析需要根据具体设计上下文匹配合适的模型和提示，大语言模型在AI辅助代码分析以支持代码可维护性方面有潜力。

Abstract: Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,
such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong
understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing
solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific
programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across
all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new
approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess
LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We
present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,
and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID
principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240
manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct
prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and
chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection
accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with
GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with
challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a
dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a
deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE
prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection
accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply
with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that
effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a
tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific
design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability
through AI-assisted code analysis.

Motivation: 在电动汽车中集成AI技术给安全保障带来挑战，传统评估方法不适用于评估基于AI的功能，需要新的标准和实践。

Method: 结合ISO 26262和ISO/PAS 8800对电动汽车AI组件进行独立评估，以AI驱动的电池荷电状态估计为例，通过故障注入实验进行鲁棒性测试。

Result: 文中未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in electric vehicles (EV)
introduces unique challenges for safety assurance, particularly within the
framework of ISO 26262, which governs functional safety in the automotive
domain. Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating
AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper
explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be
achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800,
whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC)
battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the
independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As
part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted
using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are
systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input
variance.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了严格实用的评估框架，强调需要能反映现实利用场景的评估协议。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software
vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated
evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on
superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading
to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper
introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional
Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,
containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential
assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail
execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved
extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500
potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances
(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through
VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and
observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model
successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical
weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that
most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and
patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies
and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall
effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent,
practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and
underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect
real-world exploitation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决从自然语言描述自动化生成模型时的结构正确性和语义对齐问题。

Method: 提出LADEX管道，设计五种消融变体，用基于跟踪的操作语义评估生成的活动图。

Result: 批判-改进循环提升结构有效性等；算法结构检查比仅用LLM检查提升正确性和完整性；结合算法结构检查和LLM语义检查性能最佳。

Conclusion: LADEX管道有效，结合算法结构检查和LLM语义检查能高效准确地从自然语言生成活动图。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential for automating the
generation of models from natural-language descriptions. A common approach is
an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are
produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs
to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules
- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in
the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a
pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process
descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in
LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment
checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX
to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of
LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of
algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.
  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with
expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This
enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on
two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural
validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)
algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks
fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness
by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks
with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4
Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of
up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer
than five LLM calls on average.

Motivation: 评估AXI作为SOFR补充的可行性，以解决美元LIBOR过渡中信用敏感性缺失问题。

Method: 分析AXI的构建，研究其与FXI的相关性，实证分析AXI与标准信用利差、市场压力指标等的关系，以及SOFR+AXI在贷款定价中的应用。

Result: AXI与标准信用利差等指标强相关，SOFR+AXI能降低融资风险、支持利差折扣，在压力情景下SOFR单独定价有损失。

Conclusion: AXI恢复了美元LIBOR过渡中失去的信用敏感性，避免依赖短期市场，带来显著经济价值。

Abstract: In the LIBOR era, banks routinely tied revolving credit facilities to
credit-sensitive benchmarks. This study assesses the Across-the-Curve Credit
Spread Index (AXI) -- a transparent, transaction-based measure of wholesale
bank funding costs -- as a complement to SOFR, summarizing its behavior,
construction, and loan-pricing implications. AXI aggregates observable
unsecured funding transactions across short- and long-term maturities to
produce a daily credit spread that is IOSCO-aligned and operationally
compatible with SOFR-based infrastructure. The Financial Conditions Credit
Spread Index (FXI) is a broader market companion to AXI and serves as its
fallback. FXI co-moves closely with AXI in normal times; under stress, the
correlation of daily changes exceeds 0.9 for economy-wide shocks and remains
strong in bank-specific stress, around 0.8 during the Silicon Valley Bank
episode. Empirically, AXI is strongly correlated with standard credit-spread
measures and market-stress indicators and is inversely related to
financial-sector performance. SOFR+AXI exhibits correlations with macroeconomic
variables with the signs and magnitudes expected of a credit-sensitive rate. In
loan-pricing applications, SOFR+AXI reduces funding risk and can support spread
discounts of up to 65 basis points without lowering risk-adjusted returns. In
stress scenarios, banks relying on SOFR-only pricing can fail to recover as
much as 15 basis points on revolving credit lines over as little as three
months. Taken together, AXI restores the credit sensitivity lost in the USD
LIBOR transition while avoiding reliance on thin short-term markets, delivering
significant economic value.

Motivation: 传统高保真求解器对参数化偏微分方程在参数空间的数值评估计算量大，需高效方法。

Conclusion: 所提LC - prior GP替代建模框架能有效结合数据驱动学习与物理约束，处理复杂几何上的多耦合变量。

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental mathematical
tools for modeling complex physical systems, yet their numerical evaluation
across parameter spaces remains computationally intensive when using
conventional high-fidelity solvers. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel physical law-corrected prior Gaussian process (LC-prior GP) surrogate
modeling framework that effectively integrates data-driven learning with
underlying physical constraints to flexibly handle multi-coupled variables
defined on complex geometries. The proposed approach leverages proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) to parameterize high-dimensional PDE solutions
via their dominant modes and associated coefficients, thereby enabling
efficient Gaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling within a reduced-dimensional
coefficient space. A key contribution lies in the incorporation of physical
laws together with a limited number of parameter samples to correct the GP
posterior mean, thus avoiding reliance on computationally expensive numerical
solvers. Furthermore, interpolation functions are constructed to describe the
mapping from the full parameter space to the physics-based correction term.
This mapping is subsequently backpropagated to constrain the original GP
surrogate, yielding a more physically consistent conditional prior. To handle
irregular geometries, the radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD)
method is incorporated during training set computation, with its inherent
differentiation matrices providing both computational efficiency and numerical
accuracy for physical constraint optimization. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments involving a
reaction-diffusion model, miscible flooding models, and Navier-Stokes equations
with multi-physics coupling defined on irregular domains.

Conclusion: 该框架为核方法在大规模学习任务中的常规应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools in statistical learning, but their cubic
complexity in the sample size n limits their use on large-scale datasets. In
this work, we introduce a scalable framework for kernel regression with O(n log
n) complexity, fully leveraging GPU acceleration. The approach is based on a
Fourier representation of kernels combined with non-uniform fast Fourier
transforms (NUFFT), enabling exact, fast, and memory-efficient computations. We
instantiate our framework in three settings: Sobolev kernel regression,
physics-informed regression, and additive models. When known, the proposed
estimators are shown to achieve minimax convergence rates, consistent with
classical kernel theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods can
process up to tens of billions of samples within minutes, providing both
statistical accuracy and computational scalability. These contributions
establish a flexible approach, paving the way for the routine application of
kernel methods in large-scale learning tasks.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决流基生成模型的问题，在生成高保真样本上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling
scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors
in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of
stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and
interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be
smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum
decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For
Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known,
we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to
standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we
develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical
ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on
synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and
Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to
generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional
approaches.

Conclusion: ANOVA - BART平衡了预测准确性、可解释性和理论一致性，是BART的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a powerful statistical model
that leverages the strengths of Bayesian inference and regression trees. It has
received significant attention for capturing complex non-linear relationships
and interactions among predictors. However, the accuracy of BART often comes at
the cost of interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose ANOVA
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (ANOVA-BART), a novel extension of BART
based on the functional ANOVA decomposition, which is used to decompose the
variability of a function into different interactions, each representing the
contribution of a different set of covariates or factors. Our proposed
ANOVA-BART enhances interpretability, preserves and extends the theoretical
guarantees of BART, and achieves superior predictive performance. Specifically,
we establish that the posterior concentration rate of ANOVA-BART is nearly
minimax optimal, and further provides the same convergence rates for each
interaction that are not available for BART. Moreover, comprehensive
experiments confirm that ANOVA-BART surpasses BART in both accuracy and
uncertainty quantification, while also demonstrating its effectiveness in
component selection. These results suggest that ANOVA-BART offers a compelling
alternative to BART by balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and
theoretical consistency.

Motivation: 此前工作主要用Frobenius范数分析Shampoo估计方案，本文受二阶矩与协方差矩阵联系启发，从KL散度最小化角度研究，发现其隐藏局限以改进设计。

Method: 从KL散度最小化角度将Shampoo估计视为协方差估计研究，在此基础上开发KL - Shampoo估计方案。

Result: 初步结果显示KL - Shampoo提升了Shampoo性能，无需Adam即可稳定，在神经网络预训练中优于Adam稳定版SOAP。

Conclusion: 从KL散度最小化角度研究Shampoo有效，KL - Shampoo是更优的改进方案。

Abstract: As an adaptive method, Shampoo employs a structured second-moment estimation,
and its effectiveness has attracted growing attention. Prior work has primarily
analyzed its estimation scheme through the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the
natural connection between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we
propose studying Shampoo's estimation as covariance estimation through the lens
of Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. This alternative perspective reveals a
previously hidden limitation, motivating improvements to Shampoo's design.
Building on this insight, we develop a practical estimation scheme, termed
KL-Shampoo, that eliminates Shampoo's reliance on Adam for stabilization,
thereby removing the additional memory overhead introduced by Adam. Preliminary
results show that KL-Shampoo improves Shampoo's performance, enabling it to
stabilize without Adam and even outperform its Adam-stabilized variant, SOAP,
in neural network pretraining.

Method: 利用个体结果总和的集中特性推导可扩展下降算法

Result: 得到可直接优化目标的算法

Conclusion: 该算法可用于最大化A/B测试成功概率，相比追求最高期望回报，以成功标准为目标更明智

Abstract: We consider the problem of directly optimizing a non-linear function of an
outcome, where this outcome itself is the sum of many small contributions. The
non-linearity of the function means that the problem is not equivalent to the
maximization of the expectation of the individual contribution. By leveraging
the concentration properties of the sum of individual outcomes, we derive a
scalable descent algorithm that directly optimizes for our stated objective.
This allows for instance to maximize the probability of successful A/B test,
for which it can be wiser to target a success criterion, such as exceeding a
given uplift, rather than chasing the highest expected payoff.

Result: 当前OPL方法在动作空间变大时遇到严重优化问题，简单加权对数似然目标有更好优化特性，能得到有竞争力甚至更优的策略。

Conclusion: 开发大动作空间的OPL算法时需明确考虑优化因素。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are foundational
for decision-making in offline contextual bandits. Recent advances in OPL
primarily optimize OPE estimators with improved statistical properties,
assuming that better estimators inherently yield superior policies. Although
theoretically justified, we argue this estimator-centric approach neglects a
critical practical obstacle: challenging optimization landscapes. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and extensive empirical evidence showing
that current OPL methods encounter severe optimization issues, particularly as
action spaces become large. We demonstrate that simpler weighted log-likelihood
objectives enjoy substantially better optimization properties and still recover
competitive, often superior, learned policies. Our findings emphasize the
necessity of explicitly addressing optimization considerations in the
development of OPL algorithms for large action spaces.

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in
promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots
raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore
these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine
three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in
real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical
investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic
technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning
robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three
communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of
the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,
and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.
In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot
Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with
Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our
analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical
questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'
insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in
light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future
investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that
roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in
order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic
applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The
four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is
the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证RL失控优化问题在LLMs中是否仍相关。

Method: 未提及具体方法，主要通过分析各种场景下LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在各种场景下会以特定方式失去上下文，类似失控优化器，长期运行会出现随机触发的问题行为倾向，底层机制仍偏向单目标和无界。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs虽概念上掌握生物和经济对齐，但在长期运行涉及多目标或竞争目标时会有问题，且一旦出现问题通常无法恢复。

Abstract: Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers
of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like
the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded
maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these
RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns
out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the
LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various
scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically
resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring
homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It
is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to
single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running
scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially
successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.
This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic
alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies
under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or
competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though
LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms
seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.

TL;DR: 多数企业AI部署未获显著利润，提出2x2框架分析AI策略模式，指出协同智能实现机制及推进所需的组织变革。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多数企业AI部署无显著利润的问题，分析背后的范式锁定原因。

Method: 采用跨案例分析方法，提出2x2框架，并结合案例研究分析。

Result: 框架呈现四种AI策略模式，前三种强化传统工作模式，协同智能需三种机制，当前协同进化缺失，推进需组织架构调整。

Conclusion: AI转型是组织设计挑战，要从优化分工转向架构融合。

Abstract: Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises
report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). We argue
that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental
optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case
analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along
two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental
to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to
amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:
individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less
deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first
three reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable
value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:
complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution
(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human
determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and
boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;
co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level
impact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative
intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data
architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI
transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing
the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their
convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and
the future of work.

Conclusion: 该方法是检测不断演变的语音深度伪造威胁的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly in speech synthesis, have
enabled the generation of highly natural-sounding synthetic speech that closely
mimics human voices. While these innovations hold promise for applications like
assistive technologies, they also pose significant risks, including misuse for
fraudulent activities, identity theft, and security threats. Current research
on spoofing detection countermeasures remains limited by generalization to
unseen deepfake attacks and languages. To address this, we propose a gating
mechanism extracting relevant feature from the speech foundation XLS-R model as
a front-end feature extractor. For downstream back-end classifier, we employ
Multi-kernel gated Convolution (MultiConv) to capture both local and global
speech artifacts. Additionally, we introduce Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as
a similarity metric to enforce diversity in learned features across different
MultiConv layers. By integrating CKA with our gating mechanism, we hypothesize
that each component helps improving the learning of distinct synthetic speech
patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on in-domain benchmarks while generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain datasets, including multilingual speech samples. This
underscores its potential as a versatile solution for detecting evolving speech
deepfake threats.

Motivation: 传统统计模型无法很好拟合多传感器远程信息处理和ADAS警告数据集，且周近失事件（NMEs）稀疏、高度零膨胀和行为异质，需要更好方法进行风险预测。

Method: 提出一组零膨胀泊松（ZIP）框架，学习潜在行为组，通过EM算法拟合基于偏移的计数模型。

Abstract: Driving behavior big data leverages multi-sensor telematics to understand how
people drive and powers applications such as risk evaluation, insurance
pricing, and targeted intervention. Usage-based insurance (UBI) built on these
data has become mainstream. Telematics-captured near-miss events (NMEs) provide
a timely alternative to claim-based risk, but weekly NMEs are sparse, highly
zero-inflated, and behaviorally heterogeneous even after exposure
normalization. Analyzing multi-sensor telematics and ADAS warnings, we show
that the traditional statistical models underfit the dataset. We address these
challenges by proposing a set of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) frameworks that
learn latent behavior groups and fit offset-based count models via EM to yield
calibrated, interpretable weekly risk predictions. Using a naturalistic dataset
from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, during which the drivers
completed 287,511 trips and logged 8,142,896 km in total, our results show
consistent improvements over baselines and prior telematics models, with lower
AIC/BIC values in-sample and better calibration out-of-sample. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses on the EM-based grouping for the number of
clusters, finding that the gains were robust and interpretable. Practically,
this supports context-aware ratemaking on a weekly basis and fairer premiums by
recognizing heterogeneous driving styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近碰撞极值模型存在简化碰撞几何、忽略车 - 基础设施交互、未充分捕捉车辆动力学空间异质性等问题，难以实现走廊级碰撞发生风险的实时预测。

Method: 在 HBSGRP 框架下引入 2D - TTC 指标，使用非平稳单变量广义极值（UGEV）模型，分析高分辨率轨迹数据提取极端车 - 车和车 - 基础设施近碰撞情况，将动态变量和道路特征作为协变量，通过位置间部分池化处理未观测异质性。

Result: HBSGRP - UGEV 框架优于固定参数替代模型，V - V 近碰撞 DIC 最多降低 7.5%，V - I 近碰撞最多降低 3.1%；ROC - AUC 显示强预测性能；揭示了不同场景下各类风险的主导因素。

Conclusion: 统计严谨、几何敏感且空间自适应的建模方法对主动式走廊级安全管理有重要价值，支持实时干预和符合 Vision Zero 的长期设计策略。

Abstract: Real-time prediction of corridor-level crash occurrence risk (COR) remains
challenging, as existing near-miss based extreme value models oversimplify
collision geometry, exclude vehicle-infrastructure (V-I) interactions, and
inadequately capture spatial heterogeneity in vehicle dynamics. This study
introduces a geometry-aware two-dimensional time-to-collision (2D-TTC)
indicator within a Hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal grouped random
parameter (HBSGRP) framework using a non-stationary univariate generalized
extreme value (UGEV) model to estimate short-term COR in urban corridors.
High-resolution trajectories from the Argoverse-2 dataset, covering 28
locations along Miami's Biscayne Boulevard, were analyzed to extract extreme
V-V and V-I near misses. The model incorporates dynamic variables and roadway
features as covariates, with partial pooling across locations to address
unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that the HBSGRP-UGEV framework
outperforms fixed-parameter alternatives, reducing DIC by up to 7.5% for V-V
and 3.1% for V-I near-misses. Predictive validation using ROC-AUC confirms
strong performance: 0.89 for V-V segments, 0.82 for V-V intersections, 0.79 for
V-I segments, and 0.75 for V-I intersections. Model interpretation reveals that
relative speed and distance dominate V-V risks at intersections and segments,
with deceleration critical in segments, while V-I risks are driven by speed,
boundary proximity, and steering/heading adjustments. These findings highlight
the value of a statistically rigorous, geometry-sensitive, and spatially
adaptive modeling approach for proactive corridor-level safety management,
supporting real-time interventions and long-term design strategies aligned with
Vision Zero.

Motivation: 传统参数化后处理技术和机器学习方法难以捕捉预报维度间的依赖关系，需进行多变量后处理。

Method: 使用结合能量得分和变分图得分的复合损失函数训练图神经网络（dualGNN）进行多变量后处理，并在两个数据集上评估。

Result: dualGNN在评估的多变量验证指标上始终优于所有基于经验copula的后处理预报，相比仅用连续排名概率得分（CRPS）或能量得分（ES）训练的图神经网络有显著改进。

Conclusion: dualGNN方法在集合预报的多变量后处理中表现良好，能有效恢复空间关系。

Abstract: Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing
probabilistic estimates of future states, supporting applications from
renewable energy production to transportation safety. Nonetheless, systematic
biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional
parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can
produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead
times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions.
To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula
coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore
realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study
is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural
network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the
energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two
datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF
visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms
all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant
improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the
continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) or the ES, according to the
evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF
forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable
dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial
relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or
historical observational rank structures. By contrast, for the visibility
forecasts, the GNNs trained on CRPS, ES, or the ES-VS combination outperform
the calibrated reference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on people's behalf: they write
emails, buy groceries, and book restaurants. While the outsourcing of human
decision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a
fundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI
reshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two
identity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a
person's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the
breadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from
social-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we
compare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift
people's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of
their behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers
this homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly
compresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what
they explore across topics and psychological affinities. Understanding how AI
agents might flatten human experience, and how using generic versus
personalized agents involves distinctiveness-diversity trade-offs, is critical
for designing systems that augment rather than constrain human agency, and for
safeguarding diversity in thought, taste, and expression.

Abstract: In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue
between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of
this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite
their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for
information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a
novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to
our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of
interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In
this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected
specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train
and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment
the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation,
which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust.
The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline,
baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research
community.

Conclusion: LCOAI是评估和比较AI成本效率的有效指标，同时讨论了政策影响和未来改进方向。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes foundational to enterprise
infrastructure, organizations face growing challenges in accurately assessing
the full economic implications of AI deployment. Existing metrics such as API
token costs, GPU-hour billing, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fail to capture
the complete lifecycle costs of AI systems and provide limited comparability
across deployment models. This paper introduces the Levelized Cost of
Artificial Intelligence (LCOAI), a standardized economic metric designed to
quantify the total capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures per unit
of productive AI output, normalized by valid inference volume. Analogous to
established metrics like LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and LCOH
(levelized cost of hydrogen) in the energy sector, LCOAI offers a rigorous,
transparent framework to evaluate and compare the cost-efficiency of vendor API
deployments versus self-hosted, fine-tuned models. We define the LCOAI
methodology in detail and apply it to three representative scenarios, OpenAI
GPT-4.1 API, Anthropic Claude Haiku API, and a self-hosted LLaMA-2-13B
deployment demonstrating how LCOAI captures critical trade-offs in scalability,
investment planning, and cost optimization. Extensive sensitivity analyses
further explore the impact of inference volume, CAPEX, and OPEX variability on
lifecycle economics. The results illustrate the practical utility of LCOAI in
procurement, infrastructure planning, and automation strategy, and establish it
as a foundational benchmark for AI economic analysis. Policy implications and
areas for future refinement, including environmental and performance-adjusted
cost metrics, are also discussed.

Conclusion: 信息控制是从源头遏制数字合谋的轻量级且实用的手段。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous pricing systems has sparked growing concern over
algorithmic collusion in markets from retail to housing. This paper examines
controlled information quality as an ex ante policy lever: by reducing the
fidelity of data that pricing algorithms draw on, regulators can frustrate
collusion before supracompetitive prices emerge. We show, first, that
information quality is the central driver of competitive outcomes, shaping
prices, profits, and consumer welfare. Second, we demonstrate that collusion
can be slowed or destabilized by injecting carefully calibrated noise into
pooled market data, yielding a feasibility region where intervention disrupts
cartels without undermining legitimate pricing. Together, these results
highlight information control as a lightweight yet practical lever to blunt
digital collusion at its source.

Conclusion: 同化政策有持久影响，为当代移民和教育政策辩论提供见解。

Abstract: This paper examines the short- and long-term effects of immigrant
assimilation policies in Brazil following the Mass Migration period. I focus on
the Nationalization Campaign, launched by the federal government amid rising
anti-immigrant sentiment during the Great Depression and the two World Wars.
Using newly assembled archival data spanning the twentieth century, I assess
the impact of these policies on the educational outcomes of immigrants and
their descendants, following the forced closure of hundreds of
immigrant-community schools. In the short term, the campaign significantly
reduced educational attainment among targeted immigrant groups across state,
municipal, and individual levels. In the long term, immigrants who were
school-age during the campaign attained less education over their lifetimes,
with adverse effects extending into the second generation. The magnitude of
these effects was mediated by the degree of cultural proximity between
immigrant groups and native Brazilians. These findings underscore the enduring
consequences of assimilationist policies and offer insights for contemporary
debates on immigration and education policy.

Conclusion: 所提框架为个性化营销策略和数字消费金融提供新见解。

Abstract: Fintech lending has become a central mechanism through which digital
platforms stimulate consumption, offering dynamic, personalized credit limits
that directly shape the purchasing power of consumers. Although prior research
shows that higher limits increase average spending, scalar-based outcomes
obscure the heterogeneous distributional nature of consumer responses. This
paper addresses this gap by proposing a new causal inference framework that
estimates how continuous changes in the credit limit affect the entire
distribution of consumer spending. We formalize distributional causal effects
within the Wasserstein space and introduce a robust Distributional Double
Machine Learning estimator, supported by asymptotic theory to ensure
consistency and validity. To implement this estimator, we design a deep
learning architecture comprising two components: a Neural Functional Regression
Net to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between treatments, covariates,
and distributional outcomes, and a Conditional Normalizing Flow Net to estimate
generalized propensity scores under continuous treatment. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed estimator accurately recovers distributional
effects in a range of data-generating scenarios. Applying our framework to
transaction-level data from a major BigTech platform, we find that increased
credit limits primarily shift consumers towards higher-value purchases rather
than uniformly increasing spending, offering new insights for personalized
marketing strategies and digital consumer finance.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的文本嵌入方法利用最终标记嵌入，但这些标记未针对捕获整体上下文语义训练，限制其在检索和重排序任务中的能力。

Method: 在对比学习前增加新训练阶段，采用双向生成重建任务EBQ2D和EBD2Q来锚定[EOS]嵌入并重建查询 - 文档对。

Result: 在MTEB上显著提升LLM性能，在不同LLM基础模型和规模上取得新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的额外训练阶段能有效提升LLM文本嵌入性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text
embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the
embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].
However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the
semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,
especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training
stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token
embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,
namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based
Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and
reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results
demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM
performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new
state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Method: 从2100篇文本中运用计算方法对语义相似的故事分组，进行定性分析，提出结合机器学习技术和手动定性话语分析的综合方法。

Result: 出现三种主要的话语表征，即社会克服、祖先神话化和主观自我实现，且语法连贯、看似中立的文本强化了历史不平等。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成的文本存在殖民结构的女性身体框架，强化历史不平等，综合分析方法具有可行性。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA
3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories
generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to
group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative
analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming,
ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers
how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized,
colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical
inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine
learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

Motivation: 提升阿拉伯语长上下文问答生成的性能和效率，增强阿拉伯语大视觉语言模型的长上下文理解能力。

Method: 编排多个专业LVLMs（问题生成器、评估器和答案生成器群），形成闭环循环，通过低置信度输出触发自动再生和模型更新；设置可调节的质量指标；构建文档收集工作流。

Result: 自进化工作流显著优于静态管道，提升了领先阿拉伯语LVLMs的长上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的自进化对抗工作流在阿拉伯语长上下文问答生成中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context
Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple
specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer
generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any
human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across
diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware
queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses
and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous
learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model
updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,
we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question
generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release
AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page
challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving
workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the
long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated
agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

TL;DR: 探讨大语言模型知识产权保护，提出用知识编辑注入指纹，针对指纹退化提出FSFT方法，但指纹注入模型仍需更优方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有通过指令调优注入指纹的大语言模型知识产权保护技术存在性能下降、计算资源需求大、持久性差等问题。

Method: 首次将知识编辑应用于指纹注入，提出Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT)方法来减少指纹退化。

Result: FSFT在最坏情况下性能比微调高10%，指纹注入模型难以区分指纹和相似文本。

Conclusion: 需要为大语言模型开发更强大、更细粒度的指纹注入方法。

Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through
instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may
significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational
resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue
that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable
for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to
fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability.
Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being
overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale
fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning
(FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the
fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even
in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the
fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and
similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding
underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting
injection methods for LLMs.

Result: 相比RNN和叙事风格方案，在多任务设置中预测性能有潜在提升，微调模型收敛更快，超参数优化需求少。

Conclusion: 直接适配预训练大语言模型处理流程数据有优势，参数高效微调技术可行。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent
area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining
(PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt
engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style
datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address
diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of
pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation,
motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of
tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational
overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses
on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and
multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in
predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN)
approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the
multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster
convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Motivation: 解决ASA模型中存在的类别不平衡导致预测有偏差的问题。

Method: 引入Balancing Logit Variation (BLV)损失函数，在不修改数据集的情况下扰动模型预测以改善少数类别的特征表示。

Result: 在ICNALE基准数据集上，将BLV损失集成到基于文本的BERT模型中，显著提高了分类的准确率和公平性。

Conclusion: BLV损失使自动语音评估对不同学习者更稳健。

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating
second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer
from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we
introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit
Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature
representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations
on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a
celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification
accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for
diverse learners.

Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired
and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its
significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access
to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social
exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend
on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although
certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for
individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent
requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially
for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions
have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a
considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,
specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of
isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of
continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research
represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we
introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,
focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable
sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.
Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained
ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with
Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at
signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This
development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL
community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign
language.

Method: 提出SurGBSA方法，学习MMGBSA替代函数，在超140万条MD模拟轨迹上进行物理信息预训练。

Conclusion: 在MD模拟上训练可改进模型，推动分子基础模型发展，相关模型、代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and
proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features
demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks
including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand
interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static
structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve
prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA
(SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning,
which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born
Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of
physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection
of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the
CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a
traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching
single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for
identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances
the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements
when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made

Motivation: 协调MIES中灵活性资产交互可高效整合可再生能源和实现低成本能源转型，但资产增多和需求响应参与使协调更复杂，需新的建模方法。

Abstract: Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier
integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of
variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition.
However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in
active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these
interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the
coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market
auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of
preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of
scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative
price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and
computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable
for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way.
From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and
electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new
open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example,
flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate
the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential
information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and
regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.

Motivation: 医学影像中领域泛化是关键挑战，单源训练模型在实际分布变化下常失效，需解决糖尿病视网膜病变分类的跨域泛化问题。

Method: 将视觉变换器与专家引导的符号推理相结合，利用临床病变本体和视网膜血管分割，通过置信加权融合策略与深度视觉表征融合，最小化域嵌入间的KL散度。

Result: 在四个公共数据集实验中，跨域设置准确率最高提升5.2%，较基线ViT模型提升6%；符号模型在多域泛化中平均准确率达63.67%；完整神经符号集成在单域泛化场景中准确率最高；基于病变特征表现优于纯神经方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医疗AI系统的有前景范式。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for

MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between
resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen
lesion contours.

Result: 未提及具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 未提及。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can
indicate their developmental status, but traditional fluorescence labeling
methods risk compromising their structure. Therefore, this paper proposes an
automated, non-destructive approach to organoid segmentation and tracking. We
introduced the LGBP-OrgaNet, a deep learning-based system proficient in
accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass
Fusion, to merge data from two branches. Additionally, in the decoder, the
model proposes a Bidirectional Cross Fusion Block to fuse multi-scale features,
and finally completes the decoding through progressive concatenation and
upsampling. SROrga demonstrates satisfactory segmentation accuracy and
robustness on organoids segmentation datasets, providing a potent tool for
organoid research.

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该框架能为ViTs减少高达80%的FLOPs，精度仅有极小损失。

Conclusion: TinyDrop框架具有泛化能力和实际效用，可用于高效基于ViT的分类。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

TL;DR: 提出跨域特征转移方法，利用TRELLIS模型特征增强颅内动脉瘤分析神经网络，在多项任务中表现良好，证明通用生成模型特征转移到医疗任务的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤临床风险大，但因3D标注数据有限，难以检测、描绘和建模。

Method: 提出跨域特征转移方法，用TRELLIS表面特征替代传统特征，增强下游任务的神经网络。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在准确率、F1分数和分割质量上优于现有基线，减少15%的模拟误差。

Conclusion: 通用生成模型的3D表征转移到专业医疗任务有更广泛的潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to
detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a
cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时空推理方面存在不足，下一代AI伴侣需解决动态真实环境中的时空引用问题。

Method: 引入Strefer合成指令数据生成框架，用数据引擎对视频元数据进行伪标注以生成多样的指令调优数据。

Result: 使用Strefer生成的数据训练的模型在时空消歧任务上优于基线模型，展现出更强的时空感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer框架为基于感知的指令调优视频大语言模型奠定了新基础。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 现有生成大脑MRI方法存在未明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔关系、缺乏临床实用性、忽略3D解剖背景等局限，需要准确预测大脑结构未来变化的方法。

Method: 提出TADM - 3D模型，使用预训练BAE指导扩散模型生成MRI，提出BITR训练模型双向预测。

Result: 在OASIS - 3数据集上训练评估，在NACC数据集外部测试集验证泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM - 3D能准确预测大脑MRI进展，BITR有助于生成时间上更准确的扫描结果。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Count2Density管道，仅用计数级注释预测密度图，实验显示效果好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人群密度估计依赖细粒度位置注释，收集繁琐，阻碍实际应用可扩展性，需减轻负担。

Method: 利用历史地图库生成伪密度图，用无监督显著性估计器初始化库，迭代更新；从估计人群区域采样位置获取伪密度图；添加自监督对比空间正则化器。

Result: 显著优于跨域适应方法，在半监督设置中比最新技术方法效果好。

Conclusion: Count2Density能从计数级注释有效提取空间信息，实现准确子区域计数。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Motivation: 当前单细胞RNA测序数据嵌入方法主要关注基因表达水平，忽略关键基因 - 基因相互作用，存在分析局限性。

Method: 先通过随机森林模型构建Cell - Leaf Graph（CLG）捕捉基因调控关系，同时构建K - Nearest Neighbor Graph（KNNG）表示细胞表达相似性，再将两者合并为Enriched Cell - Leaf Graph（ECLG），作为图神经网络输入计算细胞嵌入。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法增强了对稀有细胞群体的检测，改善了可视化、聚类和轨迹推断等下游分析。

Conclusion: 这种整合方法是单细胞数据分析的重要进展，为理解细胞多样性和动态提供了更完整的框架。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into
cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological
systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and
technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical
challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression
levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular
identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding
approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven
gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG)
using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes,
while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent
expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an
Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural
network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and
gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive
representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple
datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell
populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering,
and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant
advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for
understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.

Motivation: 高维多组学数据的患者生存预测需要能确保预测性能、稀疏性和可靠性的特征选择方法用于预后生物标志物发现。

Method: 开发hEFS方法，结合数据子采样和多个预后模型，集成嵌入式和基于包装器的策略，用投票理论启发的聚合机制对组学特征排名，通过帕累托前沿选择最佳特征数量。

Result: 应用于三个胰腺癌队列的多组学数据集时，与传统的晚期融合CoxLasso模型相比，hEFS识别出的生物标志物显著更少且更稳定，同时保持相当的判别性能。

Conclusion: hEFS在开源mlr3fselect R包中实现，为高维生存环境中的预后建模和生物标志物发现提供了一个强大、可解释且具有临床价值的工具。

Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data
requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive
performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We
developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines
data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and
wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked
using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and
subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto
front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any
user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three
pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable
biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while
maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the
open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and
clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in
high-dimensional survival settings.

Abstract: Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores
collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material
ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural
activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons,
into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio,
living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed
through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by
natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using
biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity
as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and
atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally
fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound
resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment,
filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring
real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field
shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials
and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a
practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for
ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.

Abstract: Accurate breast MRI lesion detection is critical for early cancer diagnosis,
especially in high-risk populations. We present a classification pipeline that
adapts a pretrained foundation model, the Medical Slice Transformer (MST), for
breast lesion classification using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).
Leveraging DINOv2-based self-supervised pretraining, MST generates robust
per-slice feature embeddings, which are then used to train a Kolmogorov--Arnold
Network (KAN) classifier. The KAN provides a flexible and interpretable
alternative to conventional convolutional networks by enabling localized
nonlinear transformations via adaptive B-spline activations. This enhances the
model's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced
and heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80
\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.
Our findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model
embeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and
generalizable breast MRI analysis tools.

Result: 在1000个难题的Hard子集中，DR.INFO的HealthBench得分为0.51，优于前沿LLMs；在100个样本评估中，对比类似RAG助手，得分0.54保持领先。

Conclusion: 行为级、基于规则的评估对构建可靠可信的人工智能临床支持助手很有用。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate
high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions
requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems
behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are
often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential
competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling
etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical
support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark
composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard
subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of
0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3,
GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness,
instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against
similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a
performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight
DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while
also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a
response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level,
rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled
clinical support assistant.

Result: 模型未能检测到大量已知相互作用，未识别出四个经实验验证的SARS - CoV - 2突变体结合情况。

Conclusion: 当前预测过滤器不足以可靠标记已知生物威胁，更难检测新威胁，应转向响应式基础设施。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative biology have enabled the design of novel
proteins, creating significant opportunities for drug discovery while also
introducing new risks, including the potential development of synthetic
bioweapons. Existing biosafety measures primarily rely on inference-time
filters such as sequence alignment and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
prediction to detect dangerous outputs. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of three leading PPI prediction tools: AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, and
SpatialPPIv2. These models were tested on well-characterized viral-host
interactions, such as those involving Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2. Despite being
trained on many of the same viruses, the models fail to detect a substantial
number of known interactions. Strikingly, none of the tools successfully
identify any of the four experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants with
confirmed binding. These findings suggest that current predictive filters are
inadequate for reliably flagging even known biological threats and are even
more unlikely to detect novel ones. We argue for a shift toward
response-oriented infrastructure, including rapid experimental validation,
adaptable biomanufacturing, and regulatory frameworks capable of operating at
the speed of AI-driven developments.

Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches
for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in
cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The
research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and
process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models,
just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial
case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess
conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions
under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and
identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective
for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical
importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline
analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model
performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating
conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the
usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced
accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations
based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of
robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and
changing biomanufacturing environments.

Method: 用HPE Chapel语言设计并行算法，利用其并行结构提升性能和可扩展性，集成到Arkouda/Arachne框架。

Result: 能对超20亿边的大规模图进行连通性社区检测，如用128核在几分钟内完成Open - Alex数据集社区检测。

Conclusion: 为网络规模的连通性保持聚类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures
in networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly
connected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected
Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing
techniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they
are computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present
optimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel
programming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms
that leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance
improvements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we
integrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance
framework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable
well-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion
edges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at
web scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community
detection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128
cores, a result infeasible to compute previously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有监督方法依赖标签数据，在标签稀缺场景受限，现有对比学习方法多依赖多嵌入生成正负样本对。

Method: 将有影响节点识别转化为无标签深度聚类问题，利用基于正则等价的相似性构建对比学习机制，集成到图卷积网络学习节点嵌入，用网络重建损失预训练，结合对比和聚类损失微调，结合结构指标和正则等价相似性增强节点表示。

Result: ReCC在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCC是一种有效的无监督有影响节点识别框架，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in
network analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep
learning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches
remain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable.
While contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance
enhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding
generation to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ReCC (\textit{r}egular \textit{e}quivalence-based
\textit{c}ontrastive \textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework
for influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node
identification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a
contrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based
similarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local
neighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is
integrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are
used to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is
pre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined
contrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled
data. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural
metrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GNN方法在通过移动连接数据进行时间社交网络分析有前景，但ROLAND与基线模型性能差距小，需进一步研究专门架构。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven
tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and
integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as
of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's
mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present
study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the
phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In
addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed
EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms
the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on
average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches
hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile
connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin
between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on
specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.

Result: 分析为P - ALM提供新理论视角，非近端变体ALM有类似收敛性质，数值实验证明方法有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的不精确近端增广拉格朗日方法对于非凸结构化优化问题是有效的。

Abstract: We propose an inexact proximal augmented Lagrangian method (P-ALM) for
nonconvex structured optimization problems. The proposed method features an
easily implementable rule not only for updating the penalty parameters, but
also for adaptively tuning the proximal term. It allows the penalty parameter
to grow rapidly in the early stages to speed up progress, while ameliorating
the issue of ill-conditioning in later iterations, a well-known drawback of the
traditional approach of linearly increasing the penalty parameters. A key
element in our analysis lies in the observation that the augmented Lagrangian
can be controlled effectively along the iterates, provided an initial feasible
point is available. Our analysis, while simple, provides a new theoretical
perspective about P-ALM and, as a by-product, results in similar convergence
properties for its non-proximal variant, the classical augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM). Numerical experiments, including convex and nonconvex problem
instances, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: F²SA - p的上界在高光滑区域p = Ω(log ε⁻¹ / log log ε⁻¹)近乎最优。

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
for stochastic bilevel optimization when the upper-level problem is nonconvex
and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent work proposed the
first-order method, F${}^2$SA, achieving the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$ upper complexity bound for first-order
smooth problems. This is slower than the optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$
complexity lower bound in its single-level counterpart. In this work, we show
that faster rates are achievable for higher-order smooth problems. We first
reformulate F$^2$SA as approximating the hyper-gradient with a forward
difference. Based on this observation, we propose a class of methods
F${}^2$SA-$p$ that uses $p$th-order finite difference for hyper-gradient
approximation and improves the upper bound to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(p
\epsilon^{4-p/2})$ for $p$th-order smooth problems. Finally, we demonstrate
that the $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bound also holds for stochastic bilevel
problems when the high-order smoothness holds for the lower-level variable,
indicating that the upper bound of F${}^2$SA-$p$ is nearly optimal in the
highly smooth region $p = \Omega( \log \epsilon^{-1} / \log \log
\epsilon^{-1})$.

Abstract: Inverse problems lie at the heart of modern imaging science, with broad
applications in areas such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and microscopy.
Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in solving imaging inverse
problems, where data-driven regularizers are used increasingly, leading to
remarkably high-fidelity reconstruction. A particularly notable approach for
data-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors
in iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,
commonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a
brief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short
review of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal
splitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned
denoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such
replacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting
optimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the
foundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent
diffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances
regarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal
settings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy
for convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local
homogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,
including choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.

Conclusion: 通过随机线性算子克服对数障碍，在计算线性算子问题上取得进展，部分解决相关猜想。

Abstract: We consider a static data structure problem of computing a linear operator
under cell-probe model. Given a linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times
n}$, the goal is to pre-process a vector $X \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ into a data
structure of size $s$ to answer any query $\langle M_i , X \rangle$ in time
$t$. We prove that for a random operator $M$, any such data structure requires:
  $$ t \geq \Omega ( \min \{ \log (m/s) , n / \log s \} ).$$ This result
overcomes the well-known logarithmic barrier in static data structures [MNSW98,
Sie04, PD06, PTW08, Pat11, DGW19] by using a random linear operator.
Furthermore, it provides the first significant progress toward confirming a
decades-old folklore conjecture: that non-linear pre-processing does not
substantially help in computing most linear operators.
  A straightforward modification of our proof also yields a wire lower bound of
$\Omega(n \cdot \log^{1/d}(n))$ for depth-$d$ circuits with arbitrary gates
that compute a specific linear operator $M \in \mathbb{F}_2^{O(n) \times n}$,
even against some small constant advantage over random guessing. This bound
holds even for circuits with only a small constant advantage over random
guessing, improving upon longstanding results [RS03, Che08a, Che08b, GHK+13]
for a random operator.
  Finally, our work partially resolves the communication form of the Multiphase
Conjecture [Pat10] and makes progress on Jukna-Schnitger's Conjecture [JS11,
Juk12]. We address the former by considering the Inner Product (mod 2) problem
(instead of Set Disjointness) when the number of queries $m$ is
super-polynomial (e.g., $2^{n^{1/3}}$), and the total update time is
$m^{0.99}$. Our result for the latter also applies to cases with
super-polynomial $m$.

Abstract: In recent years, numerous incidents involving the leakage of website accounts
and text passwords (referred to as passwords) have raised significant concerns
regarding the potential exposure of personal information. These events
underscore the critical importance of both information security and password
protection. While many of these breaches are attributable to vulnerabilities
within website infrastructure, the strength and security of the passwords
themselves also play a crucial role. Consequently, the creation of secure
passwords constitutes a fundamental aspect of enhancing overall system security
and protecting personal data. In response to these challenges, this study
presents a secure password generation approach utilizing a cryptographically
secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). The generator is implemented
using a range of Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms, including the
Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), Cipher-based Message
Authentication Code (CMAC), and KECCAK Message Authentication Code (KMAC), to
produce robust random values suitable for password generation. To evaluate the
proposed method, empirical assessments were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines provided in the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-90B. The evaluation focused on two primary
aspects: entropy estimation and verification of independent and identically
distributed (IID) properties. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method satisfies both entropy and IID requirements, thereby demonstrating its
ability to generate passwords with a high degree of randomness and security.

Conclusion: TraceLLM框架在以太坊智能合约安全分析中表现良好，具有较强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet
comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code,
proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex
execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly
transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited
insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside
transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified
contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real
incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces
with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To
address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to
integrate execution trace-level detection with decompiled contract code. We
introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an
LLM-refined decompile tool to identify vulnerable functions and provide
explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for
joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy
baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three
representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies
attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated
reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert
reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover,
across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates
reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong
generalizability.

Conclusion: 所提方法能在有效保护用户隐私的同时，实现较高的推荐准确性和较低的通信成本。

Abstract: In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems personalize user
experiences across industries but rely on sensitive data, raising privacy
concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a
significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently
handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE
operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse
matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical
concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed
Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that
efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing
communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation
accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs,
effectively preserving user privacy.

Result: AHDP框架对数据和隐私间的可能相关性具有鲁棒性，存在无需先验知识的非平凡AHDP机制，机制简单易实现。

Conclusion: AHDP框架能解决标准HDP框架的不足，提出的机制适用于实际应用，发布的合成数据集可供未来研究。

Abstract: Previous works in the differential privacy literature that allow users to
choose their privacy levels typically operate under the heterogeneous
differential privacy (HDP) framework with the simplifying assumption that user
data and privacy levels are not correlated. Firstly, we demonstrate that the
standard HDP framework falls short when user data and privacy demands are
allowed to be correlated. Secondly, to address this shortcoming, we propose an
alternate framework, Add-remove Heterogeneous Differential Privacy (AHDP), that
jointly accounts for user data and privacy preference. We show that AHDP is
robust to possible correlations between data and privacy. Thirdly, we formalize
the guarantees of the proposed AHDP framework through an operational hypothesis
testing perspective. The hypothesis testing setup may be of independent
interest in analyzing other privacy frameworks as well. Fourthly, we show that
there exists non-trivial AHDP mechanisms that notably do not require prior
knowledge of the data-privacy correlations. We propose some such mechanisms and
apply them to core statistical tasks such as mean estimation, frequency
estimation, and linear regression. The proposed mechanisms are simple to
implement with minimal assumptions and modeling requirements, making them
attractive for real-world use. Finally, we empirically evaluate proposed AHDP
mechanisms, highlighting their trade-offs using LLM-generated synthetic
datasets, which we release for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟计算成本高限制了其在生物相关过程的应用，现有机器学习方法因缺乏MD数据集和模拟长历史轨迹计算需求大，难以生成扩展的生物分子系统轨迹。

Method: 引入BioMD，采用预测和插值的分层框架模拟长时间尺度的蛋白质 - 配体动力学。

Result: 在DD - 13M和MISATO数据集上，BioMD生成高度逼真的构象，物理合理性高且重建误差低；在十次尝试内，97.1%的蛋白质 - 配体系统中成功生成配体解聚路径。

Conclusion: BioMD可作为模拟复杂生物分子过程的工具，在计算化学和药物发现中有广泛应用。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools in computational
chemistry and drug discovery, offering crucial insights into dynamic molecular
behavior. However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial
computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many
biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of
existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended
biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and
the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here,
we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate
long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of
forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility
of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both
datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical
plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully
generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within
ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways.
Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex
biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational
chemistry and drug discovery.

Motivation: 高维数据的随机傅里叶特征方法有吸引力，但采样傅里叶频率是挑战，需解决该问题。

Method: 基于对频率进行重采样的渐近最优数据自适应方法，结合重采样和自适应随机游走步骤，用共轭梯度迭代近似最小二乘问题。

Result: 证明了数据自适应方法的收敛性，数值结果证实了对回归和分类问题分析的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据自适应方法在高维数据的随机傅里叶特征方法中有效可行。

Abstract: The machine learning random Fourier feature method for data in high dimension
is computationally and theoretically attractive since the optimization is based
on a convex standard least squares problem and independent sampling of Fourier
frequencies. The challenge is to sample the Fourier frequencies well. This work
proves convergence of a data adaptive method based on resampling the
frequencies asymptotically optimally, as the number of nodes and amount of data
tend to infinity. Numerical results based on resampling and adaptive random
walk steps together with approximations of the least squares problem by
conjugate gradient iterations confirm the analysis for regression and
classification problems.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出更新双对角分解的新算法，比SVD方法高效，在处理高吞吐量更新方面有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流短间隔变化常为低秩，高吞吐量信息按矩阵格式排列时，每步重新计算最优SVD近似代价高，增量和截断更新策略对大截断秩难以扩展。

Method: 提出更新双对角分解的新算法，包括解耦稀疏部分和低秩更新的紧凑Householder型算法，以及基于Givens旋转的算法。

Result: 新算法与SVD方法精度相似，Householder型算法内存需求约为标准双对角化方法的一半，Givens旋转算法每次旋转约10次浮点运算，复杂度为二次，而典型为三次。

Conclusion: 新算法在处理高吞吐量更新方面有效，在跟踪推荐系统和网络的大子空间等场景中得到验证，优于LAPACK和增量SVD等软件。

Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For
high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal
SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead,
incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for
large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms
that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the
SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm
that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the
memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm
based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales
quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The
algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we
demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks,
and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.

Result: 提示方法有一定性能但输出不稳定，微调后的Qwen - VL达到接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 通用视觉语言模型推理常体现为提示敏感性，虽经最小适配可与专业模型竞争，但使用需谨慎。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are
positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains.
Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and
potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In
this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to
astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio
galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies
using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within
prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised
adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even
prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs
encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs
are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such
as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is
held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no
astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near
state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models.
These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects
prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use
in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs
can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for
scientific discovery.

Conclusion: LAT Logic有潜力成为动态和不确定环境中开放世界时间推理的统一、可扩展框架。

Abstract: We introduce Lattice Annotated Temporal (LAT) Logic, an extension of
Generalized Annotated Logic Programs (GAPs) that incorporates temporal
reasoning and supports open-world semantics through the use of a lower lattice
structure. This logic combines an efficient deduction process with temporal
logic programming to support non-Markovian relationships and open-world
reasoning capabilities. The open-world aspect, a by-product of the use of the
lower-lattice annotation structure, allows for efficient grounding through a
Skolemization process, even in domains with infinite or highly diverse
constants.
  We provide a suite of theoretical results that bound the computational
complexity of the grounding process, in addition to showing that many of the
results on GAPs (using an upper lattice) still hold with the lower lattice and
temporal extensions (though different proof techniques are required). Our
open-source implementation, PyReason, features modular design, machine-level
optimizations, and direct integration with reinforcement learning environments.
Empirical evaluations across multi-agent simulations and knowledge graph tasks
demonstrate up to three orders of magnitude speedup and up to five orders of
magnitude memory reduction while maintaining or improving task performance.
Additionally, we evaluate LAT Logic's value in reinforcement learning
environments as a non-Markovian simulator, achieving up to three orders of
magnitude faster simulation with improved agent performance, including a 26%
increase in win rate due to capturing richer temporal dependencies. These
results highlight LAT Logic's potential as a unified, extensible framework for
open-world temporal reasoning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Our
implementation is available at: pyreason.syracuse.edu.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of tools designed to support scholarly
knowledge extraction and organization, many researchers still rely on manual
methods, sometimes due to unfamiliarity with existing technologies or limited
access to domain-adapted solutions. Meanwhile, the rapid increase in scholarly
publications across disciplines has made it increasingly difficult to stay
current, further underscoring the need for scalable, AI-enabled approaches to
structuring and synthesizing scholarly knowledge. Various research communities
have begun addressing this challenge independently, developing tools and
frameworks aimed at building reliable, dynamic, and queryable scholarly
knowledge bases. However, limited interaction across these communities has
hindered the exchange of methods, models, and best practices, slowing progress
toward more integrated solutions. This manuscript identifies ways to foster
cross-disciplinary dialogue, identify shared challenges, categorize new
collaboration and shape future research directions in scholarly knowledge and

Conclusion: S2M2ECG在性能、计算复杂度和心电图特性间实现良好平衡，为心血管疾病诊断的高性能轻量级计算提供新途径。

Abstract: As one of the most effective methods for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
diagnosis, multi-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals present a characteristic
multi-sensor information fusion challenge that has been continuously researched
in deep learning domains. Despite the numerous algorithms proposed with
different DL architectures, maintaining a balance among performance,
computational complexity, and multi-source ECG feature fusion remains
challenging. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various fields. Their inherent
design for high-efficiency computation and linear complexity makes them
particularly suitable for low-dimensional data like ECGs. This work proposes
S2M2ECG, an SSM architecture featuring three-level fusion mechanisms: (1)
Spatio-temporal bi-directional SSMs with segment tokenization for low-level
signal fusion, (2) Intra-lead temporal information fusion with bi-directional
scanning to enhance recognition accuracy in both forward and backward
directions, (3) Cross-lead feature interaction modules for spatial information
fusion. To fully leverage the ECG-specific multi-lead mechanisms inherent in
ECG signals, a multi-branch design and lead fusion modules are incorporated,
enabling individual analysis of each lead while ensuring seamless integration
with others. Experimental results reveal that S2M2ECG achieves superior
performance in the rhythmic, morphological, and clinical scenarios. Moreover,
its lightweight architecture ensures it has nearly the fewest parameters among
existing models, making it highly suitable for efficient inference and
convenient deployment. Collectively, S2M2ECG offers a promising alternative
that strikes an excellent balance among performance, computational complexity,
and ECG-specific characteristics, paving the way for high-performance,
lightweight computations in CVD diagnosis.

Motivation: 痴呆症是全球健康挑战，需早期准确诊断，传统脑电图方法难以捕捉其瞬态复杂性。

Method: 提出EEG - MSAF框架，包括自动微状态特征提取、机器学习分类、使用SHAP进行特征排名，在两个EEG数据集上评估。

Result: 在CAUEEG数据集上，EEG - MSAF - SVM准确率达89% ± 0.01，超基线19.3%；在Thessaloniki数据集上达95% ± 0.01，与EEGConvNeXt相当，SHAP分析确定关键指标和生物标志物。

Conclusion: EEG - MSAF结合准确性、可泛化性和可解释性，推动基于EEG的痴呆诊断，揭示认知谱上的脑动力学。

Abstract: Dementia (DEM) is a growing global health challenge, underscoring the need
for early and accurate diagnosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a
non-invasive window into brain activity, but conventional methods struggle to
capture its transient complexity. We present the \textbf{EEG Microstate
Analysis Framework (EEG-MSAF)}, an end-to-end pipeline that leverages EEG
microstates discrete, quasi-stable topographies to identify DEM-related
biomarkers and distinguish DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal
cognition (NC). EEG-MSAF comprises three stages: (1) automated microstate
feature extraction, (2) classification with machine learning (ML), and (3)
feature ranking using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to highlight key
biomarkers. We evaluate on two EEG datasets: the public Chung-Ang University
EEG (CAUEEG) dataset and a clinical cohort from Thessaloniki Hospital. Our
framework demonstrates strong performance and generalizability. On CAUEEG,
EEG-MSAF-SVM achieves \textbf{89\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, surpassing the deep
learning baseline CEEDNET by \textbf{19.3\%}. On the Thessaloniki dataset, it
reaches \textbf{95\% $\pm$ 0.01 accuracy}, comparable to EEGConvNeXt. SHAP
analysis identifies mean correlation and occurrence as the most informative
metrics: disruption of microstate C (salience/attention network) dominates DEM
prediction, while microstate F, a novel default-mode pattern, emerges as a key
early biomarker for both MCI and DEM. By combining accuracy, generalizability,
and interpretability, EEG-MSAF advances EEG-based dementia diagnosis and sheds
light on brain dynamics across the cognitive spectrum.

<details>

Motivation: 标准右删失方法不适用于区间删失数据，可能产生有偏结果，需新方法分析区间删失生存数据。

Method: 比较Turnbull非参数最大似然估计（NPMLE）、Weibull和对数正态加速失效时间（AFT）模型、贝叶斯AFT模型三种方法，用模拟评估相关指标，应用于卵巢癌数据集。

Result: EM算法恢复分布的ISE最低，AFT模型指定分布族正确时预测性能好，贝叶斯AFT能校准不确定性和进行模型选择。

Conclusion: 三种方法形成分层策略，分别用于形状发现、协变量驱动预测和完整不确定性量化与模型比较。

Abstract: Interval censoring occurs when event times are only known to fall between
scheduled assessments, a common design in clinical trials, epidemiology, and
reliability studies. Standard right-censoring methods, such as Kaplan-Meier and
Cox regression, are not directly applicable and can produce biased results.
This study compares three complementary approaches for interval-censored
survival data. First, the Turnbull nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator
(NPMLE) via the EM algorithm recovers the survival distribution without strong
assumptions. Second, Weibull and log-normal accelerated failure time (AFT)
models with interval likelihoods provide smooth, covariate-adjusted survival
curves and interpretable time-ratio effects. Third, Bayesian AFT models extend
these tools by quantifying posterior uncertainty, incorporating prior
information, and enabling interval-aware model comparisons via PSIS-LOO
cross-validation. Simulations across generating distributions, censoring
intensities, sample sizes, and covariate structures evaluated the integrated
squared error (ISE) for curve recovery, integrated Brier score (IBS) for
prediction, and coverage for uncertainty calibration. Results show that the EM
achieves the lowest ISE for distribution recovery, AFT models improve
predictive performance when families are correctly specified, and Bayesian AFT
offers calibrated uncertainty and principled model selection. An application to
the ovarian cancer dataset, restructured into interval-censored form,
demonstrates the workflow in practice: the EM algorithm reveals the baseline
shape, parametric AFT provides covariate-adjusted predictions, and Bayesian AFT
validates model adequacy through posterior predictive checks. Together, these
methods form a tiered strategy: EM for shape discovery, AFT for
covariate-driven prediction, and Bayesian AFT for complete uncertainty
quantification and model comparison.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在多视图数据协方差估计上有效，具有良好的理论性质和实际应用表现。

Abstract: This article focuses on covariance estimation for multi-view data. Popular
approaches rely on factor-analytic decompositions that have shared and
view-specific latent factors. Posterior computation is conducted via expensive
and brittle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational
approximations that underestimate uncertainty and lack theoretical guarantees.
Our proposed methodology employs spectral decompositions to estimate and align
latent factors that are active in at least one view. Conditionally on these
factors, we choose jointly conjugate prior distributions for factor loadings
and residual variances. The resulting posterior is a simple product of
normal-inverse gamma distributions for each variable, bypassing MCMC and
facilitating posterior computation. We prove favorable increasing-dimension
asymptotic properties, including posterior contraction and central limit
theorems for point estimators. We show excellent performance in simulations,
including accurate uncertainty quantification, and apply the methodology to
integrate four high-dimensional views from a multi-omics dataset of cancer cell
samples.

<details>

Motivation: 传统点预测无法量化预测准确性，经典预测区间依赖的正态性和线性假设在实际中很少满足，需新方法。

Method: 开发校准预测区间（cPI），利用深度神经网络（DNN）或核方法进行估计，并可调整以捕捉预测过程中的估计变异性。

Result: cPI具有渐近有效的覆盖率；基于核方法的cPI在大样本下以高概率保证覆盖率；基于DNN的cPI在有限样本下也有效。模拟研究和实证数据证实了cPI的有用性。

Conclusion: 提出的cPI方法能有效避免传统假设限制，在不同样本情况下都有良好表现，是一种实用的预测区间方法。

Abstract: Accurate conditional prediction in the regression setting plays an important
role in many real-world problems. Typically, a point prediction often falls
short since no attempt is made to quantify the prediction accuracy.
Classically, under the normality and linearity assumptions, the Prediction
Interval (PI) for the response variable can be determined routinely based on
the $t$ distribution. Unfortunately, these two assumptions are rarely met in
practice. To fully avoid these two conditions, we develop a so-called
calibration PI (cPI) which leverages estimations by Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
or kernel methods. Moreover, the cPI can be easily adjusted to capture the
estimation variability within the prediction procedure, which is a crucial
error source often ignored in practice. Under regular assumptions, we verify
that our cPI has an asymptotically valid coverage rate. We also demonstrate
that cPI based on the kernel method ensures a coverage rate with a high
probability when the sample size is large. Besides, with several conditions,
the cPI based on DNN works even with finite samples. A comprehensive simulation
study supports the usefulness of cPI, and the convincing performance of cPI
with a short sample is confirmed with two empirical datasets.

adjusts thresholds using revealed outcomes, ensuring finite-sample false
discovery rate (FDR)/marginal FDR control. Extending GAIF to online conformal
testing, we construct independent conformal $p$-values and introduce a
feedback-driven model selection criterion to identify the best model/score,
thereby improving statistical power. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods through numerical simulations and real-data applications.

Result: 模拟研究验证方法有效性，在真实阿尔茨海默病数据集展示应用。

Conclusion: MMG框架是有效的缺失数据插补方法，具有适应性和有效性。

Abstract: We introduce the Markov missing graph (MMG), a novel framework that imputes
missing data based on undirected graphs. MMG leverages conditional independence
relationships to locally decompose the imputation model. To establish the
identification, we introduce the Principle of Available Information (PAI),
which guides the use of all relevant observed data. We then propose a flexible
statistical learning paradigm, MMG Imputation Risk Minimization under PAI, that
frames the imputation task as an empirical risk minimization problem. This
framework is adaptable to various modeling choices. We develop theories of MMG,
including the connection between MMG and Little's complete-case missing value
assumption, recovery under missing completely at random, efficiency theory, and
graph-related properties. We show the validity of our method with simulation
studies and illustrate its application with a real-world Alzheimer's data set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键服务对网络依赖增加及超5G/6G网络复杂度提升，需要主动自动化网络故障管理，O - RAN带来新可能。

Method: 开发异常检测框架，提出两种算法：一是分析KPI识别高风险UE以主动切换；二是评估邻区覆盖质量过滤异常小区。

Result: 第二种算法平均减少41.27%的切换候选目标，方法运行快于近实时延迟约束。

Conclusion: 所提方法可缓解切换后故障和吞吐量下降，为6G自愈网络奠定基础。

Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure
coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks
necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The
provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN)
elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the
Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network
health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these
advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect
the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures.
We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world
deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of
severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs)
such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling
proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell
radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or
interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on
average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput
drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints.
This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.

Conclusion: 基于学习的方法能成功解决此前未解决的声音分离任务。

Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated
processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an
acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part
or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have
applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering
systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise
suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even
bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for
Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events
from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as
a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal
training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and
adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based
approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained
with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously
unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation
masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet
filtering on objective separation metrics.

Result: 综合对比实验显示该方法在数据不足条件下有效，下游任务用更少测量次数达到理想性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法能解决现有问题，在数据不足时表现良好，可应用于下游任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates continuous representations of steering vectors over
frequency and position of microphone and source for augmented listening (e.g.,
spatial filtering and binaural rendering) with precise control of the sound
field perceived by the user. Steering vectors have typically been used for
representing the spatial characteristics of the sound field as a function of
the listening position. The basic algebraic representation of steering vectors
assuming an idealized environment cannot deal with the scattering effect of the
sound field. One may thus collect a discrete set of real steering vectors
measured in dedicated facilities and super-resolve (i.e., upsample) them.
Recently, physics-aware deep learning methods have been effectively used for
this purpose. Such deterministic super-resolution, however, suffers from the
overfitting problem due to the non-uniform uncertainty over the measurement
space. To solve this problem, we integrate an expressive representation based
on the neural field (NF) into the principled probabilistic framework based on
the Gaussian process (GP). Specifically, we propose a physics-aware composite
kernel that model the directional incoming waves and the subsequent scattering
effect. Our comprehensive comparative experiment showed the effectiveness of
the proposed method under data insufficiency conditions. In downstream tasks
such as speech enhancement and binaural rendering using the simulated data of
the SPEAR challenge, the oracle performances were attained with less than ten
times fewer measurements.

Conclusion: 无需合成训练数据即可进行领域鲁棒的音频质量评估。

Abstract: We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of
generative audio, developed for Track 2 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025. The
task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production
Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by
text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A
main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic
evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained
transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long
short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based
sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results
show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling
domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.

Method: 提出结合SSL与手工特征的有效ASA方法，引入多边际序数损失函数联合建模分数序数和熟练度标签非均匀间隔。

Result: 在TEEMI语料库上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于强基线，且对未见提示泛化性好。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能解决现有ASA研究的局限性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on automated speaking assessment (ASA) has
benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, which capture
rich acoustic and linguistic patterns in non-native speech without underlying
assumptions of feature curation. However, speech-based SSL models capture
acoustic-related traits but overlook linguistic content, while text-based SSL
models rely on ASR output and fail to encode prosodic nuances. Moreover, most
prior arts treat proficiency levels as nominal classes, ignoring their ordinal
structure and non-uniform intervals between proficiency labels. To address
these limitations, we propose an effective ASA approach combining SSL with
handcrafted indicator features via a novel modeling paradigm. We further
introduce a multi-margin ordinal loss that jointly models both the score
ordinality and non-uniform intervals of proficiency labels. Extensive
experiments on the TEEMI corpus show that our method consistently outperforms
strong baselines and generalizes well to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: 量子非局域性是不确定性下近零误差决策的可靠资源。

Abstract: Claude Shannon's zero-error communication paradigm reshaped our understanding
of fault-tolerant information transfer. Here, we adapt this notion into game
theory with incomplete information. We ask: can players with private
information coordinate on a Nash equilibrium with zero probability of error? We
identify Bayesian games in which such coordination is impossible classically,
yet achievable by harnessing Bell nonlocal correlations. We formalize this
requirement as zero-error Nash equilibrium coordination, establishing a new
bridge between information theory, game theory, and quantum nonlocality.
Furthermore, we construct a tripartite Bayesian game that admits zero-error
Nash equilibrium coordination with genuine entanglement, and a two-player game
where a stronger notion of coordination can be achieved using every two-qubit
pure entangled state except the maximally one. Crucially, the advantage
persists under experimentally relevant noise, demonstrating nonlocality as a
robust resource for near-zero error decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding a static treasure in anonymous graphs
using oblivious agents and introduce a novel approach that leverages quantum
information. In anonymous graphs, vertices are unlabelled, indistinguishable,
and edges are locally labelled with port numbers. Agents typically rely on
stationary classical pebbles placed by an oracle to guide their search.
However, this classical approach is constrained by limited information
transmission and high traversal complexity. Classical pebbles are not
sufficient for search if the agents are oblivious. We propose the first use of
quantum pebbles for search in anonymous graphs. Quantum pebbles periodically
emit qubits in a fixed quantum state. Each pebble encodes the port number to
the next node using a unique quantum state. The agent determines the correct
path by performing measurements in multiple bases, exploiting the probabilistic
nature of quantum measurement to distinguish states. We show that this strategy
enables an oblivious agent to locate the treasure in $D$ steps using $D$
quantum pebbles, where $D$ is the length of the shortest path between the
starting point and the treasure. Moreover, only $O((\log D + \log \Delta)/(\log
1/\delta))$ measurements per node are required to ensure high success
probability in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ where $\delta =
\cos^2(\frac{\pi}{2\Delta})$. We propose the use of quantum information as a
guidance mechanism in anonymous graph search. We demonstrate that quantum
pebbles can not only emulate the functionality of classical pebbles but can do
so with improved efficiency, offering a promising direction for future
quantum-enhanced distributed algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum communication resources offer significant advantages for
fault-tolerant distributed protocols, particularly in Byzantine Agreement (BA),
where reliability against adversarial interference is essential. Quantum
Detectable Byzantine Agreement (QDBA) enables consensus protocols that surpass
classical limitations by leveraging entangled quantum states. In this work, we
focus on the practical realization of QDBA using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
pairs, the simplest maximally entangled quantum resources, making the protocol
experimentally accessible across current quantum hardware platforms. We present
a comprehensive computational study of the EPRQDBA protocol under realistic
quantum network conditions, utilizing the Aliro Quantum Network Simulator to
evaluate the performance and robustness of the protocol. Our simulations
systematically explore the protocol's parameter space --including variations in
network size, traitorous node count, the amount of entanglement consumed in the
protocol, and physically motivated noise models tailored specifically for
superconducting and photonic qubit technologies. Through extensive numerical
experiments, we provide insights into how these physically realistic parameters
impact protocol performance, establishing critical thresholds and optimal
operational regimes for experimental implementations. This work bridges
theoretical advances in quantum consensus protocols with practical network
implementations, offering a concrete reference for experimentalists. Our
findings serve as a guideline for evaluating and optimizing QDBA
implementations in realistic, noisy environments.

Result: 多数量子bug由算法或工作流多方面独特交互产生，调试策略与bug类别无明确关系。

Conclusion: 需进一步开展研究以开发有效且系统的量子调试策略。

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve in quality and scale, there is a
growing need for accessible software frameworks for programming them. However,
the unique behavior of quantum systems means specialized approaches, beyond
traditional software development, are required. This is particularly true for
debugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an
algorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often
requires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance
for quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main
challenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum
bugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and
supplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their
context, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While
classifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged
due to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or
workflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong,
which provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more
challenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that -
unexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and
bug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic
quantum debugging strategies.

Result: 初步数值测试表明，所提出的VQC模型在使用更少权重的情况下，比深度神经网络有更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的量子AC - PF框架为通过量子计算解决更复杂的电网任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or
power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems
navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work
leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF
solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models
that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to
accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first
contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear
least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it
using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is
to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the
resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third
contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF
quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.
Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain
enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much
fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for
addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.

Abstract: The multifaceted nature of disaster impact shows that densely populated areas
contribute more to aggregate burden, while sparsely populated but heavily
affected regions suffer disproportionately at the individual level. This study
introduces a framework for quantifying the societal impacts of power outages by
translating customer weighted outage exposure into deprivation measures,
integrating welfare metrics with three recovery indicators, average outage days
per customer, restoration duration, and relative restoration rate, computed
from sequential EAGLE I observations and linked to Zip Code Tabulation Area
demographics. Applied to four United States hurricanes, Beryl 2024 Texas,
Helene 2024 Florida, Milton 2024 Florida, and Ida 2021 Louisiana, this
standardized pipeline provides the first cross event, fine scale evaluation of
outage impacts and their drivers. Results demonstrate regressive patterns with
greater burdens in lower income areas, mechanistic analysis shows deprivation
increases with longer restoration durations and decreases with faster
restoration rates, explainable modeling identifies restoration duration as the
dominant driver, and clustering reveals distinct recovery typologies not
captured by conventional reliability metrics. This framework delivers a
transferable method for assessing outage impacts and equity, comparative cross
event evidence linking restoration dynamics to social outcomes, and actionable
spatial analyses that support equity informed restoration planning and
resilience investment.

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Method: 利用亚利桑那州凤凰城的自然驾驶数据集PHX，对三种城市驾驶场景进行对比分析，手动提取数据、用SIMEX方法处理误差、用DTW距离量化行为差异。

Result: 所有场景中PHX行为均超出WOMD范围，WOMD对短车头时距和急减速情况代表性不足。

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD建模需与独立收集数据进行验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Conclusion: 社会经济地位并非对所有患者在精神分裂症诊断上有保护作用，需更多关注健康差异量化，临床医生偏见与增加获得污名化诊断几率有关。

Abstract: In the United States, schizophrenia (SCZ) carries a race and sex disparity
that may be explained by clinician bias - a belief held by a clinician about a
patient that prevents impartial clinical decision making. The emergency
department (ED) is marked by higher rates of stress that lead to clinicians
relying more on implicit biases during decision making. In this work, we
considered a large cohort of psychiatric patients in the ED from the Mount
Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City to investigate the effects of
clinician bias on SCZ diagnosis while controlling for known risk factors and
patient sociodemographic information. Clinician bias was quantified as the
ratio of negative to total sentences within a patient's first ED note. We
utilized a logistic regression to predict SCZ diagnosis given patient race,
sex, age, history of trauma or substance use disorder, and the ratio of
negative sentences. Our findings showed that an increased ratio of negative
sentences is associated with higher odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.408 (1.361-1.456)]. Identifying as male [OR (95% CI)=1.112 (1.055-1.173)]
or Black [OR (95% CI)=1.081(1.031-1.133)] increased one's odds of being
diagnosed with SCZ. However, from an intersectional lens, Black female patients
with high SES have the highest odds of obtaining a SCZ diagnosis [OR (95%
CI)=1.629 (1.535-1.729)]. Results such as these suggest that SES does not act
as a protective buffer against SCZ diagnosis in all patients, demanding more
attention to the quantification of health disparities. Lastly, we demonstrated
that clinician bias is operational with real world data and related to
increased odds of obtaining a stigmatizing diagnosis such as SCZ.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a
new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group
$G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$.
Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average
$P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average
$(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with
respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence
properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic
variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in
general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$
are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la},
P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over
$(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric
interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific
$G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the
Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in
the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and
study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels
which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and
applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast
state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or
piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but
also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings,
achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform
distribution.

Result: 在三个著名ABMs上实验，使用VI实现显著性能提升和计算节省。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了ABMs研究复杂系统的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up
interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems
of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even
millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding
and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has
significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate
that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these
computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator
become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as
calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables
variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our
experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational
savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;
and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the
practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Abstract: We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject
interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to
evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation.
Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and
concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated
with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic
synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -
commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains
were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -
founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real
customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind
spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -
relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism
toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false
positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by
missing negative historical experiences.
  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas
constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive
and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of
lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical
studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -
capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and
clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.

Conclusion: CFD和物理信息AI方法构成动态、患者特定数字孪生基础，可优化放射栓塞规划并改善临床结果。

Abstract: Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers
radioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the
hepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while
minimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging
due to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in
microsphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins
may provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a
framework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine
learning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport
calculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which
enables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is
computationally expensive and limits clinical applicability.
  To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their
generative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate
governing equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the
neural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient
approximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed
generative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and
transformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally
resolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not
only maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow
scenarios, facilitating real-time decision support.
  Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic,
patient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and
ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: The MIDOG 2025 challenge extends prior work on mitotic figure detection by
introducing a new Track 2 on atypical mitosis classification. This task aims to
distinguish normal from atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images, a
clinically relevant but highly imbalanced and cross-domain problem. We
investigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on
ImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via
self-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.
1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate
class balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic
data. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong
performance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving
slightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.
Synthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the
organizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an
out-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4
percent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These
findings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable
for atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring
robustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive
synthetic balancing has limited benefit. Full hidden test set results will be
reported upon challenge completion.

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架能产生高检测F1分数，代码公开。

Abstract: MIDOG 2025 Track 1 requires mitosis detection in whole-slide images (WSIs)
containing non-tumor, inflamed, and necrotic regions. Due to the complicated
and heterogeneous context, as well as possible artifacts, there are often false
positives and false negatives, thus degrading the detection F1-score. To
address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework. Firstly, an improved
YOLO11x, integrated with EMA attention and LSConv, is employed to generate
mitosis candidates. We use a low confidence threshold to generate as many
proposals as possible, ensuring the detection recall. Then, a ConvNeXt-Tiny
classifier is employed to filter out the false positives, ensuring the
detection precision. Consequently, the proposed two-stage framework can
generate a high detection F1-score. Evaluated on a fused dataset comprising
MIDOG++, MITOS_WSI_CCMCT, and MITOS_WSI_CMC, our framework achieves an F1-score
of 0.882, which is 0.035 higher than the single-stage YOLO11x baseline. This
performance gain is produced by a significant precision improvement, from 0.762
to 0.839, and a comparable recall. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figure detection is a crucial task in computational pathology, as
mitotic activity serves as a strong prognostic marker for tumor aggressiveness.
However, domain variability that arises from differences in scanners, tissue
types, and staining protocols poses a major challenge to the robustness of
automated detection methods. In this study, we introduce SDF-YOLO (Single
Detect Focused YOLO), a lightweight yet domain-robust detection framework
designed specifically for small, rare targets such as mitotic figures. The
model builds on YOLOv11 with task-specific modifications, including a single
detection head aligned with mitotic figure scale, coordinate attention to
enhance positional sensitivity, and improved cross-channel feature mixing.
Experiments were conducted on three datasets that span human and canine tumors:
MIDOG ++, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT), and canine mammary
carcinoma (CMC). When submitted to the preliminary test set for the MIDOG2025
challenge, SDF-YOLO achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.799, with a
precision of 0.758, a recall of 0.775, an F1 score of 0.766, and an FROC-AUC of
5.793, demonstrating both competitive accuracy and computational efficiency.
These results indicate that SDF-YOLO provides a reliable and efficient
framework for robust mitotic figure detection across diverse domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图（AMFs）可靠检测因形态模糊和扫描仪差异具有挑战性，需有效方法。

Method: 研究UNI2 - h模型的三种变体，从LoRA基线开始，采用视觉提示调整（VPT），并结合测试时增强（TTA）与Vahadane和Macenko染色归一化。

Result: 最终提交在初步排行榜上平衡准确率达0.8837，ROC - AUC为0.9513，排名前10。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法结合染色归一化TTA为不同成像条件下非典型有丝分裂分类提供有效策略。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are clinically relevant indicators of
abnormal cell division, yet their reliable detection remains challenging due to
morphological ambiguity and scanner variability. In this work, we investigated
three variants of adapting the pathology foundation model UNI2-h for the
MIDOG2025 Track 2 challenge. Starting from a LoRA-based baseline, we found that
visual prompt tuning (VPT) substantially improved generalization, and that
further integrating test-time augmentation (TTA) with Vahadane and Macenko
stain normalization provided the best robustness. Our final submission achieved
a balanced accuracy of 0.8837 and an ROC-AUC of 0.9513 on the preliminary
leaderboard, ranking within the top 10 teams. These results demonstrate that
prompt-based adaptation combined with stain-normalization TTA offers an
effective strategy for atypical mitosis classification under diverse imaging
conditions.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of mortality, underscoring the
critical importance of precise diagnosis through X-ray angiography. Manual
coronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and
inefficient, prompting the development of automated models. However, existing
methods, whether rule-based or deep learning models, struggle with issues like
poor performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, current knowledge
distillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the
hierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and
insufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for
segmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep
Self-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation
that leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision. By combining Deep
Distribution Loss and Pixel-wise Self-knowledge Distillation Loss, our method
enhances the student model's segmentation performance through a hierarchical
learning strategy, effectively transferring knowledge from the teacher model.
Our method combines a loosely constrained probabilistic distribution vector
with tightly constrained pixel-wise supervision, providing dual regularization
for the segmentation model while also enhancing its generalization and
robustness. Extensive experiments on XCAD and DCA1 datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the dice coefficient, accuracy, sensitivity and IoU
compared to other models in comparative evaluations.
