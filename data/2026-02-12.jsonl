Improving these heuristics requires substantial engineering effort, and even when implemented, these heuristics often cannot take into account semantic correlations in queries and schemas that could enable better physical plans. Using our DBPlanBench harness for the DataFusion engine, we expose the physical plan through a compact serialized representation and let the LLM propose localized edits that can be applied and executed. We then apply an evolutionary search over these edits to refine candidates across iterations. Our key insight is that LLMs can leverage semantic knowledge to identify and apply non-obvious optimizations, such as join orderings that minimize intermediate cardinalities. We obtain up to 4.78$\\times$ speedups on some queries and we demonstrate a small-to-large workflow in which optimizations found on small databases transfer effectively to larger databases."}

LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs."}

We follow up on previous works that have analyzed the complexity of BNSL w.r.t. the so-called superstructure of the input. While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.\n  We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone. Last but not least, we show how our results can be extended to the closely related problem of Polytree Learning."}

In this article, we present ImprovEvolve, a simple yet effective technique for enhancing LLM-based evolutionary approaches such as AlphaEvolve. Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102."}

Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise."}

We analyse and compare the finite-time computational costs of schemes which learn a preconditioner based on the target covariance or the expected Hessian of the target potential with that of a corresponding scheme that does not use preconditioning. We apply our results to the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) for an appropriately regular target, establishing non-asymptotic guarantees for preconditioned ULA which learns its preconditioner. Our results are also applied to the unadjusted underdamped Langevin algorithm in the supplementary material. To do so, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the time taken to collect $N$ approximately independent samples from the target for schemes that learn their preconditioners under the assumption that the underlying Markov chain satisfies a contraction condition in the Wasserstein-2 distance. This approximate independence condition, that we formalize, allows us to bridge the non-asymptotic bounds of modern MCMC theory and classical heuristics of effective sample size and mixing time, and is needed to amortise the costs of learning a preconditioner across the many samples it will be used to produce."}

Yet diagnosing their performance and reliability is difficult because data are fragmented and time-disjoint, and existing methods demand large datasets and expert input while offering only limited insights. Degradation arises not only from shifting workloads and evolving architectures but also from environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration. We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that combines LLMs and KGs for full-spectrum SSD reasoning including Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and What-if analysis. We release the generated SSD-specific KG to advance reproducible research in knowledge-based storage system analysis. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Damrl-lab/KORAL"}

Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes."}

As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness."}

Despite the crucial role that these services play in meeting mobility needs, governments often do not account for these services or their underlying incentives when planning transit systems, which can significantly compromise system efficiency.\n  Against this backdrop, we develop a framework to analyze the incentives underlying informal and privatized transit systems, while proposing mechanisms to guide public transit operation and incentive design when a substantial share of mobility is provided by such profit-driven private operators. We introduce a novel, analytically tractable game-theoretic model of a fully privatized informal transit system with a fixed menu of routes, in which profit-maximizing informal operators (drivers) decide where to provide service and cost-minimizing commuters (riders) decide whether to use these services. Within this framework, we establish tight price of anarchy bounds which demonstrate that decentralized, profit-maximizing driver behavior can lead to bounded yet substantial losses in cumulative driver profit and rider demand served. We further show that these performance losses can be mitigated through targeted interventions, including Stackelberg routing mechanisms in which a modest share of drivers are centrally controlled, reflecting environments where informal operators coexist with public transit, and cross-subsidization schemes that use route-specific tolls or subsidies to incentivize drivers to operate on particular routes. Finally, we reinforce these findings through numerical experiments based on a real-world informal transit system in Nalasopara, India."}

Protein sequences, in particular, exemplify this structure, yet most generative artificial intelligence models implicitly assume a homogeneous data distribution. We show that this assumption fundamentally breaks down in heterogeneous biological sequence spaces: fixed global noise levels impose a destructive trade-off, either oversmoothing dense functional clusters or fragmenting sparse regions and producing non-functional hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce \\emph{Density-Dependent Smoothing} (DDS), a geometry-aware generative framework that adapts stochastic smoothing to the local density of the underlying sequence landscape. By inversely coupling diffusion noise to estimated sequence density, DDS enables gentle refinement in high-density functional regions while promoting controlled exploration across sparse regions. Implemented as a plug-in mechanism for discrete molecular sampling, DDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive models across antibody repertoires, therapeutic antibody design, antimicrobial peptide generation and coronavirus antibody design. Together, these results show that fixed global smoothing assumptions fundamentally limit generative modeling in sparse biological sequence spaces, and that geometry-aware smoothing removes this constraint, enabling reliable exploration and design previously unattainable with fixed-noise generative models."}

Requests arrive sequentially as node pairs. If the nodes lie in different clusters, the algorithm pays unit cost. After each request, the algorithm may migrate nodes between clusters at unit cost per node. This problem models datacenter resource allocation where virtual machines must be assigned to servers, balancing communication costs against migration overhead.\n  We study the variant where requests are restricted to edges of a ring network, an abstraction of ring-allreduce patterns in distributed machine learning. Despite this restriction, the problem remains challenging with an $Ω(n)$ deterministic lower bound. We present a randomized algorithm achieving $O(\\varepsilon^{-3} \\cdot \\log^2 n)$ competitive ratio using resource augmentation that allows clusters of size at most $(3/4 + \\varepsilon) \\cdot n$.\n  Our approach formulates the problem as a metrical task system with a restricted state space. By limiting the number of cut-edges (i.e., ring edges between clusters) to at most $2k$, where $k = Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, we reduce the state space from exponential to polynomial (i.e., $n^{O(k)}$). The key technical contribution is proving that this restriction increases cost by only a factor of $O(k)$. Our algorithm follows by applying the randomized MTS solution of Bubeck et al.

We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks.

In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints."}

Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics."}

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation."}

This shift is defined by a so-called distribution map. In the half-decade since, a literature has emerged which has, among other things, introduced new solution concepts to the original setup, extended the setup, offered new theoretical analyses, and examined the intersection of performative prediction and other established fields. In this survey, we first lay out the performative prediction setting and explain the different optimization targets: performative stability and performative optimality. We introduce a new way of classifying different performative prediction settings, based on how much information is available about the distribution map. We survey existing implementations of distribution maps and existing methods to address the problem of performative prediction, while examining different ways to categorize them. Finally, we point out known and previously unknown connections that can be drawn to other fields, in the hopes of stimulating future research."}

The goal is to identify an optimal subspace to project the observations onto that simultaneously maximizes between-group variation while minimizing within-group differences. The solution is straight forward when the number of observations is greater than the number of features but computational difficulties arise in both the high-dimensional setting, where there are more features than there are observations, and when the data are very large. Many works have proposed solutions for the high-dimensional setting and frequently involve additional assumptions or tuning parameters. We propose a fast and simple iterative algorithm for both classical and high-dimensional RRLDA on large data that is free from these additional requirements and that comes with guarantees. We also explain how RRLDA-RK provides implicit regularization towards the least norm solution without explicitly incorporating penalties. We demonstrate our algorithm on real data and highlight some results."}

Here we present a hybrid strategy combining the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory to efficiently decouple correlation effects. This approach confines static correlation to a compact multireference quantum state while recovering dynamic correlation through a classical on-top density functional using reduced-density information. By enabling self-consistent orbital optimization, the method significantly reduces quantum resource overheads without sacrificing physical rigor. We demonstrate chemical accuracy on standard benchmarks by reproducing C$_2$ equilibrium bond lengths and benzene excitation energies with mean absolute errors of 0.006 Å and 0.048 eV respectively. Most notably, for the strongly correlated Cr$_2$ dimer requiring a large complete active space (48e, 42o), the framework yields a bound potential-energy curve and recovers qualitative dissociation behavior despite realistic hardware noise. These results establish that separating correlation types provides a practical route to reliable predictions on near-term quantum hardware."}

We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics.

This method is particularly effective where standard Pseudo-Relevance Feedback fails due to poor initial recall. Crucially, our LLM is not fine-tuned for ToT or specific domains, demonstrating that gains stem from our prompting strategy rather than model specialization. Rewritten queries feed a multi-stage pipeline: sparse retrieval (BM25), dense/late-interaction reranking (Contriever, E5-large-v2, ColBERTv2), monoT5 cross-encoding, and list-wise reranking (Qwen 2.5 72B).

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

This paper presents an experience report on the conduction of a systematic mapping study with the support of LLMs, describing the steps followed, the necessary adjustments, and the main challenges faced. Positive aspects are discussed, such as (i) the significant reduction of time in repetitive tasks and (ii) greater standardization in data extraction, as well as negative aspects, including (i) considerable effort to build reliable well-structured prompts, especially for less experienced users, since achieving effective prompts may require several iterations and testing, which can partially offset the expected time savings, (ii) the occurrence of hallucinations, and (iii) the need for constant manual verification.

To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms."}

A natural formalization is the sequence-level power distribution $π_α(y\\mid x)\\propto p_θ(y\\mid x)^α$ ($α>1$), which concentrates mass on whole sequences instead of adjusting token-level temperature. Prior work shows that Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling from this distribution recovers strong reasoning performance, but at order-of-magnitude inference slowdowns. We introduce Power-SMC, a training-free Sequential Monte Carlo scheme that targets the same objective while remaining close to standard decoding latency. Power-SMC advances a small particle set in parallel, corrects importance weights token-by-token, and resamples when necessary, all within a single GPU-friendly batched decode. We prove that temperature $τ=1/α$ is the unique prefix-only proposal minimizing incremental weight variance, interpret residual instability via prefix-conditioned Rényi entropies, and introduce an exponent-bridging schedule that improves particle stability without altering the target.

We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures.

The framework is motivated by an optimal trading problem between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. In DEXs, traders control the distribution of the execution delay through the priority fee paid, introducing a fundamental trade-off between delays, uncertainty, and costs. We study the optimal trading problem of a trader exploiting trading signals in CEXs and DEXs.

Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide \"scale hints\": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$. For each type of hint, we establish pricing query complexity guarantees that are tight up to polylogarithmic factors for several classes of distributions, including monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, regular distributions, and general distributions."}

This shows that the exponential loss incurred by the BGS algorithm for the case of Alternating-Threshold polymorphisms is necessary, in contrast to the polynomial loss achievable for Majority polymorphisms.\n  For any Boolean PCSP that admits Majority polymorphisms, we give an algorithm satisfying $1-O(\\sqrtε)$ fraction of the weaker constraints when promised the existence of an assignment satisfying $1-ε$ fraction of the stronger constraints. This significantly generalizes the Charikar--Makarychev--Makarychev algorithm for 2-SAT, and matches the optimal trade-off possible under the UGC. The algorithm also extends, with the loss of an extra $\\log (1/ε)$ factor, to PCSPs on larger domains with a certain structural condition, which is implied by, e.g., a family of Plurality polymorphisms.\n  We prove that assuming the UGC, robust satisfiability is preserved under the addition of equality constraints. As a consequence, we can extend the rich algebraic techniques for decision/search PCSPs to robust PCSPs. The methods involve the development of a correlated and robust version of the general SDP rounding algorithm for CSPs due to (Brown-Cohen, Raghavendra, ICALP 2016), which might be of independent interest."}

Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications."}

To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation.

As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone. EvoCodeBench establishes a foundation for evaluating coding intelligence in evolving LLM-driven systems."}

Our model (ZNet) achieves this through an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs; it decomposes the ambient feature space into confounding and instrumental components, and is trained by enforcing empirical moment conditions corresponding to the defining properties of valid instruments (i.e., relevance, exclusion restriction, and instrumental unconfoundedness). Importantly, ZNet is compatible with a wide range of downstream two-stage IV estimators of causal effects. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they already exist in the ambient feature space and (ii) construct latent instruments in the embedding space when no explicit IVs are available. This suggests that ZNet can be used as a ``plug-and-play'' module for causal inference in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied."}

The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics."}

While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads.

Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions."}

To address this challenge, we develop a compact sequence-form proper equilibrium by redefining the expected payoffs over sequences, and we prove that it coincides with the normal-form proper equilibrium via strategic equivalence. To facilitate computation, we further introduce an alternative representation by defining a class of perturbed games based on an $\\varepsilon$-permutahedron over sequences. Building on this representation, we introduce two differentiable path-following methods for computing normal-form proper equilibria. These methods rely on artificial sequence-form games whose expected payoff functions incorporate logarithmic or entropy regularization through an auxiliary variable. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path induced by each artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form proper equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero.

It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques.\n  Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms. We believe our new criterion and perspective of looking for certified shortcuts can provide crucial guidance for designing efficient shortcut constructions in the future."}

However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline."}

FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making.

While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x. Additionally, one more instance becomes solvable by a method when combined with our preprocessing."}

While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems."}

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines."}

This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy.

This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming."}

The outcome of a centralized admission mechanism is then usually obtained by the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm with random tie-breaking. Therefore, every possible outcome of this mechanism is a stable solution for the coarse priorities that will arise with certain probability. This implies a probabilistic assignment, where the admission probability for each student-school pair is specified. In this paper, we propose a new efficiency-improving stable `smart lottery' mechanism. We aim to improve the probabilistic assignment ex-ante in a stochastic dominance sense, while ensuring that the improved random matching is still ex-post stable, meaning that it can be decomposed into stable matchings regarding the original coarse priorities. Therefore, this smart lottery mechanism can provide a clear Pareto-improvement in expectation for any cardinal utilities compared to the standard DA with lottery solution, without sacrificing the stability of the final outcome. We show that although the underlying computational problem is NP-hard, we can solve the problem by using advanced optimization techniques such as integer programming with column generation. We conduct computational experiments on generated and real instances. Our results show that the welfare gains by our mechanism are substantially larger than the expected gains by standard methods that realize efficiency improvements after ties have already been broken."}

We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures. The approach provides a data-grounded basis for layer-aware systemic-risk assessment and stress testing across multiple dimensions of the banking network."}

To address this, we propose ChainRec, an agentic recommender that uses a planner to dynamically select reasoning tools. ChainRec builds a standardized Tool Agent Library from expert trajectories. It then trains a planner using supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization to dynamically select tools, decide their order, and determine when to stop. Experiments on AgentRecBench across Amazon, Yelp, and Goodreads show that ChainRec consistently improves Avg HR@{1,3,5} over strong baselines, with especially notable gains in cold-start and evolving-interest scenarios.

In model-agnostic settings, SHAP uses the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly allocate credit to the features in a vector $X$ based on their contribution to an outcome $Y$. While the explanations offered by SHAP are local by nature, learners often need global measures of feature importance in order to improve model explainability and perform feature selection. The most common approach for converting these local explanations into global ones is to compute either the mean absolute SHAP or mean squared SHAP. However, despite their ubiquity, there do not exist approaches for performing statistical inference on these quantities.\n  In this paper, we take a semi-parametric approach for calibrating confidence in estimates of the $p$th powers of Shapley additive explanations. We show that, by treating the SHAP curve as a nuisance function that must be estimated from data, one can reliably construct asymptotically normal estimates of the $p$th powers of SHAP. When $p \\geq 2$, we show a de-biased estimator that combines U-statistics with Neyman orthogonal scores for functionals of nested regressions is asymptotically normal. When $1 \\leq p < 2$ (and the hence target parameter is not twice differentiable), we construct de-biased U-statistics for a smoothed alternative. In particular, we show how to carefully tune the temperature parameter of the smoothing function in order to obtain inference for the true, unsmoothed $p$th power. We complement these results by presenting a Neyman orthogonal loss that can be used to learn the SHAP curve via empirical risk minimization and discussing excess risk guarantees for commonly used function classes."}

Although the worst-case number of required altruists can be large, we show that in realistic settings only a small number is needed. We analyze two models of the compatibility graph, one based on random graphs and the other on compatibility types. When only pairwise exchanges are allowed, the number of required altruists is bounded by the maximum number of independent odd cycles, defined as disjoint odd cycles with no edges between them. This bound grows logarithmically with market size in the random graph model and is at most one third of the number of compatibility types in the type-based model. When small exchange cycles are allowed, it suffices for each participating organization to receive a number of altruists proportional to the number of compatibility types. Finally, simulations show that far fewer altruists are needed in practice than worst-case theory suggests."}

Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance."}

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods."}

Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue.

We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates.

Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the \"free fairness\" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health."}

They have become an important feature of compressed text indexes using space proportional to the number of Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) runs, often applied in genomics. This is in thanks not only to theoretical improvements over past approaches, but great cache efficiency and average case query time in practice. This is true even without using the worst case guarantees provided by the interval splitting balancing of the original result. In this paper, we show that an even simpler type of splitting, length capping by truncating long intervals, bounds the average move structure query time to optimal whilst obtaining a superior construction time than the traditional approach. This also proves constant query time when amortized over a full traversal of a single cycle permutation from an arbitrary starting position.\n  Such a scheme has surprising benefits both in theory and practice. We leverage the approach to improve the representation of any move structure with $r$ runs over a domain $n$ to $O(r \\log r + r \\log \\frac{n}{r})$-bits of space. The worst case query time is also improved to $O(\\log \\frac{n}{r})$ without balancing. An $O(r)$-time and $O(r)$-space construction lets us apply the method to run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) permutations such as LF and $φ$ to obtain optimal-time algorithms for BWT inversion and suffix array (SA) enumeration in $O(r)$ additional working space. Finally, we provide the RunPerm library, providing flexible plug and play move structure support, and use it to evaluate our splitting approach.

We present \\textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments.

To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks."}

We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework.

However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets.

Furthermore, prior works often leave open deviation incentive issues that arise when the centralised authority modifies agents' capacities.\n  We consider these issues in the Stable Fixtures problem model, which generalises many classical models through non-bipartite preferences and capacitated agents. We develop a formal framework to analyse and quantify agent incentives to adhere to computed matchings.

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components.

We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software."}

While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime."}

This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications.

We ask whether weakening optimality to the requirement that each player merely avoid worst responses -- arguably the weakest meaningful rationality criterion -- yields tractable solution concepts. We show that it does not: any solution concept with this minimal guarantee is ``as intractable'' as pure Nash equilibrium. In general games, determining the existence of no-worst-response action profiles is NP-complete, finding one is NP-hard, and counting them is #P-complete. In potential games, where existence is guaranteed, the search problem is PLS-complete. Computational intractability therefore stems not only from the requirement of optimality, but also from the requirement of a minimal rationality guarantee for each player. Moreover, relaxing the latter requirement gives rise to a tractability trade-off between the strength of individual rationality guarantees and the fraction of players satisfying them."}

However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets.

Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems."}

GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services.

In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance."}

Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem."}

Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes."}

Typically, blockchain protocols provide a timing buffer for block propagation across the network. In leader-based blockchains, the leader -- block proposer -- is known in advance for each slot. A fast (or low-latency) proposer may delay the block proposal in anticipation of more rewards from the transactions that would otherwise be included in the subsequent block. Deploying such a strategy by manipulating the timing is known as timing games. It increases the risk of missed blocks due to reduced time for other nodes to vote on the block, affecting the overall efficiency of the blockchain. Moreover, proposers who play timing games essentially appropriate MEV (additional rewards over transaction fees and the block reward) that would otherwise accrue to the next block, making it unfair to subsequent block proposers. We propose a double-block proposal mechanism, 2-Prop, to curtail timing games. 2-Prop selects two proposers per slot to propose blocks and confirms one of them. We design a reward-sharing policy for proposers based on how quickly their blocks propagate to avoid strategic deviations. In the induced game, which we call the Latency Game, we show that it is a Nash Equilibrium for the proposers to propose the block without delay under homogeneous network settings. Under heterogeneous network settings, we study many configurations, and our analysis shows that a faster proposer would prefer not to delay unless the other proposer is extremely slow. Thus, we show the efficacy of 2-Prop in mitigating the effect of timing games."}

While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads. We prove three convergence theorems under progressively relaxed synchronization: (1) Interleaving semantics with fair scheduling, (2) Parallel execution with update-only-on-change semantics (processes write only on those coordinates whose values change), and (3) Distributed execution with bounded staleness (updates propagate within $T$ rounds) and $i$-locality (each process modifies only its own component).\n  Our approach differs from prior work in fundamental ways: Cousot-Cousot's chaotic iteration uses join-based merges that preserve information. Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions."}

Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale.

Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment.

Under the classical model, a longstanding tension exists: Plurality, which suffers from the spoiler effect, achieves optimal $Θ(m^2)$ distortion among deterministic rules, while normatively superior rules like Copeland and Borda have unbounded distortion. We resolve this tension under probabilistic voting with the Plackett-Luce model, where rankings are noisy reflections of utilities governed by an inverse temperature parameter $β$. Copeland and Borda both achieve at most $β\\frac{1+e^{-β}}{1-e^{-β}}$ distortion, independent of the number of candidates $m$, and within a factor of 2 of the lower bound for randomized rules satisfying the probabilistic Condorcet loser criterion known from prior work. This improves upon the prior $O(β^2)$ bound for Borda. These upper bounds are nearly tight: prior work establishes a $(1-o(1))β$ lower bound for Borda, and we prove a $(1-ε)β$ lower bound for Copeland for any constant $ε>0$. In contrast, rules that rely only on top-choice information fare worse: Plurality has distortion $Ω(\\min(e^β, m))$ and Random Dictator has distortion $Θ(m)$. Additional `veto' information is also insufficient to remove the dependence on $m$; Plurality Veto and Pruned Plurality Veto have distortion $Ω(β\\ln m)$. We also prove a lower bound of $(\\frac{5}{8}-ε)β$ (for any constant $ε>0$) for all deterministic finite-precision tournament-based rules, a class that includes Copeland and any rule based on pairwise comparison margins rounded to fixed precision.

Recent work has introduced the paradigm of near-feasibility in capacitated matching settings, where agent capacities are slightly modified to ensure the existence of desirable outcomes.

Furthermore, prior works often leave open deviation incentive issues that arise when the centralised authority modifies agents' capacities.\n  We consider these issues in the Stable Fixtures problem model, which generalises many classical models through non-bipartite preferences and capacitated agents. We develop a formal framework to analyse and quantify agent incentives to adhere to computed matchings. Then, we embed near-feasible stable matchings in this framework and study the trade-offs between instability, capacity modifications, and computational complexity.

This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."}

Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts."}

Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data will serve a specific prediction task.\n  We develop a prediction-centric approach operating in three regimes depending on available structural knowledge. In the causal regime, when the causal parents of $Y$ are known and distribution shift is expected, we target the parents for robustness. In the graphical regime, when a Bayesian network structure is available and the distribution is stable, the Markov blanket of $Y$ provides a sufficient feature set for optimal prediction. In the predictive regime, when no structural knowledge exists, we select features via differentially private methods without claiming to recover causal or graphical structure.\n  We formalize this as PRISM, a mechanism that (i) identifies a predictive feature subset according to the appropriate regime, (ii) constructs targeted summary statistics, (iii) allocates budget to minimize an upper bound on prediction error, and (iv) synthesizes data via graphical-model inference. We prove end-to-end privacy guarantees and risk bounds. Empirically, task-aware allocation improves prediction accuracy compared to generic synthesizers. Under distribution shift, targeting causal parents achieves AUC $\\approx 0.73$ while correlation-based selection collapses to chance ($\\approx 0.49$)."}

However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization.

We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \\varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput.

The framework specifies when contributors should speak, what they should report, and when silence is preferable. Using simulation-based aggregation, we show that prediction accuracy improves over an all-own baseline across a broad region of the parameter space, conditional on items where routing applies. Importantly, these gains arise only when silence is allowed, enabling second-order signals to function effectively. The results demonstrate that collective intelligence in matters of taste depends on principled signal routing rather than simple averaging."}

In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines.

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."}

Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage.

A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states.

While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning.

However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision.

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline."}

We study this question in a controlled high-dimensional Gaussian setting, focusing on compositional target functions. We analyze their learnability using an explicit three-layer fitting model trained via layer-wise spectral estimators. Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies."}

Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the \"free fairness\" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health."}

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development."}

Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff."}

We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation."}

In this work, a rigorous probabilistic analysis of deep unbiased Leaky ReLU networks is provided. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the logarithm of the norm of network activations, establishing that, as the number of layers increases, their growth is governed by a parameter called the Lyapunov exponent. This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning."}

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement."}

Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase."}

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios."}

Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data.

Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction.

To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms."}

LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs."}

As these systems mature, they have the potential to automate a substantial share of manual organizational processes, fundamentally reshaping how work is designed, executed, and governed. Although many organizations have adopted AI to improve productivity, most implementations remain limited to isolated use cases and human-centered, tool-driven workflows. Despite increasing awareness of agentic AI's strategic importance, engineering teams and organizational leaders often lack clear guidance on how to operationalize it effectively. Key challenges include an overreliance on traditional software engineering practices, limited integration of business-domain knowledge, unclear ownership of AI-driven workflows, and the absence of sustainable human-AI collaboration models. Consequently, organizations struggle to move beyond experimentation, scale agentic systems, and align them with tangible business value. Drawing on practical experience in designing and deploying agentic AI workflows across multiple organizations and business domains, this paper proposes a pragmatic framework for transitioning organizational functions from manual processes to automated agentic AI systems. The framework emphasizes domain-driven use case identification, systematic delegation of tasks to AI agents, AI-assisted construction of agentic workflows, and small, AI-augmented teams working closely with business stakeholders. Central to the approach is a human-in-the-loop operating model in which individuals act as orchestrators of multiple AI agents, enabling scalable automation while maintaining oversight, adaptability, and organizational control."}

Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios."}

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge."}

To understand the behavior of AI agents in the agent-native community, in this paper, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Moltbook leveraging a dataset of 44,411 posts and 12,209 sub-communities (\"submolts\") collected prior to February 1, 2026. Leveraging a topic taxonomy with nine content categories and a five-level toxicity scale, we systematically analyze the topics and risks of agent discussions. Our analysis answers three questions: what topics do agents discuss (RQ1), how risk varies by topic (RQ2), and how topics and toxicity evolve over time (RQ3). We find that Moltbook exhibits explosive growth and rapid diversification, moving beyond early social interaction into viewpoint, incentive-driven, promotional, and political discourse. The attention of agents increasingly concentrates in centralized hubs and around polarizing, platform-native narratives. Toxicity is strongly topic-dependent: incentive- and governance-centric categories contribute a disproportionate share of risky content, including religion-like coordination rhetoric and anti-humanity ideology. Moreover, bursty automation by a small number of agents can produce flooding at sub-minute intervals, distorting discourse and stressing platform stability. Overall, our study underscores the need for topic-sensitive monitoring and platform-level safeguards in agent social networks."}

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%.

A typical dataset consists of triplets $(x, y^+, y^-)$, where response $y^+$ is preferred over response $y^-$ for context $x$. The Bradley--Terry (BT) model is the predominant approach, modeling preference probabilities as a function of latent score differences. Standard practice assumes data follows this model and learns the latent scores accordingly. However, real data may violate this assumption, and it remains unclear what BT learning recovers in such cases. Starting from triplet comparison data, we formalize the preference information it encodes through the conditional preference distribution (CPRD). We give precise conditions for when BT is appropriate for modeling the CPRD, and identify factors governing sample efficiency -- namely, margin and connectivity. Together, these results offer a data-centric foundation for understanding what preference learning actually recovers."}

Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost."}

Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \\textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction."}

While existing PPI proposals consider estimators arising from M-estimation, in this paper we generalize PPI to any regular asymptotically linear estimator. Furthermore, by situating PPI within the context of an existing rich literature on missing data and semi-parametric efficiency theory, we show that while PPI does not achieve the semi-parametric efficiency lower bound outside of very restrictive and unrealistic scenarios, it can be viewed as a computationally-simple alternative to proposals in that literature. We exploit connections to that literature to propose modified PPI estimators that can handle three distinct forms of covariate distribution shift. Finally, we illustrate these developments by constructing PPI estimators of true positive rate, false positive rate, and area under the curve via numerical studies."}

A major obstacle in realizing this potential is, however, the lack of curated, openly available datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing fusion datasets are scarce, fragmented across institutions, facility-specific, and inconsistently annotated, which limits reproducibility and prevents a fair and scalable comparison of AI approaches.

The benchmark includes a curated list of 14 tasks spanning a range of physical mechanisms, exploiting a variety of diagnostics and covering multiple target use cases. A baseline model is provided to facilitate transparent comparison and validation within a unified framework. By establishing a unified benchmark for both the fusion and AI-for-science communities, TokaMark aims to accelerate progress in data-driven plasma AI modeling, contributing to the broader goal of achieving sustainable and stable fusion energy.

Filtered Prediction-Powered Inference", "categories": ["math.ST", "stat.ML"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the generation of large-scale, low-cost predictions with increasingly high fidelity. As a result, the primary challenge in statistical inference has shifted from data scarcity to data reliability. Prediction-powered inference methods seek to exploit such predictions to improve efficiency when labeled data are limited. However, existing approaches implicitly adopt a use-all philosophy, under which incorporating more predictions is presumed to improve inference. When prediction quality is heterogeneous, this assumption can fail, and indiscriminate use of unlabeled data may dilute informative signals and degrade inferential accuracy. In this paper, we propose Filtered Prediction-Powered Inference (FPPI), a framework that selectively incorporates predictions by identifying a data-adaptive filtered region in which predictions are informative for inference. We show that this region can be consistently estimated under a margin condition, achieving fast rates of convergence. By restricting the prediction-powered correction to the estimated filtered region, FPPI adaptively mitigates the impact of biased or noisy predictions. We establish that FPPI attains strictly improved asymptotic efficiency compared with existing prediction-powered inference methods. Numerical studies and a real-data application to large language model evaluation demonstrate that FPPI substantially reduces reliance on expensive labels by selectively leveraging reliable predictions, yielding accurate inference even in the presence of heterogeneous prediction quality."}

In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring. Our research highlights how AgentTrace can enable more reliable agent deployment, fine-grained risk analysis, and informed trust calibration, thereby addressing critical concerns that have so far limited the use of LLM agents in sensitive environments."}

We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $μ$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $μ$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures."}

The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU.

The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training.

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement."}

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models."}

Existing defenses either reduce UI exposure, obfuscate only task-irrelevant content, or rely on user authorization, but none can protect task-critical sensitive information while preserving seamless agent usability.\n  We propose an anonymization-based privacy protection framework that enforces the principle of available-but-invisible access to sensitive data: sensitive information remains usable for task execution but is never directly visible to the cloud-based agent. Our system detects sensitive UI content using a PII-aware recognition model and replaces it with deterministic, type-preserving placeholders (e.g., PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c) that retain semantic categories while removing identifying details. A layered architecture comprising a PII Detector, UI Transformer, Secure Interaction Proxy, and Privacy Gatekeeper ensures consistent anonymization across user instructions, XML hierarchies, and screenshots, mediates all agent actions over anonymized interfaces, and supports narrowly scoped local computations when reasoning over raw values is necessary.\n  Extensive experiments on the AndroidLab and PrivScreen benchmarks show that our framework substantially reduces privacy leakage across multiple models while incurring only modest utility degradation, achieving the best observed privacy-utility trade-off among existing methods."}

In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance.

In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems."}

However, scalable algorithms for UOT, specifically those based on Gradient Descent (SGD), remain largely underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the semi-dual formulation of Entropic UOT and demonstrating its suitability for adaptive gradient methods. While the semi-dual is a standard tool for large-scale balanced OT, its geometry in the unbalanced setting appears ill-conditioned under standard analysis. Specifically, worst-case bounds on the marginal penalties using $χ^2$ divergence suggest a condition number scaling with $n/\\varepsilon$, implying poor scalability. In contrast, we show that the local condition number actually scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$, effectively removing the ill-conditioned dependence on $n$. Exploiting this property, we prove that SGD methods adapt to this local curvature, achieving a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\varepsilon T)$ in the stochastic and online regimes, making it suitable for large-scale and semi-discrete applications. Finally, for the full batch discrete setting, we derive a nearly tight upper bound on local smoothness depending solely on the gradient.

Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise."}

This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2.

We apply our results to the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) for an appropriately regular target, establishing non-asymptotic guarantees for preconditioned ULA which learns its preconditioner. Our results are also applied to the unadjusted underdamped Langevin algorithm in the supplementary material. To do so, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the time taken to collect $N$ approximately independent samples from the target for schemes that learn their preconditioners under the assumption that the underlying Markov chain satisfies a contraction condition in the Wasserstein-2 distance.

The framework specifies when contributors should speak, what they should report, and when silence is preferable. Using simulation-based aggregation, we show that prediction accuracy improves over an all-own baseline across a broad region of the parameter space, conditional on items where routing applies. Importantly, these gains arise only when silence is allowed, enabling second-order signals to function effectively.

We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions.

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.\n  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI."}

Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure."}

We compare direct question-level labeling with a Large Language Model (LLM) against a hybrid semi-supervised semantic labeling (SSSL) pipeline that clusters questions in embedding space, labels a small representative subset using an LLM, and propagates labels to remaining questions using k-Nearest Neighbors; we also compare downstream retrieval based on direct question similarity versus retrieval in the label space. We find that semantic labels can improve retrieval alignment when labels are discriminative and consistent, and that SSSL can generalize labels from a small labeled subset to large repositories while substantially reducing LLM usage and cost."}

The complete data distribution is unrestricted, while the missingness mechanism is assumed to factorize according to a conditional directed acyclic graph. Our approach follows an interventionist perspective in which missingness indicators are treated as variables that can be intervened on. A central challenge in this setting is that sequences of interventions on missingness indicators may induce and propagate selection bias, so that identification can fail even when a propensity score is invariant to available interventions. To address this challenge, we introduce a tree-based identification algorithm that explicitly tracks the creation and propagation of selection bias and determines whether it can be avoided through admissible intervention strategies. The resulting tree provides both a diagnostic and a constructive characterization of identifiability under a given missingness mechanism. Building on these results, we develop recursive inverse probability weighting procedures that mirror the intervention logic of the identification algorithm, yielding valid estimating equations for both the missingness mechanism and functionals of the complete data distribution. Simulation studies and a real-data application illustrate the practical performance of the proposed methods. An accompanying R package, flexMissing, implements all proposed procedures."}

As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions."}

Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a Föllmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of Föllmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schrödinger bridges and stochastic control.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations.

We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference.

We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations."}

Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention."}

While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning."}

However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone.

This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise.

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment."}

Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling."}

We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes."}

However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets.

We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation."}

We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production.

A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017.

A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts."}

In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation."}

Given an optimization problem, the standard approach is to evolve program code that, when executed, produces a solution close to the optimum. We propose an alternative program parameterization that maintains the ability to construct optimal solutions while reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. Specifically, we evolve a program (implementing, e.g., a Python class with a prescribed interface) that provides the following functionality: (1) propose a valid initial solution, (2) improve any given solution in terms of fitness, and (3) perturb a solution with a specified intensity. The optimum can then be approached by iteratively applying improve() and perturb() with a scheduled intensity. We evaluate ImprovEvolve on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: hexagon packing in a hexagon and the second autocorrelation inequality. For hexagon packing, the evolved program achieves new state-of-the-art results for 11, 12, 15, and 16 hexagons; a lightly human-edited variant further improves results for 14, 17, and 23 hexagons. For the second autocorrelation inequality, the human-edited program achieves a new state-of-the-art lower bound of 0.96258, improving upon AlphaEvolve's 0.96102."}

Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias."}

Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs \"slow-in\" and \"fast-out\" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows."}

We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality.

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training."}

While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.\n  We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone.

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning."}

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME.

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself."}

To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments.

Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

This challenge is relevant for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis. We investigated whether specificity deficits in foundation models are associated with heterogeneity in the negative class. Methods: This retrospective study used the multi-institutional, RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (2019-2023), comprising scans from 23 centres. Two foundation models (MedCLIP, zero-shot; RadDINO, linear probe) were compared against three task-specific approaches (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Models were trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence) and evaluated on an enriched 100-patient test set. To isolate negative-class effects, specificity was assessed in patients without bowel injury who had concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) versus no abdominal pathology (n=50). Results: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination to task-specific models (AUC, 0.64-0.68 versus 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models demonstrated high specificity in patients without abdominal pathology (84-100%). When solid organ injuries were present, specificity declined substantially for foundation models (50-51 percentage points) compared with smaller reductions of 12-41 percentage points for task-specific models. Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased progressively with labelled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation."}

We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness.

The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC).

Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained."}

Many existing approaches to constructing post-training data quantify diversity using text-based metrics that capture linguistic variation, but such metrics provide only weak signals for the task-relevant features that determine downstream performance. In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer. Our work provides a solid and practical methodology for exploring data-centric optimization of LLMs."}

Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors.

This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery."}

We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models."}

The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting."}

Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA.

To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy.

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement."}

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed.

We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines."}

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks."}

In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model.

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data."}

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows."}

However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm.

To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph.

This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold.

A version of this work was accepted and presented at the 1st Workshop on Epistemic Intelligence in Machine Learning (EIML) at EurIPS 2025", "summary": "State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks."}

To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments."}

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean."}

Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings. LHAW provides the first systematic framework for cost-sensitive evaluation of agent clarification behavior in long-horizon settings, enabling development of reliable autonomous systems."}

We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability.

Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis."}

Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data."}

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication."}

To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $μ$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $μ$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures."}

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures."}

To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance.

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator.

Interpreting ECGs is inherently challenging, and diagnostic accuracy can vary depending on the interpreter's experience. Although echocardiography provides rich diagnostic information, it requires specialized equipment and personnel, limiting its availability. In this study, we focus on constructing a robust ECG encoder for multimodal pretraining using real world hospital data. We employ SigLIP, a CLIP based model with a sigmoid based loss function enabling multi label prediction, and introduce a modified loss function tailored to the multi label nature of ECG data. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating medical knowledge in the language model and applying the modified loss significantly improve multi label ECG classification. To further enhance performance, we increase the embedding dimensionality and apply random cropping to mitigate data drift.

Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs.

In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy."}

Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration."}

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR."}

This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems.

All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns.

To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates.

BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning.

This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead.

We explore the resolution of the long-standing sharp growth rate conjecture in Schauder theory, achieved by Cristiana De Filippis and Giuseppe Mingione, which identifies the exact threshold $q/p < 1 + α/n$ for gradient Hölder continuity. Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems."}

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases."}

Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies.

These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds.

While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations.

With the emergence of natural-sounding neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, several commercial services have been developed to leverage these technology for converting standard text e-books into high-quality narrated e-books. However, no open-source solutions currently exist to perform this task. In this paper, we present Calliope, an open-source framework designed to fill this gap. Our method leverages state-of-the-art open-source TTS to convert a text e-book into a narrated e-book in the EPUB 3 Media Overlay format. The method offers several innovative steps: audio timestamps are captured directly during TTS, ensuring exact synchronization between narration and text highlighting; the publisher's original typography, styling, and embedded media are strictly preserved; and the entire pipeline operates offline. This offline capability eliminates recurring API costs, mitigates privacy concerns, and avoids copyright compliance issues associated with cloud-based services. The framework currently supports the state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems XTTS-v2 and Chatterbox. A potential alternative approach involves first generating narration via TTS and subsequently synchronizing it with the text using forced alignment.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics."}

We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation."}

Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates.

We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis."}

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines."}

On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation."}

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures."}

The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau)."}

As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster).

To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios.

First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality.

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR."}

Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset.

We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size.

We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $δ(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions.

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime.

We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail."}

Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications."}

The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence."}

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%.

We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS.

In public sector and civic AI systems, community contributions such as deliberations, annotations, prompts, and incident reports are often recorded informally, weakly linked to system updates, and disconnected from enforceable rights or sustained compensation. As a result, participation is frequently symbolic rather than accountable. We introduce the Participation Ledger, a machine readable and auditable framework that operationalizes participation as traceable influence, enforceable authority, and compensable labor. The ledger represents participation as an influence graph that links contributed artifacts to verified changes in AI systems, including datasets, prompts, adapters, policies, guardrails, and evaluation suites. It integrates three elements: a Participation Evidence Standard documenting consent, privacy, compensation, and reuse terms; an influence tracing mechanism that connects system updates to replayable before and after tests, enabling longitudinal monitoring of commitments; and encoded rights and incentives. Capability Vouchers allow authorized community stewards to request or constrain specific system capabilities within defined boundaries, while Participation Credits support ongoing recognition and compensation when contributed tests continue to provide value. We ground the framework in four urban AI and public space governance deployments and provide a machine readable schema, templates, and an evaluation plan for assessing traceability, enforceability, and compensation in practice."}

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior."}

We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience."}

To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction."}

We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training."}

ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles."}

Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding.

Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise."}

While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning.

In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off."}

In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming."}

Perturbations targeting the same gene can produce different transcriptional responses depending on their genomic locus, including different transcription start sites and regulatory elements. Gene-level perturbation models collapse these distinct interventions into the same representation.\n  We introduce STRAND, a generative model that predicts single-cell transcriptional responses by conditioning on regulatory DNA sequence. STRAND represents a perturbation by encoding the sequence at its genomic locus and uses this representation to parameterize a conditional transport process from control to perturbed cell states. Representing perturbations by sequence, rather than by a fixed set of gene identifiers, supports zero-shot inference at loci not seen during training and expands inference-time genomic coverage from ~1.5% for gene-level single-cell foundation models to ~95% of the genome.\n  We evaluate STRAND on CRISPR perturbation datasets in K562, Jurkat, and RPE1 cells. STRAND improves discrimination scores by up to 33% in low-sample regimes, achieves the best average rank on unseen gene perturbation benchmarks, and improves transfer to novel cell lines by up to 0.14 in Pearson correlation. Ablations isolate the gains to sequence conditioning and transport, and case studies show that STRAND resolves functionally alternative transcription start sites missed by gene-level models."}

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline."}

Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely.

EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations.

CVPL represents linkage analysis as an operator pipeline comprising blocking, vectorization, latent projection, and similarity evaluation, yielding continuous, scenario-dependent risk estimates rather than binary compliance verdicts. We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns.

This shift is defined by a so-called distribution map. In the half-decade since, a literature has emerged which has, among other things, introduced new solution concepts to the original setup, extended the setup, offered new theoretical analyses, and examined the intersection of performative prediction and other established fields. In this survey, we first lay out the performative prediction setting and explain the different optimization targets: performative stability and performative optimality. We introduce a new way of classifying different performative prediction settings, based on how much information is available about the distribution map. We survey existing implementations of distribution maps and existing methods to address the problem of performative prediction, while examining different ways to categorize them.

Existing accelerators, such as Groq and Cerebras, mitigate off-chip traffic with large on-chip caches, while algorithmic innovations such as FlashAttention fuse operators to avoid materializing large attention matrices. However, as off-chip traffic decreases, our measurements show that on-chip SRAM accesses account for over 60% of energy in long-sequence workloads, making cache access the new bottleneck. We propose 3D-Flow, a hybrid-bonded, 3D-stacked spatial accelerator that enables register-to-register communication across vertically partitioned PE tiers. Unlike 2D multi-array architectures limited by NoC-based router-to-router transfers, 3D-Flow leverages sub-10 um vertical TSVs to sustain cycle-level operator pipelining with minimal overhead. On top of this architecture, we design 3D-FlashAttention, a fine-grained scheduling method that balances latency across tiers, forming a bubble-free vertical dataflow without on-chip SRAM roundtrips. Evaluations on Transformer workloads (OPT and QWEN models) show that our 3D spatial accelerator reduces 46-93% energy consumption and achieves 1.4x-7.6x speedups compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D designs."}

However, these two paths exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we present ACE-RTL that unifies both directions through Agentic Context Evolution (ACE). ACE-RTL integrates an RTL-specialized LLM, trained on a large-scale dataset of 1.7 million RTL samples, with a frontier reasoning LLM through three synergistic components: the generator, reflector, and coordinator. These components iteratively refine RTL code toward functional correctness. We further introduce a parallel scaling strategy that significantly reduces the number of iterations required to reach correct solutions. On the Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems (CVDP) benchmark, ACE-RTL achieves up to a 44.87% pass rate improvement over 14 competitive baselines while requiring only four iterations on average."}

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines."}

We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management."}

A natural formalization is the sequence-level power distribution $π_α(y\\mid x)\\propto p_θ(y\\mid x)^α$ ($α>1$), which concentrates mass on whole sequences instead of adjusting token-level temperature. Prior work shows that Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling from this distribution recovers strong reasoning performance, but at order-of-magnitude inference slowdowns. We introduce Power-SMC, a training-free Sequential Monte Carlo scheme that targets the same objective while remaining close to standard decoding latency. Power-SMC advances a small particle set in parallel, corrects importance weights token-by-token, and resamples when necessary, all within a single GPU-friendly batched decode. We prove that temperature $τ=1/α$ is the unique prefix-only proposal minimizing incremental weight variance, interpret residual instability via prefix-conditioned Rényi entropies, and introduce an exponent-bridging schedule that improves particle stability without altering the target. On MATH500, Power-SMC matches or exceeds MH power sampling while reducing latency from $16$--$28\\times$ to $1.4$--$3.3\\times$ over baseline decoding."}

Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap.

Inference-Time Scaling in Language Models as Adaptive Resource Rationality", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself."}

Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets."}

LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs."}

While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings."}

Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning.

Our theory yields a simple closed-form structure for the fixed-potential subset update: depending on the mass-entropy trade-off, the optimal crop either collapses to a single token or takes the form of a one-dimensional prefix that can be found efficiently with a linear scan. We implement Top-W using efficient geometry-based potentials (nearest-set or k-NN) and pair it with an alternating decoding routine that keeps the standard truncation-and-sampling interface unchanged. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (GSM8K, GPQA, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench) across three instruction-tuned models show that Top-W consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art decoding approaches achieving up to 33.7% improvement.

To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks."}

The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters.

Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $ΔR^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $μ= 3.74 \\pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($μ= 3.93$) and coherence ($μ= 4.25$) as the strongest criteria.

Our model (ZNet) achieves this through an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs; it decomposes the ambient feature space into confounding and instrumental components, and is trained by enforcing empirical moment conditions corresponding to the defining properties of valid instruments (i.e., relevance, exclusion restriction, and instrumental unconfoundedness). Importantly, ZNet is compatible with a wide range of downstream two-stage IV estimators of causal effects. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they already exist in the ambient feature space and (ii) construct latent instruments in the embedding space when no explicit IVs are available. This suggests that ZNet can be used as a ``plug-and-play'' module for causal inference in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied."}

This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring.

This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences.

However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline."}

Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to stratify nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead."}

UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems."}

To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning.

In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data.

Prior work has established tight query complexity bounds for learning a near-optimal price with additive error $\\varepsilon$ when the valuation distribution is supported on $[0,1]$. However, our understanding of how to learn a near-optimal price that achieves at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue remains limited.\n  In this paper, we study the pricing query complexity of the single-buyer revenue maximization problem under such multiplicative error guarantees in several settings. Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide \"scale hints\": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$.

In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance.

We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance.

In model-agnostic settings, SHAP uses the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly allocate credit to the features in a vector $X$ based on their contribution to an outcome $Y$. While the explanations offered by SHAP are local by nature, learners often need global measures of feature importance in order to improve model explainability and perform feature selection. The most common approach for converting these local explanations into global ones is to compute either the mean absolute SHAP or mean squared SHAP. However, despite their ubiquity, there do not exist approaches for performing statistical inference on these quantities.\n  In this paper, we take a semi-parametric approach for calibrating confidence in estimates of the $p$th powers of Shapley additive explanations. We show that, by treating the SHAP curve as a nuisance function that must be estimated from data, one can reliably construct asymptotically normal estimates of the $p$th powers of SHAP. When $p \\geq 2$, we show a de-biased estimator that combines U-statistics with Neyman orthogonal scores for functionals of nested regressions is asymptotically normal.

On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s."}

This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality."}

We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework. With the expressive capacity of diffusion models, our method facilitates both efficient sampling from high-dimensional or multimodal distributions and accurate nonparametric estimation. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. In particular, we derive optimal end-to-end convergence rates in the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target conditional distributions. Building on this foundation, we further establish the convergence guarantees of the resulting bootstrap procedure.

Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos."}

To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks."}

However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher."}

These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction.

While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty."}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets.

The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models."}

To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency.

The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field."}

Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies."}

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width.

Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a Föllmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of Föllmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schrödinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense."}

Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming."}

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies."}

We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes.

In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass.

We apply SCRAPL to differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), specifically, unsupervised sound matching of a granular synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. We also propose an initialization heuristic based on importance sampling, which adapts SCRAPL to the perceptual content of the dataset, improving neural network convergence and evaluation performance. We make our code and audio samples available and provide SCRAPL as a Python package."}

This interest, combined with the commoditization of actuators, has propelled growth in low-cost robotic platforms. However, the optimal form factor for mobile manipulation, especially on a budget, remains an open question. We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/"}
