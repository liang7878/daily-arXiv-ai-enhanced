By operating on 0/1\nspikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate\noperations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for\nmore efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating\nand simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and\nSpiNNaker.

Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve\nas a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many\nproposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN\ntopology.

Targeting\nany-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a\nsynaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes.

Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to\nfacilitate further research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u9010\u5c42\u589e\u957f\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5f00\u53d1\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u548c\u9010\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u9010\u5c42\u5806\u53e0\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u5c42\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u9010\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5177\u751f\u7269\u6027\u6216\u6784\u5efa\u6027\u7684AI\u5f00\u53d1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u7b49\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A key feature of our\ncontribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework\nthat generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our\nsimulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on\nthe assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the\nleast-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each\nstate along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential\nand leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments\nand have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We\nanalytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying\nenergy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how\npopulations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been\nobserved empirically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5728\u4ee3\u8c22\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d7\u4ee3\u8c22\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6709\u2018\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7406\u8bba\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684 firing rate homeostasis \u548c\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u5230\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5206\u6563\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7fa4\u4f53\u8c03\u8c10\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7fa4\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d ATP \u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u795e\u7ecf\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u4ee3\u8c22\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Mathematically,\nthis is accomplished by solving a backward dynamic programming problem\nassociated with optimizing the discounted risk-neutral expectation of cash\nflows from the contract. Furthermore, reflecting traded VA contracts in the\nmarket, we consider hybrid products providing policyholders access to a cash\nfund which functions as an intermediate repository of earnings from the VA and\nearns interest at a contractually specified cash rate. We contribute to the\nliterature by revealing several significant interactions among taxation, the\ncash fund, and the benefit base update mechanism. When tax rates are high, the\ntax-shielding effect of the cash fund, which is taxed differently from ordinary\nwithdrawals from the VA, plays a significant role in enhancing the\nattractiveness of the overall contract. Furthermore, the ratchet benefit base\nupdate scheme (in contrast to the ubiquitous return-of-premium specification in\nthe literature) tends to discourage early surrender as it provides enhanced\ndownside market risk protection.

The local clustering\ncoefficient, and the more recently introduced, local closure coefficient,\ncapture powerful properties that are essential in a large number of\napplications, ranging from graph embeddings to graph partitioning. Such\ncoefficients capture the local density of the neighborhood of each node,\nconsidering incident triadic structures and paths of length two. For this\nreason, we refer to these coefficients collectively as local triadic\ncoefficients.\n  In this work, we consider the novel problem of computing efficiently the\naverage of local triadic coefficients, over a given partition of the nodes of\nthe input graph into a set of disjoint buckets. The average local triadic\ncoefficients of the nodes in each bucket provide a better insight into the\ninterplay of graph structure and the properties of the nodes associated to each\nbucket. Unfortunately, exact computation, which requires listing all triangles\nin a graph, is infeasible for large networks. Hence, we focus on obtaining\nhighly-accurate probabilistic estimates.\n  We develop Triad, an adaptive algorithm based on sampling, which can be used\nto estimate the average local triadic coefficients for a partition of the nodes\ninto buckets. Triad is based on a new class of unbiased estimators, and\nnon-trivial bounds on its sample complexity, enabling the efficient computation\nof highly accurate estimates.

The impressive\ncapabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this\nquestion is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still\nfrequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we\nseek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize\nover tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data\nand model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds\nacross different task encodings as long as the training distribution\nsufficiently covers the task space.

However, there is an inherent bias in the clicks of users due\nto position bias, i.e., users are more likely to click highly-ranked documents\nthan low-ranked documents. To address this bias when training LTR models, many\napproaches from the literature re-weight the users' click data using Inverse\nPropensity Scoring (IPS). IPS re-weights the user's clicks proportionately to\nthe position in the historical ranking that a document was placed when it was\nclicked since low-ranked documents are less likely to be seen by a user. In\nthis paper, we argue that low-ranked documents that are similar to\nhighly-ranked relevant documents are also likely to be relevant. Moreover,\naccounting for the similarity of low-ranked documents to highly ranked relevant\ndocuments when calculating IPS can more effectively mitigate the effects of\nposition bias. Therefore, we propose an extension to IPS, called IPSsim, that\ntakes into consideration the similarity of documents when estimating IPS. We\nevaluate our IPSsim estimator using two large publicly available LTR datasets\nunder a number of simulated user click settings, and with different numbers of\ntraining clicks.

Specifically, SP4LP first\napplies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the\nshortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting\nsequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP\nto capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational\nefficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nlink prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more\nexpressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art\nstructural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled\napproach for link prediction in graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSP4LP\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u8282\u70b9\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u4e8e\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u5728\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u94fe\u8def\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u8df3\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u4f7f\u7528GNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u63d0\u53d6\u5019\u9009\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u95f4\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "SP4LP\u5728\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eSP4LP\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012GNN\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u56fe\u4e2d\u94fe\u8def\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a\nblock of layers of the network from the device to a server.

A\nlightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the\ndevice and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single\ntransfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere\nmitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations\ngenerated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to\nSFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations.

To address this gap, we study\nArabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from\nreal-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of\nlanguages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently\nand uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ.

While existing\nN-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order\ncomparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on\ntask-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,\nwe propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk\nminimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to\nenhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation\nprocesses of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic\nformulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk\nestimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We\nfurther establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support.

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving.

The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics.

We also propose a\nhierarchical memory model that combines local and pooled memory, and evaluate\nlightweight CXL implementations, HBM, and silicon photonics for efficient\nscaling.

Our work studies the\nalignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of\nunsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the\ninput prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after\ngeneration. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering\nboth prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there\nare no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful\nbehavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable\nfrom benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies\na natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All\nof our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions.

As perhaps the most\nwidely used interpolation methods, geostatistical models -- such as Ordinary\nKriging (OK) -- assume spatial stationarity, which makes it difficult to\ncapture the nonstationary characteristics of geographic variables.

Recent advances in dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to\nidentify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this\nidea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to\nlearn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these\nmethods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable\noperations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value\ndecomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can\nintroduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning\nthe top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical\nsystems based on the idea of low-rank approximation.

For example,\ncomputational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning\ntechniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would\nenable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty\nquantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such\napproach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack\nnucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques\nhave shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely\non overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the\nfracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark\nand advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three\nenergy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial\ncrack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100\ntime steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction.

Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based\nregret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based\ndetectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects.

In this review, we\ndiscuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications\nof those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.\nWhile many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect\nthat the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the\ncoming years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPMs\uff09\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u867d\u591a\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u6210\u719f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u70b9\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5b8c\u5168\u5229\u7528\uff0cGPMs\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8ba8\u8bbaGPMs\u57fa\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u539f\u5219\u5e76\u56de\u987e\u5176\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9GPMs\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u589e\u52a0\u5c06\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5e74\u6210\u719f\u3002"}}

The demand for real-time AD has surged\nwith the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of\nmultivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD\nrequires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also\noperate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical\ninstances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We\npropose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for\nmultivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.\nUnlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that\nprocess entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors\nthe correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling\nefficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking\npractices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy\ntailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios.

The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of\nIoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both\nprivacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)\noffers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without\nexposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx\noften fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and\nnon-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint\nmalware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E\n(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports\nindirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.\nEach client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact\nsummaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to\nclients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based\naugmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than\nrelying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables\nclients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns\nobserved across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.\nThis targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity\nwith minimal communication overhead.

In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown\npromising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns\nwithin the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor\ngeneralizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high\nvariability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by\ndeveloping new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces\nTransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's\ndisease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet\nstructure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This\ntokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific\nfeatures, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention\nlayers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public\ndatasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were\nharmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out\n(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison\nagainst seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG\nachieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest\ninterquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions.

Traditional approaches often rely on a single data\nmodality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for\nsurvival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks\nscenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources\non survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal\nVariational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for\nsurvival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,\nfour molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages\nmodality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,\nenabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific\ninformation. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically\nmeaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific\ninsights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed\nclinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,\ndata-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer\ncohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,\ndimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results\ndemonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard\nsurvival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets.

Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates\ntask conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM\ninto MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and\nindividual task gradients-referred to as global and local\ninformation-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,\ndirectly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and\nmemory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight\n\\textbf{S}harpness-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{M}ulti-task \\textbf{O}ptimization\napproach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local\nperturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise\nnormalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of\nmulti-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our\nmethod.

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the\nMultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document\ncorpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable\nimprovements over common naive RAG implementations.

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they\nadequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large\nlanguage model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better\nand even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space\ngreatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained\nmodules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample\nfrom math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a\nfixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same\nlayer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic\narchitectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution.

This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)\nacross three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,\nEUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM\nexhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version\nof TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained\nversion achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and\n15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's\nzero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting\nand equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can\nsurpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model\nconsistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable\nperformance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant\nsample-efficiency gains.

Most rely on flat, narrowly\nscoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,\nand reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we\nintroduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future\nof AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language\nmodels to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings.

In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference\nOptimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion\nmodels by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the\nsame optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to\njustify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to\nvalidate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic\nmetrics.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).
