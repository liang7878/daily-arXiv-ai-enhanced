### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将符号回归（SR）应用于矩形通道3D不可压缩层流建模，用PySR库从数值模拟数据导出符号方程，还提出SR与ASP结合的混合框架，强调SR简化复杂流动和知识表示方法提升模型可靠性的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解潜在流动物理与准确预测同样重要，SR可揭示复杂物理系统中可解释的数学关系，因此开展本研究。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据导出符号方程；提出将SR与答案集编程（ASP）的知识表示框架相结合的创新方法。

Result: 导出的符号方程能近似抛物线速度分布和压力降，与文献中的解析解完全吻合；混合SR/ASP框架确保生成的符号表达式统计准确且物理合理。

Conclusion: SR能将复杂流动行为简化为简洁、可解释的方程；知识表示方法可提高数据驱动的SR模型与领域原则的可靠性和一致性，为将混合方法集成到高效框架铺平道路。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有数据分析代理系统忽视结构化推理过程，本文提出I2I - STRADA架构，评估显示其性能优于先前系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在数据分析中忽视结构化推理过程，而现实数据分析需要一致的认知工作流程。

Method: 引入I2I - STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务建模分析过程，反映分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I - STRADA在规划连贯性和洞察一致性方面优于先前系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流程在数据分析的代理设计中很重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高级规划系统（APS）因顾问定制和维护成本高，使许多客户望而却步，为满足供应链规划师对更易获取APS的需求。

Method: 构建基于工具增强大语言模型的对话系统SmartAPS。

Result: 为运营规划师提供直观自然语言聊天界面，可查询信息、进行反事实推理、获取建议和执行情景分析。

Conclusion: SmartAPS能帮助运营规划师更好地管理运营。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

### [4] [Synthesis of timeline-based planning strategies avoiding determinization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17988)
*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文识别定性时间线规划的一个片段，其规划存在问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空问题以合成策略，还找出适配该确定性片段的Allen关系最大子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定性时间线规划通过非确定性有限自动机证明PSPACE成员资格，但无法直接用于合成规划策略，需昂贵的确定化步骤。

Method: 识别定性时间线规划的特定片段，将其规划存在问题映射到确定性有限自动机的非空问题；找出适配的Allen关系最大子集。

Result: 找到了可直接映射到确定性有限自动机非空问题的定性时间线规划片段，以及适配的Allen关系最大子集。

Conclusion: 解决了定性时间线规划中策略合成的问题，可利用确定性有限自动机直接合成策略。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出E.A.R.T.H.框架将模型错误转化为创意资产，提升AI创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI如何从模仿走向真正的创造力。

Method: 提出E.A.R.T.H.五阶段生成管道，结合认知科学和生成建模，使用多种模型和复合奖励函数。

Result: 在优化阶段创造力得分提升52.5%，最终输出提升70.4%，精炼标语更短、更新颖，跨模态测试对齐良好，人类评估60%输出得分≥4.0。

Conclusion: 以错误为中心、反馈驱动的生成方式能增强创造力，为实现自我进化、符合人类需求的创意AI提供可扩展途径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

### [6] [Does visualization help AI understand data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18022)
*Victoria R. Li,Johnathan Sun,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现AI系统如GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5处理数据时，散点图能提升其描述准确性，表明AI可从可视化中受益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究图表对AI系统处理数据是否有用。

Method: 对GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5两个商业视觉 - 语言模型进行三组代表性分析任务实验，并设置提供空白图表和数据不匹配图表的基线进行对比。

Result: 当原始数据配有散点图时，两个系统能更精确准确地描述合成数据集，尤其是数据复杂度增加时，且性能提升源于图表内容。

Conclusion: AI系统能像人类一样从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MAGPO框架用于多智能体强化学习，理论证明并实验验证其性能优于CTDE基线和全集中式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法存在未充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证的问题。

Method: 提出MAGPO框架，结合集中式指导与分散式执行，使用自回归联合策略进行探索并与分散式策略对齐。

Result: 在6个不同环境的43个任务上实验，MAGPO始终优于CTDE基线，达到或超越全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了有原则且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

*Yixiu Liu,Yang Nan,Weixian Xu,Xiangkun Hu,Lyumanshan Ye,Zhen Qin,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ASI - Arch系统实现AI自主架构创新，突破人类认知限制，发现众多创新架构并建立科学发现的经验缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究受人类认知能力线性限制，存在发展瓶颈，需突破此约束。

Method: 提出ASI - Arch系统，实现从自动化优化到自动化创新的范式转变，可端到端自主开展架构发现科研。

Result: ASI - Arch进行1773次自主实验，发现106个创新的线性注意力架构，其架构超越人类设计基线。

Conclusion: 建立科学发现的经验缩放定律，为自加速AI系统提供蓝图。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出用于医疗的Agentic AI框架，自动化临床数据管道，减少专家干预，实现AI临床应用的可扩展、低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗中构建和部署机器学习解决方案因工作流碎片化、模型兼容性和数据隐私约束而昂贵且劳动密集。

Method: 引入模块化、任务特定的代理系统，处理结构化和非结构化数据，实现自动特征选择、模型选择和预处理推荐。

Result: 在公开数据集上评估，展示了各代理在不同数据上的处理流程，最终生成可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该框架减少了ML生命周期中高摩擦阶段对专家干预的需求，为临床环境中AI的实施提供了可扩展、经济高效的途径。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

*Sedigh Khademi,Christopher Palmer,Muhammad Javed,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila,Jim Black*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文结合自然语言处理技术和主动学习，利用急诊分诊笔记开发分类器，以加强疫苗安全监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验安全数据收集窗口有限且疫苗广泛接种，需要疫苗上市后监测系统。

Method: 结合主动学习、数据增强及评估技术，利用自然语言处理和主动学习开发分类器。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论，但表明该方法可用于加强疫苗安全监测。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究均值聚合图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，对比不同设置下与其他聚合函数GNNs及逻辑的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究均值作为聚合函数的图神经网络的表达能力。

Method: 分别在非均匀和均匀设置下，将均值GNNs的表达能力与不同逻辑及其他聚合函数的GNNs进行对比分析。

Result: 非均匀设置下，均值GNNs与比率模态逻辑表达能力相同，高于最大聚合GNNs，低于求和聚合GNNs；均匀设置下，满足特定假设时相对MSO的表达能力是无交替模态逻辑，比求和及最大聚合GNNs弱，去掉假设表达能力增强。

Conclusion: 均值GNNs在不同设置和假设下有不同的表达能力，且与其他聚合函数的GNNs有表达能力的强弱关系。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出认知归因框架解耦大语言模型知识和推理贡献，在多模型和数据集验证，有系列发现并提供新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理时结合知识和推理，区分二者对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 受双系统认知理论启发，将大语言模型认知分解为知识检索和推理调整两阶段，通过快思和慢思两种认知模式生成答案并分析性能。

Result: 推理调整有领域特异性；参数扩展提升知识和推理，知识提升更明显，使推理更审慎且更智能；知识主要在低层，推理在高层。

Conclusion: 框架有助于从解耦角度理解大语言模型，为相关研究提供新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 Answer Set Programming 中不同于稳定模型、不遵循模型最小性原则的析取语义。

Method: 对比四种不同的析取语义，证明其中三种方法的等价性。

Result: 三种方法（Forks、Justified Models 和 DI 语义的合理松弛）等价，构成一种通用方法；该共同语义是程序稳定模型的超集，且强于 Strongly Supported Models。

Conclusion: 在 Answer Set Programming 中找到了三种等价的非最小析取语义，且它们在语义强度上有差异。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Result: 未提及明确结果，对超1500份2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛学生真题进行评估。

Conclusion: 未提及明确结论。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型推理基准多强调事实准确性或逐步逻辑，而金融领域专业人员需要在不确定下做最优决策和创造可行未来，需评估大语言模型在金融任务中的发散和收敛思维。

Method: 引入ConDiFi基准，包含607个宏观金融发散推理提示和990个多跳对抗性选择题用于收敛推理，用其评估14个领先模型。

Result: 评估发现模型间有显著差异，GPT - 4o在新颖性和可行性方面表现不佳，DeepSeek - R1和Cohere Command R+等模型在生成适合投资决策的可行见解方面排名靠前。

Conclusion: ConDiFi为金融领域安全和战略部署大语言模型的推理能力评估提供新视角。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级IB正则化方法能有效提升大语言模型推理性能，且可无缝集成到现有基于强化学习的微调框架中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的呼叫路由，以最小化客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Method: 比较基于模型的价值迭代（VI）和无模型的近端策略优化（PPO）两种方法，将问题构建为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），使用模拟模型评估策略。

Result: 经过1000次测试，PPO始终获得最高奖励，同时客户等待时间和员工闲置时间最低，但训练时间更长。

Conclusion: 在呼叫中心呼叫路由优化中，PPO方法虽然训练时间长，但效果优于其他方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确提及结论。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Contemporary database systems, while effective, suffer severe issues related
to complexity and usability, especially among individuals who lack technical
expertise but are unfamiliar with query languages like Structured Query
Language (SQL). This paper presents a new database system supported by
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of
data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and
automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like
yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and
application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to
strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is
purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current
database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills,
manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI
database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its
schema models and execution formats.

Motivation: 解决Bittensor的Subnet 9中每个矿工需本地存储完整模型以及“赢家通吃”奖励机制导致模型囤积的问题。

Method: 提出IOTA架构，包括数据和管道并行的SWARM架构、粒度连续激励、激活压缩、Butterfly All - Reduce和CLASP公平归因方案。

Result: 实现模型大小随参与者数量扩展、按贡献分配奖励、减少激活通信带宽、提供线性可扩展性和冗余性、检测利用行为等。

Conclusion: IOTA架构能解决原有问题，使原本孤立的竞争者成为合作单元，可任意扩展并公平奖励贡献者。

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文提出PolyServe调度策略，解决大语言模型应用多SLO请求调度难题，实现高SLO达成率和高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将工作负载简单分为LS和BE，忽略了LS类内差异，导致用户体验不佳和调度机会减少，高效服务多SLO请求面临挑战。

Method: PolyServe先按每令牌延迟要求对请求分组，将每组调度到部分服务器；将请求路由到高负载但仍能满足SLO的服务器；允许宽松SLO请求在自身服务器饱和时共享严格SLO实例；利用分析数据指导调度决策，通过请求等待时间感知调度、动态分块和连续分块预填充预测管理尾延迟。

Result: PolyServe较现有策略实现1.23倍的有效吞吐量提升，达到最优有效吞吐量的92.5%。

Conclusion: PolyServe能在保持高SLO达成率的同时最大化吞吐量，有效解决多SLO请求调度问题。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Motivation: 评估不同软件QUBO求解器在不同规模和收敛阈值下的性能，了解各求解器在解质量、可扩展性和运行效率方面的表现。

Method: 在1000x1000到45000x45000的随机生成QUBO矩阵上，使用六种从10^-1到10^-6的收敛阈值，对Neal、PyTorch(CPU)、PyTorch(GPU)、JAX和SciPy这五种求解器进行基准测试，从解质量（能量）和计算时间两方面评估性能。

Result: Neal解质量最好，但受内存限制；PyTorch可扩展性好，运行时间短，能处理大规模问题；JAX解质量稍逊，处理规模受限；SciPy处理规模小，解质量差且计算时间长。

Conclusion: 在有计算资源的情况下，PyTorch是大规模QUBO问题最平衡的选择，不同求解器在解质量、可扩展性和运行效率间存在权衡。

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural

traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

Method: 引入FIFO、LRU和基于优先级的缓存策略，选择性转发重要更新。

Result: 在CIFAR - 10和医疗数据集实验中，减少了通信，精度损失极小。

Conclusion: 智能缓存提高了可扩展性和内存效率，支持边缘物联网网络中可靠的联邦学习，适用于智能城市、医疗等对延迟敏感的应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.

Result: 通过对七个最先进的大语言模型进行评估，揭示了任务难度差异、对训练曝光较少平台泛化能力差以及有针对性的提示策略的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench可有效评估大语言模型生成深度学习内核，代码开源。

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzzll123/MultiKernelBench.

Abstract: What if you could piece together your own custom biometrics and AI analysis
system, a bit like LEGO blocks? We aim to bring that technology to field
operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system
that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP
(Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular
edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in
specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object
tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based
accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating
system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically
secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design,
including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK
operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic
capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments
demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute
accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of
the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field
biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future
improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

Motivation: 大规模AI模型增长使单数据中心算力和电力不足，分布式训练有通信开销，且现有方法忽略站点间电力异质性，需解决在电力受限、地理分布式环境中训练大模型的问题。

Method: 引入PowerTrip系统，运行时基于电力成本启发式动态选择站点，采用动态贪心方法，用训练效率边际增益优化站点数量。

Result: 使用谷歌真实电力轨迹建模评估，PowerTrip可比现有基线策略减少达50%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PowerTrip系统能有效解决电力受限、地理分布式环境下大模型训练的电力通信权衡问题，提升训练效率。

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云平台共置微服务虽提升资源利用率，但引入资源竞争和干扰，需设计干扰感知策略以提升资源利用率和减轻干扰，且面临不可靠指标、应用多样性和节点异构性等挑战。

Method: 分析阿里巴巴大规模共置微服务集群特点，采用CPI作为干扰度量指标并通过多维指标实现准确预测，设计C - Koordinator平台并融入共置和干扰缓解策略。

Result: 干扰预测模型准确率超90.3%，能精确预测和快速缓解干扰，在不同系统负载下应用延迟在各百分位响应时间（P50、P90、P99）降低16.7% - 36.1%。

Conclusion: 该系统能在共置环境中保持应用性能平稳。

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

Conclusion: CoCoServe能实现更具成本效益的LLM部署。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing numerous industries, but
their substantial computational demands create challenges for efficient
deployment, particularly in cloud environments. Traditional approaches to
inference serving often struggle with resource inefficiencies, leading to high
operational costs, latency issues, and limited scalability. This article
explores how Cloud Native technologies, such as containerization,
microservices, and dynamic scheduling, can fundamentally improve LLM inference
serving. By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native
system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and
enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations
using Kubernetes-based autoscaling, we show that Cloud Native architectures can
dynamically adapt to workload fluctuations, mitigating performance bottlenecks
while optimizing LLM inference serving performance. This discussion provides a
broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of
scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers,
practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial
intelligence.

Method: 提出FCPO，结合CRL与FRL，动态调整推理批量大小、输入分辨率和多线程，通过特定聚合方案和经验缓冲区结合二者

Result: 在真实EVA测试平台实验显示，有效吞吐量提升超5倍，延迟降低60%，收敛速度加快20%，内存消耗最多降低至十分之一

Conclusion: FCPO相比基于SOTA RL的方法有显著性能提升，能有效解决EVA实时推理服务系统问题

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional
engines'scalability limits, spurring Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

Result: 三个问题都存在关于polylog(k/σ)的竞争算法，同时给出了竞争比的下界，与上界在对数多项式的指数上匹配。

Conclusion: 在平滑分析下，三个问题的竞争比表现优于完全对抗场景。

Abstract: We study three classical online problems -- $k$-server, $k$-taxi, and chasing
size $k$ sets -- through a lens of smoothed analysis. Our setting allows
request locations to be adversarial up to small perturbations, interpolating
between worst-case and average-case models. Specifically, we show that if the
metric space is contained in a ball in any normed space and requests are drawn
from distributions whose density functions are upper bounded by $1/\sigma$
times the uniform density over the ball, then all three problems admit
polylog$(k/\sigma)$-competitive algorithms. Our approach is simple: it reduces
smoothed instances to fully adversarial instances on finite metrics and
leverages existing algorithms in a black-box manner. We also provide a lower
bound showing that no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio
sub-polylogarithmic in $k/\sigma$, matching our upper bounds up to the exponent
of the polylogarithm. In contrast, the best known competitive ratios for these
problems in the fully adversarial setting are $2k-1$, $\infty$ and
$\Theta(k^2)$, respectively.

Conclusion: 研究结果缩小了半流式模型下近似单源最短路径遍历复杂度的差距，从多项式对数级与ω(1)的差距缩小到二次方差距。

Abstract: In the semi-streaming model, an algorithm must process any $n$-vertex graph
by making one or few passes over a stream of its edges, use $O(n \cdot
\text{polylog }n)$ words of space, and at the end of the last pass, output a
solution to the problem at hand. Approximating (single-source) shortest paths
on undirected graphs is a longstanding open question in this model. In this
work, we make progress on this question from both upper and lower bound fronts:
  We present a simple randomized algorithm that for any $\epsilon > 0$, with
high probability computes $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from a
given source vertex in \[
  O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot n \log^3 n \right)~\text{space} \quad
\text{and} \quad O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot \left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log
n} \right) ^2\right) ~\text{passes}.
  \] The algorithm can also be derandomized and made to work on dynamic streams
at a cost of some extra $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$ factors only in the
space. Previously, the best known algorithms for this problem required
$1/\epsilon \cdot \log^{c}(n)$ passes, for an unspecified large constant $c$.
  We prove that any semi-streaming algorithm that with large constant
probability outputs any constant approximation to shortest paths from a given
source vertex (even to a single fixed target vertex and only the distance, not
necessarily the path) requires \[ \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)
~\text{passes}. \] We emphasize that our lower bound holds for any
constant-factor approximation of shortest paths. Previously, only constant-pass
lower bounds were known and only for small approximation ratios below two.
  Our results collectively reduce the gap in the pass complexity of
approximating single-source shortest paths in the semi-streaming model from
$\text{polylog } n$ vs $\omega(1)$ to only a quadratic gap.

Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong

Abstract: We show that the max entropy algorithm is a randomized 1.49776 approximation
for half-integral TSP, improving upon the previous known bound of 1.49993 from
Karlin et al. This also improves upon the best-known approximation for
half-integral TSP due to Gupta et al. Our improvement results from using the
dual, instead of the primal, to analyze the expected cost of the matching. We
believe this method of analysis could lead to a simpler proof that max entropy
is a better-than-3/2 approximation in the general case.
  We also give a 1.4671 approximation for half integral LP solutions with no
proper minimum cuts and an even number of vertices, improving upon the bound of
Haddadan and Newman of 1.476. We then extend the analysis to the case when
there are an odd number of vertices $n$ at the cost of an additional $O(1/n)$
factor.

Motivation: 将持久完美系统发育问题转化为二分图识别问题后，直接解决此类图的识别问题。

Method: 提出仅依赖图属性的多项式时间算法，用于判定最大图（无字符物种集包含于其他字符物种集）中持久完美系统发育的存在性。

Result: 得到了判定最大图中持久完美系统发育存在性的多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 该算法缩小了完美系统发育线性时间简单算法和k>1时Dollo - k系统发育NP难结果之间的差距。

Abstract: The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo-1, has been introduced
as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary
characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. The problem of
deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the
one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and
characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of
recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding
Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character's
species set is contained within another character's species set. Our solution,
that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time
simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the
Dollo-$k$ phylogeny with $k>1$.

### [44] [$k$-Approval Veto: A Spectrum of Voting Rules Balancing Metric Distortion and Minority Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17981)
*Fatih Erdem Kizilkaya,David Kempe*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文探讨单胜者排序选举中多数原则与少数原则的权衡，分析k - Approval Veto投票规则，展示其在少数群体保护和社会福利间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在单胜者排序选举中，平衡民主系统中多数原则（最大化社会福利）和少数原则（保护少数群体）这两个相互竞争的目标。

Method: 用度量失真框架衡量社会福利，引入ℓ - 相互少数标准衡量少数群体保护，分析k - Approval Veto投票规则。

Result: k - Approval Veto投票规则的少数群体保护至少为k，但会降低社会福利。功利目标下，度量失真随k线性增加；α - 百分位目标下，α ≥ k/(k + 1)时度量失真为最优值5，α < k/(k + 1)时无界；平等目标下，度量失真对所有k值均为最优值3。

Conclusion: k - Approval Veto投票规则能提供不同程度的少数群体保护，但会牺牲一定的社会福利，可根据需求选择合适的k值以平衡两个原则。

Abstract: In the context of single-winner ranked-choice elections between $m$
candidates, we explore the tradeoff between two competing goals in every
democratic system: the majority principle (maximizing the social welfare) and
the minority principle (safeguarding minority groups from overly bad
outcomes).To measure the social welfare, we use the well-established framework
of metric distortion subject to various objectives: utilitarian (i.e., total
cost), $\alpha$-percentile (e.g., median cost for $\alpha = 1/2$), and
egalitarian (i.e., max cost). To measure the protection of minorities, we
introduce the $\ell$-mutual minority criterion, which requires that if a
sufficiently large (parametrized by $\ell$) coalition $T$ of voters ranks all
candidates in $S$ lower than all other candidates, then none of the candidates
in $S$ should win. The highest $\ell$ for which the criterion is satisfied
provides a well-defined measure of mutual minority protection (ranging from 1
to $m$).
  Our main contribution is the analysis of a recently proposed class of voting
rules called $k$-Approval Veto, offering a comprehensive range of trade-offs
between the two principles. This class spans between Plurality Veto (for $k=1$)
- a simple voting rule achieving optimal metric distortion - and Vote By Veto
(for $k=m$) which picks a candidate from the proportional veto core. We show
that $k$-Approval Veto has minority protection at least $k$, and thus, it
accommodates any desired level of minority protection. However, this comes at
the price of lower social welfare. For the utilitarian objective, the metric
distortion increases linearly in $k$. For the $\alpha$-percentile objective,
the metric distortion is the optimal value of 5 for $\alpha \ge k/(k+1)$ and
unbounded for $\alpha < k/(k+1)$. For the egalitarian objective, the metric
distortion is the optimal value of 3 for all values of $k$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带加性个性化双值效用下不可分物品公平分配中帕累托最优分配的判定及EFX分配的存在性与计算问题。

Method: 对帕累托最优分配进行刻画，分析不同情况下判定问题复杂度，设计算法证明EFX分配可多项式时间计算。

Result: 整数价值比时，可多项式时间判定给定分配是否帕累托最优；一般情况判定问题是coNP完全；EFX分配总是存在且可多项式时间计算。

Conclusion: 补充了现有双值和三值效用下的相关结果，扩展了双值效用下EFX分配的结论，提出EFX和帕累托最优分配是否存在及可多项式计算的开放性问题。

Abstract: We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$
agents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent
$i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i > b_i > 0$ to each good, indicating
that agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For
convenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.
  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our
characterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given
allocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the
general case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision
problem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this
decision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's
value for each good belongs to $\{a,b,c\}$ for some prescribed $a>b>c\geq0$),
and this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in
our model is the same for each agent).
  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in
polynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which
extends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem
of whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be
computed in polynomial time).

TL;DR: 提出VERIRAG框架解决RAG系统无法评估证据科学质量问题，在四个数据集上表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在临床决策支持中无法评估所检索证据的科学质量。

Method: 引入VERIRAG框架，包括11点检查表Veritable、定量聚合器HV Score和动态接受阈值。

Result: 在四个数据集上，VERIRAG方法始终优于所有基线，F1分数在0.53到0.65之间，比次优方法提高10到14分。

Conclusion: VERIRAG框架有效解决了RAG系统评估证据质量的问题，且将发布可复现结果的所有材料。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

Conclusion: 提出的预测器对预测系统故障有一定效果，但在预测目录故障时性能有待提升。

Abstract: In a Conversational Image Recommendation task, users can provide natural
language feedback on a recommended image item, which leads to an improved
recommendation in the next turn. While typical instantiations of this task
assume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might
often not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item
catalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user
frustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased
number of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task
of Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query
Performance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a
search engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational
performance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic
information contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.
Specifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed
representation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the
classification labels to predict the evaluation turn. Our evaluation scenario
addressed two recommendation scenarios, by differentiating between system
failure, where the system is unable to find the target, and catalogue failure,
where the target does not exist in the item catalogue. In our experiments using
the Shoes and FashionIQ Dresses datasets, we measure the accuracy of predictors
for both system and catalogue failures. Our results demonstrate the promise of
our proposed predictors for predicting system failures (existing evaluation
scenario), while we detect a considerable decrease in predictive performance in
the case of catalogue failure prediction (when inducing a missing item
scenario) compared to system failures.

Motivation: 现有用户模拟器在离线设置下评估系统时存在局限，如仅关注单一目标物品且模拟用户有无限耐心。

Method: 提出Fashion - AlterEval数据集，添加新注释；提出两种新的元用户模拟器，利用收集的判断信息。

Result: 模拟器利用替代项知识对现有对话推荐系统模型评估有显著影响，单一目标评估低估了模型有效性，考虑替代项系统能更快满足用户。

Conclusion: 考虑替代项能改善对话推荐系统的评估和性能。

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

<details>

Motivation: 推荐系统依赖高敏感用户-物品交互数据训练模型，但现实中隐私保护不足，且无方法让用户知晓哪些交互更敏感，因此需量化训练数据隐私风险。

Method: 提出基于成员推理攻击（MIA）的隐私评分方法RecPS，在交互和用户层面衡量隐私风险，其交互级评分定义源于差分隐私，关键组件是交互级MIA方法RecLiRA。

Result: 在知名基准数据集和推荐系统模型上进行大量实验，展示了RecPS评分在风险评估和推荐系统模型遗忘方面的独特特征和优势。

Conclusion: RecPS方法有助于实现隐私感知的推荐系统模型开发和部署。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web
applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on
highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques
are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model
development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled
access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to
share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the
user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,
quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to
enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a
membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to
measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS
interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential
privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical
component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality
membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known
benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits
of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RsLiRA-4BD3/readme.md.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的文本嵌入器可有效解决现有先例检索方法面临的挑战，是更好的先例检索方案。

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Abstract: Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering
more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning,
assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts,
these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper
investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite
skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and
without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark
dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their
expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we
evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4,
Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference
latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick,
Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with
expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without
supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable
prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning,
intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.

Abstract: The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in
training recommender systems remain critical challenges, hindering their
practical deployment in real-world scenarios. In the multimodal recommendation
(MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and
exacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal
recommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent
challenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec,
revealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during
model optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose
FastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys
graph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in
training. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase
significantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating
the modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training
phase. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently
demonstrating the performance superiority of FastMMRec over competitive
baselines while achieving efficiency and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前向量数据库服务提供商多使用专有黑盒模型，用户查询时暴露原始文本会导致敏感信息泄漏。

Method: 引入STEER框架，利用不同嵌入模型语义空间的对齐关系推导查询文本的近似嵌入向量，在原向量数据库中用近似嵌入向量检索，无需修改服务器端。

Result: 理论和实验分析表明，STEER能有效保护查询文本隐私并维持检索精度，Recall@100下降小于5%，在数百万条目文本语料中搜索时，Recall@20比当前基线高20%。

Conclusion: STEER能有效保护隐私，防止嵌入反转攻击，且有较好的检索性能。

Abstract: Vector Database (VDB) can efficiently index and search high-dimensional
vector embeddings from unstructured data, crucially enabling fast semantic
similarity search essential for modern AI applications like generative AI and
recommendation systems. Since current VDB service providers predominantly use
proprietary black-box models, users are forced to expose raw query text to them
via API in exchange for the vector retrieval services. Consequently, if query
text involves confidential records from finance or healthcare domains, this
mechanism inevitably leads to critical leakage of user's sensitive information.
To address this issue, we introduce STEER (\textbf{S}ecure \textbf{T}ransformed
\textbf{E}mbedding v\textbf{E}ctor\textbf{ R}etrieval), a private vector
retrieval framework that leverages the alignment relationship between the
semantic spaces of different embedding models to derive approximate embeddings
for the query text. STEER performs the retrieval using the approximate
embeddings within the original VDB and requires no modifications to the server
side. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that STEER
effectively safeguards query text privacy while maintaining the retrieval
accuracy. Even though approximate embeddings are approximations of the
embeddings from proprietary models, they still prevent the providers from
recovering the query text through Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs). Extensive
experimental results show that Recall@100 of STEER can basically achieve a
decrease of less than 5\%. Furthermore, even when searching within a text
corpus of millions of entries, STEER achieves a Recall@20 accuracy 20\% higher
than current baselines.

Motivation: EHR检索存在语义差距问题，现有通用和生物医学领域模型因医疗知识不足或训练语料不匹配而效果不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段训练管道，第一阶段进行医学实体提取和知识注入，第二阶段用大语言模型生成多样训练数据，训练两个不同参数的DR.EHR变体。

Conclusion: 该工作显著推进了EHR检索，为临床应用提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential

high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

TL;DR: 为解决边缘设备低比特量化模型训练问题，提出QuaRC框架，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需低比特量化模型高效部署，但传统QAT计算成本高，现有方法在小数据集上无法消除量化误差。

Method: 提出QuaRC框架，包括用相对熵分数选核心集，训练阶段采用级联层校正策略。

Result: 在ImageNet - 1K数据集上，用1%数据子集将ResNet - 18量化到2比特时，Top - 1准确率比现有技术提升5.72%。

Conclusion: 提出的QuaRC框架有效。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 所设计的模型在语义通信的数据重建方面表现良好，具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的黑盒性质使其可解释性面临挑战，现有方法难以捕捉网络中节点间复杂交互模式。

Method: 提出GraphEXT框架，将图节点划分为联盟，把原图分解为独立子图，引入图结构作为外部性并结合外部性下的Shapley值，通过节点在联盟间转换时对GNN预测的边际贡献量化节点重要性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验显示，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构上的保真度优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphEXT能显著增强GNN模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Conclusion: 调整特征网络自相似程度可增强深度神经网络的分类性能。

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Conclusion: 所提出的强化学习自适应优化算法在气动外形优化降维中有应用价值，可加速全局优化并辅助结果解释。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Conclusion: 动态早停方法及其基于置信度的改进能有效减少大语言模型调用次数，在降低计算成本和保证准确性间取得平衡。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Conclusion: CICME方法有效，能从多领域异构数据中可靠推断因果机制。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCAI有效，能在多元时间序列分析中进行准确预测和异常检测，且有理论基础和低部署开销。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Method: 提出 LLM 增强时空扩散模型 LSDM，结合扩散模型生成能力、变压器自适应学习能力，利用 LLM 捕获多模态环境信息。

Result: 在真实数据集评估中，LSDM 在流量使用预测中表现出色，有良好泛化和适应性；加入上下文信息后，决定系数性能提升至少 2.83%；相比 CSDI 等模型，均方根误差至少降低 8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM 模型在服务级移动流量预测上有优秀表现，具备推广价值，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Conclusion: WGAN框架提升降水降尺度感知真实度，为评估和质控降水数据集提供新视角

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Motivation: 解决生成分子设计中理想属性分子稀缺的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出分子任务算术，在多样且丰富的负样本上训练模型学习‘属性方向’，朝相反属性方向生成正分子。

Result: 在20个零样本设计实验中，比用正分子训练的模型生成更多样且成功的设计；在双目标和少样本设计任务中能增加设计多样性并保持理想属性。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术简单、数据高效、性能好，有潜力成为从头分子设计的实际转移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Result: MFNO能任意精度近似相关方程解和变换，有强分辨率泛化性，性能可比或优于基线模型，样本路径生成速度更快。

Conclusion: MFNO是学习随机系统动力学的有效方法，在处理非周期输入和性能上有优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共 - 私有数据结合的差分隐私机器学习算法，在数据源同分布时已知结合无互补价值，需研究分布偏移时情况。

Method: 将已知的公共 - 私有学习下界扩展到两个数据源有显著分布偏移的场景。

Result: 小偏移时，公私数据其一需足够丰富来估计私有参数；大偏移时，公共数据无益处。

Conclusion: 在分布偏移场景下，不同偏移程度对公共和私有数据在参数估计中的作用不同。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Result: 无明确提及具体研究结果。

Conclusion: 探讨了 FL 在云机器人操作中的机遇和挑战，为后续研究提供方向。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于生成具有所需特性的新超材料，数据和代码开放以支持后续研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Conclusion: SETOL理论有效，能用于解释神经网络性能和评估层质量。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest混合红队方法，对具有文化多样性的、人类编写的对抗性提示种子进行引导扩展。

Result: 扩展后的提示保留了人类提示的特征和攻击模式，攻击成功率分别为0.31（NudeNet）、0.36（SD NSFW）、0.12（Q16），数据集多样性显著提高，有535个独特地理位置，香农熵为7.48。

Conclusion: 证明了人机协作在利用人类创造力和机器计算能力，实现全面、可扩展的红队测试以持续评估文本到图像模型安全性方面的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Motivation: 现有城市人口流动预测方法存在传统模型依赖静态空间假设、深度学习模型跨城市泛化难、大语言模型计算成本高且无法捕捉空间结构等问题，且很多方法牺牲分辨率，限制了城市级分析的实用性。

Method: 引入UrbanPulse框架，将每个兴趣点作为单个节点，结合时间图卷积编码器和基于Transformer的解码器，采用三阶段迁移学习策略（大规模城市图预训练、冷启动适应、强化学习微调）。

Result: 在加州三个大都市区超1.03亿条清理后的GPS记录上评估，UrbanPulse实现了最先进的准确性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过高效迁移学习，UrbanPulse朝着在不同城市实际部署高分辨率、人工智能驱动的城市预测迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Motivation: 现有研究在帖子质量评估中存在未利用多模态线索、融合引入噪声、缺乏复杂语义关系捕捉能力等局限。

Method: 提出MFTRR框架，将帖子质量评估重构为排序任务，包含局部 - 全局语义关联推理模块和多级证据关系推理模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，显著优于现有基线方法，在艺术历史数据集上NDCG@3较最佳单模态方法提升达9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR框架在帖子质量评估任务中有效且性能出色。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Motivation: 识别表格数据集数据偏移因素有挑战，隐私规则限制数据访问且复杂过程噪音阻碍分析。

Method: 提出SIFOTL方法，提取隐私合规数据统计信息，用双XGBoost模型结合大语言模型分离干预信号和噪音，通过帕累托加权决策树合并输出识别偏移段。

Result: 在MEPS面板数据集和18个EHR数据集上，SIFOTL的F1分数显著高于BigQuery贡献分析和统计测试等基线方法。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供可解释、注重隐私的工作流程，对观测噪音具有经验上的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Conclusion: 通过让模型“遗忘”数据，有望提升数据驱动交通状态估计和预测的可信度和可靠性。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

Conclusion: C - AAE为医疗保健中基于传感器的连续活动识别提供了平衡隐私和实用性的实用途径。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出Squeeze10 - LLM框架将16位大语言模型权重压缩10倍，在子2位仅权重量化上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署因参数多、计算成本高而具挑战性，超低比特量化极端压缩会致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出Squeeze10 - LLM，采用分阶段混合精度训练后量化框架，引入PBAR和FIAS。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2实验中，六零样本分类任务平均准确率从43%提升到56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10 - LLM在子2位仅权重量化上性能出色，优于现有PTQ方法。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督视为概率分布，通过仿射组合构建软标签，进行理论分析和泛化误差分析。

Result: 发现额外监督关键是未分配硬标签类别的分布信息，额外监督和混合系数互补优化软标签，理论表征其对误差界影响。

Conclusion: 基于理论设计额外监督，即使简单使用也能提高分类准确率。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Motivation: 解决O - RAN架构中多个MVNO竞争PRB，需满足概率延迟上限约束并最小化PRB使用的问题。

Method: 先基于大数定律推导奖励函数并进行实际修改，提出PDA - DRL方法；引入奖励式个性化方法处理多MVNO模型权重共享。

Result: PDA - DRL比基于平均延迟约束优化的DRL模型使平均延迟降低38%；奖励式个性化方法优于传统聚合方法。

Conclusion: PDA - DRL和奖励式个性化方法在解决O - RAN架构中RAN切片问题上表现优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 所提方法在强化学习对抗攻击方面具有优越性，能有效诱导目标智能体做出次优决策。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Method: 使用模型的前缀置信度选择最有前景的尝试，在五个数学推理数据集上系统评估前缀置信度缩放，还评估了带前缀置信度的测试时间训练。

Result: 仅32个令牌的前缀的前缀置信度缩放比多数投票有更好的准确率 - 计算权衡，且比BoN更不易受长度偏差影响；带前缀置信度的测试时间训练虽优于基础模型，但不如前缀置信度缩放。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数学推理任务中，通过前缀置信度选择尝试可有效提升性能，前缀置信度缩放效果较好。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Conclusion: GraphALP框架能有效解决含噪声标签的类别不平衡图节点分类问题。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect框架有效解决了现有含噪标签学习方法的问题，具有良好的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 通过跨数据集评估（在Argoverse2上训练，在NuScenes上评估）展示了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出方法能使模型更好地泛化到未见场景。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Result: 实验表明该方法有强鲁棒性和高效性，在Louvain和Metis算法下分别平均比基线高2.92%和3.4%。

Conclusion: FedSA - GCL能有效解决现有联邦图学习的挑战，具有良好性能。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Conclusion: 提出的SINDy - LOM方法有效，可应用于复杂工业系统。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation

designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 过去十年电池应用增加，电池健康监测重要，现有模型处理电池健康状态（SoH）估算有问题，提出TIDSIT架构，实验表明其表现优于现有模型且有泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池在相关系统中重要但会随时间退化，准确估算SoH对可靠性和安全性至关重要，现有机器学习模型处理实际数据不规则性存在问题。

Method: 提出Time - Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT)架构，结合连续时间嵌入表示不规则采样数据，利用带时间注意力机制的填充序列处理可变长度输入。

Result: 在NASA电池退化数据集上，TIDSIT显著优于现有模型，预测误差降低超50%，SoH预测误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT架构表现好且具有泛化性，有望用于涉及不规则时间序列数据的健康监测任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: 本文指出当前无模型多智能体强化学习算法成功或因学习简单约定而非有效恢复马尔可夫信号，认为问题源于基准设计，倡导基于新原则构建合作环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当前无模型多智能体强化学习算法成功的原因，以及现有基准环境的合理性。

Method: 通过针对性案例研究，分析算法学习到的策略。

Result: 发现协同适应的智能体可学习到脆弱约定，任务设计改变时模型能学习到基于观察的策略，现代多智能体环境可能未充分测试Dec - POMDP核心假设。

Conclusion: 倡导基于行为基于观察和基于记忆推理其他智能体这两个核心原则构建新的合作环境。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HyperDeepONets虽提高表达能力，但存在高内存和计算成本问题，需改进。

Method: 在物理信息机器学习环境下，引入PI - LoRA - HyperDeepONets，将超网络输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵。

Result: 在常微分方程和偏微分方程实验中，参数最多减少70%，预测准确性和泛化能力优于普通HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI - LoRA - HyperDeepONets能有效降低复杂度，提升性能。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出HYPER方法用于流量预测，在日本87个流域评估，数据丰富和稀缺场景下表现良好，为流量预测提供有效方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多地区缺乏足够河流量观测数据，现有模型在数据稀缺条件下难兼顾准确性、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: 先对43个未校准概念水文模型用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA），再用线性回归训练水库计算（RC）模型校正BMA输出误差，对无测站流域通过关联有测站流域集水区属性推断所需权重。

Result: 数据丰富时，HYPER与LSTM表现相当但计算时间仅5%；数据稀缺时，HYPER性能稳健（KGE 0.55）、不确定性低，LSTM性能显著下降（KGE -0.04）。

Conclusion: 有效大集合与机器学习偏差校正结合时，单个概念水文模型不一定要校准，HYPER为流量预测提供稳健、高效、可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 所提出的修订双模拟度量能有效解决传统双模拟度量存在的问题。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Result: 在Cornell、Texas和Wisconsin等基准数据集实验中，GLANCE表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: GLANCE轻量、可适配，能为异质图场景提供稳健且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Result: 在MNIST上实验表明，少量类结构足以启动有用的合成训练管道。

Conclusion: C2G - KD框架在数据无知识蒸馏方面有效，少量类结构可发挥作用。

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Conclusion: FMB定律为跨学科理解、比较和设计学习算法提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Result: GPTQ误差传播步骤有直观几何解释，在无裁剪条件下继承Babai算法的误差上界。

Conclusion: 研究为GPTQ奠定理论基础，为十亿参数模型未来量化算法设计引入格算法的研究成果。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI

classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test

Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the

Method: 对比NMC与传统存储程序架构在时间、空间和能量缩放方面的特性。

Conclusion: NMC适用于可扩展和稀疏算法，与为密集数值应用优化的传统多核系统适用算法不同。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

TL;DR: 提出将定点乘法器分解为子组件以提高功率效率的方法，在特定输入下可显著降低开关活动，且有进一步优化空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大化定点乘法器功率效率。

Method: 将乘法器分解为编码器和乘法器模块，分别合成和优化，利用符号幅度编码的功率效率。

Result: 在特定输入下，4位乘法器设计开关活动最多降低12.9%，放宽条件可降低33%，还能通过开关活动驱动的设计空间探索进一步提高5 - 10%功率效率。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著节省功率，可应用于生产系统，且有优化潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出统一的动力学系统方法处理回声状态网络（ESNs），证明相关性质、拓展普遍性、量化计算资源、建立吸引子和推导边界，得出设计规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs 虽有高效处理时间流的优势，但稳定性、记忆和表达能力等基本问题在各学科中分散，需要统一处理。

Method: 结合泛函分析、随机吸引子理论和神经科学发现，采用证明定理、量化计算资源等方法。

Result: 证明回声状态属性和全局 Lipschitz 动力学产生衰落记忆属性，拓展 ESNs 普遍性到随机输入，量化计算资源，建立吸引子和推导边界。

Conclusion: 分析得出基于数学和神经科学的具体设计规则，解释了中小规模 ESNs 常能媲美全训练循环网络的原因。

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出AI辅助软件工程的实用过程模型和二维决策框架，为AI工具在软件工程中的有效使用提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究软件工程师在日常任务中如何与AI工具互动，特别是如何处理AI生成的输出。

Method: 基于土耳其和阿塞拜疆三个行业的从业者报告和直接观察。

Result: 提出实用过程模型和二维决策框架，展示工程师在人工监督下使用AI的方式。

Conclusion: 这些模型为软件工程中更审慎有效地使用AI工具提供结构化、轻量级指导，有助于关于人机协作的讨论。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 解决科学报告缺乏标准化和透明度、清单未被严格遵循以及同行评审难以发现缺失项的问题。

Method: 对11种自动化工具在9种严谨性标准上进行广泛比较。

Result: 部分标准下有明显优势工具，部分情况组合工具表现超单一工具，还确定了工具开发者应聚焦的关键领域。

Conclusion: 为严谨性和透明度检测工具的利益相关者提供了见解和建议。

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data
for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.

Conclusion: 可揭示GenAI在使用模式、开发者关注点和整合实践方面与其他方法的差异。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

TL;DR: 研究计算教育者在软件工程和计算课程中采用项目式学习（PjBL）的影响因素，发现采用受多种挑战影响，需系统支持结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PjBL虽有诸多益处，但教师采用情况不一致，研究其面临的障碍及促进成功采用的策略和资源。

Method: 采用混合方法，对80名计算教师进行在线调查，包括封闭式问题和开放式问题，分别用统计方法和主题分析法分析定量和定性数据。

Result: PjBL受广泛重视，但采用常具选择性，受规划管理、项目设计和缺乏机构支持等挑战影响；教师在有同行协作、专业发展和机构激励时更易采用；从研究、行业合作和同行处获取项目是新项目的关键促进因素。

Conclusion: 强调需要系统性支持结构来让教师尝试和推广PjBL实践。

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对开源真实世界CI工作流与最佳实践的契合情况实证理解有限，很多工作流可能过于复杂。

Method: 使用Java、Python和C++仓库的大量GHA工作流数据集，分析工作流复杂性、结构模式、合规性和不同编程语言的CI管道设计差异。

Result: 未提及具体结果，预期揭示遵循最佳实践的领域和需要改进的方面。

Conclusion: 研究结果将对CI服务有启示，表明CI文档需要更清晰的指南和全面的示例。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标识符名称对程序理解很重要，但不佳命名会增加认知负担、阻碍协作，相似名称易致误解，因此研究其相似性。

Method: 开发分类法对不同形式的标识符名称相似性进行分类。

Result: 得到了关于标识符名称相似性在软件项目中出现情况的初步发现。

Conclusion: 初始分类法能为研究者分析评估标识符名称相似性对代码理解、可维护性和开发者协作的影响提供平台，且可进一步完善扩展。

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型系统依赖复杂供应链，现有风险评估多聚焦模型或数据层面，缺乏系统性研究的基准。

Method: 收集3859个真实大语言模型应用，进行相互依赖分析，提取模型微调路径、数据集复用和库依赖；从公共漏洞数据库收集1555个风险相关问题。

Result: 发现大语言模型应用存在深度嵌套依赖，供应链各环节有显著漏洞。

Conclusion: 给出实用建议，指导研究人员和开发者构建更安全、可信的大语言模型系统。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在自然语言驱动的无代码开发中实现功能添加任务的能力。

Method: 引入NoCode - bench基准测试，包含634个任务和11.4万代码更改，部分由人工验证。

Result: 最佳大语言模型任务成功率仅15.79%，在跨文件编辑、代码库理解和工具调用方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型还未准备好用于完全自然语言驱动的无代码开发，NoCode - bench为该领域未来发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成模糊驱动技术未遵循库使用约定，且无条件执行驱动浪费资源、覆盖率低、产生误报。

Method: 提出Scheduzz技术，利用LLM理解库合理用法并提取API组合约束，实现双调度框架优化资源利用。

Result: 在33个真实库中评估，相比基线方法显著减少计算开销，在部分库上表现优于UTopia，覆盖率高于CKGFuzzer、Promptfuzz和OSS - Fuzz，发现33个未知漏洞，3个获CVE编号。

Conclusion: Scheduzz技术能有效解决现有库模糊测试技术的问题，减少开销、提高覆盖率并发现未知漏洞。

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,

### [133] [YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316)
*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出修复语言模型生成的错误单元测试的技术YATE，在6个开源项目评估，比纯LLM方法有更好覆盖度和杀 mutant 能力，也优于其他4种LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的单元测试存在语法和语义错误，修复这些错误测试可增加测试价值并作为生成额外测试的种子。

Method: 结合基于规则的静态分析和重新提示来修复部分错误测试，提出YATE技术。

Result: 在6个开源项目评估，YATE比纯LLM方法平均多覆盖32.06%的代码行、多杀21.77%的 mutant；与其他4种LLM方法相比，有更高的行覆盖、分支覆盖和杀 mutant 能力。

Conclusion: YATE能有效修复错误测试，在代码覆盖和杀 mutant 方面表现良好，且成本相当。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

TL;DR: 本文研究通用问题的文件定位，构建数据集并评估，结果表明需通用模型，性能因问题类型和项目而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文件定位研究多聚焦特定类型问题，本文旨在研究所有问题的文件定位。

Method: 提供创建问题文件定位数据集的数据管道，用传统信息检索方法评估，用统计分析研究偏差影响。

Result: 特定于bug的启发式方法在通用问题上表现差；不同问题类型性能有差异；标识符对多数问题类型性能影响小；很多结果依赖项目。

Conclusion: 需要研究通用目的模型，鼓励开发可针对项目特性调整的方法。

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

TL;DR: 提出使用FMI控制和与基于SystemC的虚拟平台交互的新框架，通过案例展示其优势，可实现软件测试和验证，提前完成认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统复杂性增加，需要全面测试和虚拟原型设计，而SystemC缺乏原生FMI支持，限制了其在更广泛协同仿真环境中的集成。

Method: 提出使用FMI控制和与基于SystemC的虚拟平台交互的新框架，并进行案例研究。

Result: 通过案例展示了SystemC仿真中的模拟温度传感器可通过FMI从外部工具获取温度值，未修改的目标软件可在VP上运行并接收真实环境输入数据。

Conclusion: 该方法可实现广泛的软件测试和验证，在物理硬件可用时可提前完成ISO 26262等认证。

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

Motivation: 手动代码审查主观且耗时，现有大语言模型用于代码审查缺乏逻辑推理能力，因此需要改进方法。

Method: 提出将符号推理技术与大语言模型集成的混合方法，使用CodexGlue数据集测试，比较CodeT5、CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT等模型。

Result: 该方法提高了自动化代码审查的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理技术与大语言模型的混合方法可有效用于自动化代码审查。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未探索RAG在开源和闭源代码库间分布偏移问题，为缩小差距，研究其在闭源工业级代码库中的表现。

Method: 对26个开源大语言模型，探索基于标识符和相似性的两种RAG方法，对相似性RAG采用不同检索技术，基于1669个内部仓库进行研究，并开展开发者调查。

Result: 两种RAG方法在闭源仓库均有效，相似性RAG更优；相似性RAG检索技术越先进效果越好；组合词法和语义检索技术效果最佳。

Conclusion: RAG方法在闭源工业级代码库的代码补全中有效，组合检索技术优势互补，且经开发者调查验证其实用性。

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

Result: 识别出数据可用性、算法可扩展性和基础设施限制等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 本文可作为理解FFMs的参考和未来创新的路线图，网站将维护相关资源。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated
sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window
Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a
streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses
these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the
CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide
numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that
demonstrates this capability.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效提升A/B测试的效力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动方法在信号分析中有应用价值，可用于多种类型的信号处理。

Abstract: Many signals evolve in time as a stochastic process, randomly switching
between states over discretely sampled time points. Here we make an explicit
link between the underlying stochastic process of a signal that can take on a
bounded continuum of values and a random walk process on a graphon. Graphons
are infinite-dimensional objects that represent the limit of convergent
sequences of graphs whose size tends to infinity. We introduce transfer
operators, such as the Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators, associated with
random walk processes on graphons and then illustrate how these operators can
be estimated from signal data and how their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can
be used for detecting clusters, thereby extending conventional spectral
clustering methods from graphs to graphons. Furthermore, we show that it is
also possible to reconstruct transition probability densities and, if the
random walk process is reversible, the graphon itself using only the signal.
The resulting data-driven methods are applied to a variety of synthetic and
real-world signals, including daily average temperatures and stock index
values.

Result: 在九个基准测试中评估，两种配置下DriftMoE与现有自适应集成方法相比取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: DriftMoE为概念漂移适应提供了一种有原则且高效的方法。

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available
in our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguel-ceadar/drift-moe.

Conclusion: 该方法能可靠完成噪声幅度估计和距离校正任务，提高后续基于距离计算的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Result: 能量信息使假定的点源更暗；对最佳拟合背景模型，过剩与暗物质预测的泊松发射基本一致；若过剩由点源引起，预测银河系中心有大量点源。

Conclusion: GCE可能本质上是弥散的，或者由极大量点源组成。

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Conclusion: 新的潜在子图标准及检查算法为含潜在变量的线性结构方程模型中因果效应的识别提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We develop a criterion to certify whether causal effects are identifiable in
linear structural equation models with latent variables. Linear structural
equation models correspond to directed graphs whose nodes represent the random
variables of interest and whose edges are weighted with linear coefficients
that correspond to direct causal effects. In contrast to previous
identification methods, we do not restrict ourselves to settings where the
latent variables constitute independent latent factors (i.e., to source nodes
in the graphical representation of the model). Our novel latent-subgraph
criterion is a purely graphical condition that is sufficient for
identifiability of causal effects by rational formulas in the covariance
matrix. To check the latent-subgraph criterion, we provide a sound and complete
algorithm that operates by solving an integer linear program. While it targets
effects involving observed variables, our new criterion is also useful for
identifying effects between latent variables, as it allows one to transform the
given model into a simpler measurement model for which other existing tools
become applicable.

Abstract: As one of the major challenges for the conservative smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) method, the zero-order consistency issue, although thought
to be mitigated by the particle regularization scheme, such as the transport
velocity formulation, significantly damps the flow in a long channel for both
laminar and turbulent simulations. Building on this finding, this paper not
only thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel
flow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in
the gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical
numerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient
consistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background
pressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To
comprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its
potential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical
experiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the
residue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven
free-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid
standing wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the
pressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length,
resolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient
correction technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be
effective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability
is fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is
tested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting
the necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high
background pressure.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

Conclusion: MoRPI - PINN是轻量级方法，可在边缘设备实现，适用于典型移动机器人应用。

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

time partial differential equations of the two-step solution procedure used
here. To address the low-frequency instability, we incorporate a generalized
tree-cotree gauge that removes the singularity of the curl-curl operator,
ensuring robustness even in the static limit. Numerical results on academic and

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

### [163] [Machine Learning Workflow for Analysis of High-Dimensional Order Parameter Space: A Case Study of Polymer Crystallization from Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17980)
*Elyar Tourani,Brian J. Edwards,Bamin Khomami*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 提出集成机器学习工作流量化聚合物系统结晶度，用少量序参量可重现结晶标签，C - 指数分类性能高，支持结晶不同阶段假设，提供序参量选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前聚合物结晶途径识别基于单一序参量预设截止点，对截止点敏感且有系统偏差，需准确量化结晶度的方法。

Method: 用高维特征向量表示原子，低维嵌入暴露潜在结构指纹，无监督聚类识别原子类型，有监督学习确定最小序参量集，定义C - 指数。

Result: 用三个序参量可重现结晶标签，C - 指数分类性能超0.98（AUC），单或多快照训练模型可实时计算结晶度。

Conclusion: 该工作流为序参量选择提供数据驱动策略，可监测大规模聚合物模拟中的结构转变。

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对不同交流策略对智能体解题影响的系统评估，而有效交流策略能提高协作解题效率并促进其在教育中的应用。

Method: 使用OpenAI GPT - 4o模型，在双智能体、基于聊天的数学解题环境中研究四种交流模式（师生互动、对等协作、互惠同伴教学和批判性辩论），并在MATH数据集上进行评估。

Result: 双智能体设置优于单智能体，对等协作准确率最高，陈述、确认和提示等对话行为在协作解题中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架虽能增强计算任务，但有效交流策略对解决AI教育中的复杂问题至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Conclusion: 提供了可扩展、透明的AI增强定性研究模型，为生成式AI在教育实践中的角色演变提供基础见解。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

Conclusion: PosterMate是有效的原型工具，有捕捉观点和合成反馈的潜力。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

Method: 运用先进文本挖掘技术，包括BERTopic建模、情感、情绪和态度分析。

Result: 识别出100个主题，发现KOL在塑造愿景和影响当下辩论中的双重作用，积极情绪如希望占主导，不同主题引发不同情绪。

Conclusion: KOL作为社会叙事的调解者，在不确定时期引导公众对新兴技术的关注，增进对技术介导情境中预期话语的理解。

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CPU的大语言模型服务方案未考虑不同阶段工作负载差异，优化不足。

Method: 提出硬件中心的CPU服务引擎Sandwich，为预填充和解码阶段使用不同执行计划并分别优化。

Result: 在多平台评估，平均吞吐量提升2.01倍，单序列服务多项延迟指标表现好，连续批处理服务中吞吐量显著提升，生成的GEMM内核性能优且调优成本低。

Conclusion: Sandwich能有效提升基于CPU的大语言模型服务性能。

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

Method: 1. 通过强制对齐和交叉熵损失简化训练；2. 使用独立的特定任务预测器；3. 利用角色分割后验活动影响语音识别解码。

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究病理基础模型对非生物学特征的鲁棒性，开发PathoROB基准，实验揭示评估模型存在鲁棒性不足，强调鲁棒性评估对临床应用的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学基础模型易学习非生物学技术特征，给临床部署带来风险，需研究其对非生物学特征的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入量化基础模型鲁棒性的措施，开发包含三个新指标和四个数据集的PathoROB基准。

Result: 评估的20个基础模型均存在鲁棒性不足，非鲁棒模型表示会导致下游诊断错误，使用更鲁棒模型和事后鲁棒化可降低错误风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估对病理基础模型临床应用前的验证至关重要，未来模型开发应将鲁棒性作为核心设计原则，PathoROB可为生物医学领域评估提供蓝图。

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

Motivation: 3D卷积操作的参数高效表示研究有限，需要解决3D U - Net的DDPMs在MRI图像生成中的参数高效微调问题。

Method: 提出TenVOO方法，利用张量网络建模，用低维张量表示3D卷积核。

Result: 在三个脑MRI数据集上评估，TenVOO在MS - SSIM上达到了最先进性能，只需原模型0.3%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: TenVOO是一种有效的参数高效微调方法，能在少参数情况下捕获空间依赖。

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Motivation: 土壤氮时空变异性大，为精准估计葡萄叶氮浓度并进行精准施肥，以满足植物需求。

Method: 采集不同葡萄园、不同生长阶段的四种葡萄品种的400 - 1000nm高光谱图像，经图像处理后用两种特征选择方法确定对叶氮浓度响应的最佳光谱带，用这些光谱带训练和测试梯度提升和XGBoost两种机器学习模型。

Result: 叶级和冠层级数据集选定的光谱带在关键区域（500 - 525nm、650 - 690nm、750 - 800nm和900 - 950nm）有一致性，模型在冠层级数据R方为0.49，叶级数据R方为0.57。

Conclusion: 实地高光谱成像结合光谱数据的特征选择和机器学习技术在监测葡萄园氮状态方面有潜力。

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719
high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with
20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels
per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports
multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in
TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and
facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice
through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LPWAN实现大规模可扩展性具有挑战，新兴物联网和CPS应用有此需求。

Method: 推进SNOW技术，利用D - OFDM子载波，开发Gold码PN序列，使基站和传感器能在同一子载波及不同子载波上并发处理数据。

Result: 能在SNOW中实现约9倍可扩展性，基站数据收集及时，传感器节能。

Conclusion: 可满足新兴物联网和CPS应用对大量传感器长电池寿命及时间敏感决策的需求。

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

Method: 假设无知和Rumsfeld无知包装算子中隐含知识算子的两种可达关系不同，其中一个是另一个的任意子集。

Result: 得到了不同适当双框架类上的公理化结果。

Conclusion: 该框架能避免可定义性问题并保留之前大部分有效性，可用于分析Fine的结果。

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来多模态脑编码基准建立了简单、可扩展的基线。

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar框架能有效解决3D头像生成中重建与动画平衡问题，有较好效果。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Conclusion: 为设备端推理铺平道路，是迈向逼真、模型驱动数字角色的重要一步。

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Conclusion: 所提出的半自动化标注框架能有效探索和解释大语言模型嵌入空间拓扑结构的语言属性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

TL;DR: 首次应用监督机器学习预测两表面平面几何结构中的多电子倍增敏感性，对比不同模型性能，展示了基于机器学习的多电子倍增预测的前景与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测不同材料和运行状态下的多电子倍增敏感性是加速器组件设计和射频工程中的关键且计算密集型挑战。

Method: 使用模拟生成的涵盖六种不同二次电子产额材料轮廓的数据集训练回归模型（随机森林、极端树、极端梯度提升和多层感知器），用交并比、结构相似性指数和皮尔逊相关系数评估性能。

Result: 基于树的模型在不同材料域的泛化能力上始终优于多层感知器；使用结合交并比和结构相似性指数的标量化目标函数训练的多层感知器优于单目标损失函数训练的；主成分分析显示某些材料性能下降源于特征空间分布不连续。

Conclusion: 证明了基于机器学习的多电子倍增预测的前景与局限，为先进射频和加速器系统设计的数据驱动建模奠定基础。

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Motivation: 基于之前药物研究智能体AI概念框架，对Tippy多智能体系统实现进行全面技术分析。

Method: 采用分布式微服务架构，含五个专业智能体，通过OpenAI Agents SDK编排协调，经MCP访问实验室工具；系统架构涉及工具集成、异步通信和配置管理；生产部署用Kubernetes容器编排、Docker容器化和CI/CD管道；集成向量数据库和Envoy反向代理。

Abstract: Building on the conceptual framework presented in our previous work on
agentic AI for pharmaceutical research, this paper provides a comprehensive
technical analysis of Tippy's multi-agent system implementation for drug
discovery laboratory automation. We present a distributed microservices
architecture featuring five specialized agents (Supervisor, Molecule, Lab,
Analysis, and Report) that coordinate through OpenAI Agents SDK orchestration
and access laboratory tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system
architecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous
communication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through
Git-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes
container orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD
pipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates
vector databases for RAG functionality and employs an Envoy reverse proxy for
secure external access. This work demonstrates how specialized AI agents can
effectively coordinate complex laboratory workflows while maintaining security,
scalability, reliability, and integration with existing laboratory
infrastructure through standardized protocols.

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟OLG模型探讨印尼公共债务问题，发现增加公共债务使经济更不稳定，减债会降低社会福利，政策上应谨慎对待。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在负利率 - 增长差异情况下，更高公共债务可能并非成本高昂的问题。

Method: 在不确定情况下模拟Blanchard（2019）引入的OLG模型，基于2004 - 2019年利率 - 增长差异历史数据修改模型参数。

Result: 采用印尼利率参数实施Blanchard（2019）分析时财政共识不成立，增加公共债务使经济更不稳定、高风险；修改其他因素支持初始发现；出现债务爆炸威胁时，减债会降低社会福利。

Conclusion: 政策上要谨慎对待增加公共债务的机会，避免可能的严重后果。

Abstract: This study contributes to the discussion about how higher public debt may not
be costly because of the negative interest rate-growth differentials by
simulating OLG models introduced by Blanchard (2019) under uncertainty, showing
debt and welfare dynamics in two scenarios: intergenerational transfers and
debt rollovers in the case of Indonesia. The simulation is done by modifying
the model parameters based on interest rate-growth differentials historic data
from 2004-2019. It is found that the fiscal consensus does not hold when
implementing Blanchard (2019) analysis with Indonesian-based rate parameters.
Increasing public debt makes the economy more volatile and high risk. Modifying
other factors supports the initial finding, with lower initial endowment
diminishing the benefits of public debt and higher capital share under
Cobb-Douglas. When the threat of debt explosion appears, efforts to reduce debt
share will reduce the welfare of the society. The policy implication is to be
careful of the opportunity. Increasing public debt may not be the way to go,
avoiding possible dire consequences.

Motivation: 探究中国早期高科技初创企业创新活动与企业生产率的关系，验证创新如何转化为经济产出。

Method: 使用2020 - 2024年专利记录、研发支出、资本估值和企业绩效等专有数据集进行研究，包括机制分析和异质性分析。

Result: 专利产出对企业收入和利润无显著贡献，主要起信号作用；研发支出与企业绩效正相关，资本流入和估值是研发投资关键驱动因素，研发影响在部分子行业和深圳企业更明显。

Conclusion: 挑战专利产出是创新成功通用指标的假设，强调新兴市场创新 - 绩效联系的情境依赖性。

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between innovation activities and
firm-level productivity among early-stage high-tech startups in China. Using a
proprietary dataset encompassing patent records, R&D expenditures, capital
valuation, and firm performance from 2020 to 2024, we examine whether and how
innovation, measured by patents and R&D input, translates into economic output.
Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not
significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms.
Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling
function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true
innovative productivity. In contrast, R&D expenditure shows a consistent and
positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we
explore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and
policy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&D, identifying capital
inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&D investment. Finally, heterogeneity
analysis indicates that the effects of R&D are more pronounced in
sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms
based in Shenzhen. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that patent
output is a universal indicator of innovation success and underscore the
context-dependent nature of innovation-performance linkages in emerging
markets.

Motivation: 强化学习应用于经济建模时，均衡理论假设与学习主体的涌现行为存在根本冲突，且存在参数偏差问题。

Method: 先在具有凹生产的搜索 - 匹配模型中展示差异，提出校准的平均场强化学习框架，嵌入代表性主体并调整成本函数，采用迭代算法。

Result: 迭代算法收敛到自洽的不动点，主体策略与竞争均衡一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算社会科学领域经济系统中学习主体建模提供了易处理且理论合理的方法。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

Motivation: 探究绿色领域未来技术进步消息的宏观经济效应，深化对特定技术新闻冲击影响的理解，为宏观经济和环境政策提供信息。

Method: 利用美国上市公司获得的绿色专利经济价值，通过对贝叶斯向量自回归模型（BVAR）的创新进行旋转识别绿色技术新闻冲击，并将冲击分解为两个正交分量。

Result: 识别出的冲击分为共同技术分量和绿色创新特有分量，特有分量会带来通胀压力和股价下跌，暗示存在绿色转型新闻机制。

Conclusion: 聚焦绿色创新有助于加深对特定技术新闻冲击影响的理解，对宏观经济和环境政策有实际重要意义。

Abstract: This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of news about future
technological advancements in the green sector. Utilizing the economic value of
green patents granted to publicly listed companies in the U.S., we identify
green technology news shocks via a convenient and meaningful rotation of the
innovations from a Bayesian Vector Autorregresion Model (BVAR). These shocks
are decomposed into two orthogonal components: i) a common technological
component shared by both green and non-green innovation, that reproduces
response patterns similar to those expected from a technology news shock with
long-run impacts on productivity; and ii) an idiosyncratic component to green
innovation inducing inflationary pressures and stock price reductions. The
responses to the idiosyncratic component suggest the existence of a green
transition news mechanism related to expectations of more rigorous carbon
policies or stricter environmental standards in the future. The focus on green
innovation deepens our understanding about the effect of technology-specific
news shocks and provides information of practical importance for macroeconomic
and environmental policies.

Motivation: 探究有组织犯罪渗透市议会对意大利市级环境政策的影响。

Method: 利用1991年第164号法律允许的，解散被黑手党渗透的市议会并由外部委员会替代这一外生冲击进行研究。

Result: 解散被渗透市议会后，环境政策在多方面改善，如可持续发展和环境资本支出增加、综合水系统当前支出增加、分类垃圾百分比增加，且有显著溢出效应。结果对不同对照组设定稳健。

Conclusion: 有必要打击有组织犯罪以改善受其影响地区的环境状况。

Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of organized crime infiltration in city
councils on environmental policies implemented in Italy at the municipal level.
To this purpose, we exploit the exogenous shock of the removal of a city
council infiltrated by the mafia and its substitution with an external
Commission, allowed in Italy by the law 164/1991. Our results suggest that
after dissolution, environmental policies improve in several dimensions: the
capital expenditure for sustainable development and the environment increases;
the current expenditure on integrated water system increases; the percentage of
sorted waste increases because, as we show, public expenditure is reallocated
toward sorted waste at the expenses of unsorted waste. These results are robust
to different specifications of the control group. In addition, we find
significant spillover effects: the dissolution of infiltrated city councils
implies an improvement in environmental policies in adjacent municipalities.
Our results have a straightforward policy implication, the need to combat
organized crime as a way to improve the environmental conditions of the
territories plagued by its pervasive presence.

Motivation: 深度学习用于mMIMO预编码训练需高质量本地数据集，收集困难，旨在解决数据可用性和训练复杂性问题。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的基础模型，引入数据增强方法，通过计算预训练特征提取器输出的余弦相似度找训练样本。

Result: 零样本部署时，在相同能耗下，模型显著优于迫零算法，以八分之一复杂度接近加权最小均方误差性能。

Conclusion: 解决实际DL方案的数据和复杂度挑战，可助力高层算法控制能效、谱效和公平性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

Motivation: 支持学生发展有效诊断推理是教育领域挑战，新手有认知偏差，SBL可应对但教学活动最佳顺序不明。

Method: 在在线SBL环境PharmaSim中采用组间设计开展研究。

Result: 两种教学类型都有益，但PS - I在迁移任务中表现显著更好。

Conclusion: 在在线SBL环境中，先解决问题再进行诊断策略教学（PS - I）更有利于学习迁移。

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

Motivation: 自动驾驶高效可扩展性很重要，但现有研究缺乏跨多种配置和环境的可扩展性，需解决通用能力在不同系统和环境的可扩展适应挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，第一阶段通过特定国家奖励模型针对特定环境微调，第二阶段进行车辆特定的迁移学习促进系统适应和决策验证。

Result: 提出了一个整合技术和社会政治方面的数据驱动过程。

Conclusion: 该概念能实现跨技术、法律、文化和伦理差异的有效可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

Conclusion: 通过低密度奇偶校验码在二元对称信道上的实验，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Result: 分析了高斯和二进制情况的最优解，可作为评估极小极大训练方法的基准。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能在隐私保护数据共享中平衡重建者失真和对手损失。

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

Conclusion: 这些发展为6G的AI原生收发器奠定了基础，同时也指出资源高效监控等方面的开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同语言版本维基百科独立编写更新，导致事实不一致，影响百科及依赖其的AI系统。

Method: 开发收集、对齐和分析维基百科多语言文章表格的方法，定义不一致类别，用定量和定性指标评估多语言对齐。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但开展了相关研究分析。

Conclusion: 研究成果对事实验证、多语言知识交互和可靠AI系统设计有影响。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究六种AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的检测效果，及对抗攻击影响，还将DeepSeek用作检测器，部分工具表现不一，人类化攻击影响大，Few - shot和CoT提示准确率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型引发写作诚信问题催生AI检测技术，对抗攻击影响检测，此前研究多针对知名模型，缺乏对DeepSeek的研究，因此开展本研究。

Method: 用六种通用AI检测工具检测DeepSeek生成文本，使其受对抗攻击；将DeepSeek作为检测器，采用few - shot提示和CoT推理分类文本；收集人类问答对，生成对应AI样本，应用对抗技术增加样本挑战检测器。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks对原始和改写的DeepSeek文本检测表现近乎完美，其他工具结果不稳定；人类化攻击影响最大；Few - shot和CoT提示准确率高。

Conclusion: 不同AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本检测效果不同，对抗攻击尤其是人类化攻击会降低检测准确率，Few - shot和CoT提示可让DeepSeek作为检测器取得较好分类效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数（BCC）指标，生成数据集测量BCC，比较多模型的BCC与模型参数数量、训练数据量和基准测试分数。

Result: 有证据支持更大、能力更强的预训练语言模型赋予的可信度更符合贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解和管理大语言模型有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Abstract: Despite being spoken by millions of people, Tigrinya remains severely
underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. This work
presents a comprehensive survey of NLP research for Tigrinya, analyzing over 40
studies spanning more than a decade of work from 2011 to 2025. We
systematically review the current state of computational resources, models, and
applications across ten distinct downstream tasks, including morphological
processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and question-answering.
Our analysis reveals a clear trajectory from foundational, rule-based systems
to modern neural architectures, with progress consistently unlocked by resource
creation milestones. We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's
morphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising
research directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual
transfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both
a comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya

Motivation: 现有L&E方法编辑大规模知识时可能损害大语言模型通用能力、导致遗忘编辑事实，需更好解决方案。

Method: 将现有线性L&E方法建模为查询KV数据库，提出NeuralDB框架，用非线性门控检索模块显式表示编辑事实。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上编辑1万事实的实验显示，NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性等方面表现出色，保留整体性能；扩展到10万事实仍有效。

Conclusion: NeuralDB是一种高效的大语言模型知识编辑框架，能有效编辑知识并保留模型通用能力，扩展性能好。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

TL;DR: 本文提出推理时转向方法GrAInS，可跨语言和视觉 - 语言模型工作，在多项任务上优于微调及现有转向基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时转向方法存在依赖固定全局干预向量、忽视输入标记因果影响、未充分利用梯度信息等问题，需改进。

Method: 使用基于对比梯度的归因方法识别最具影响力的标记，构建转向向量，在推理时调整隐藏激活并归一化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA上准确率提升13.22%，在MMHal - Bench上幻觉率从0.624降至0.514，在SPA - VL上对齐胜率提高8.11%。

Conclusion: GrAInS能在不重新训练或辅助监督下，对模型行为进行细粒度、可解释和模块化控制，且保留模型流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语停顿预测方法依赖大量人工标注，存在人力和成本问题，且语音领域数据获取受语音因素影响复杂，而大语言模型在解决NLP数据挑战上有成效，因此探索其在短语停顿预测中的应用。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成合成短语停顿标注，与传统标注对比，评估其在多语言中的有效性。

Result: 基于大语言模型的合成数据生成有效缓解了短语停顿预测中的数据挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为语音领域可行解决方案具有潜力。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Motivation: 现有评估基准多关注SLMs执行复杂任务能力，未契合真实对话场景，需设计新基准评估SLMs在真实中文交互场景作为对话代理的有效性。

Result: 实验表明现有SLMs在自然对话任务上有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 希望TELEVAL成为以用户为中心的评估框架，推动对话型SLMs发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Motivation: 现有口语语言模型大多仅将语音视为语言内容载体，忽略了副语言和说话人特征线索，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入GOAT - SLM，采用双模态头部架构解耦语言建模和声学实现，提出模块化分阶段训练策略，利用大规模语音文本语料逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话人特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL多维度评估基准上，GOAT - SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，在处理情感、方言变化和年龄敏感交互方面优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: 强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应和具有社会意识的口语语言系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在临床决策有价值，但在HIV管理中的应用存在准确性等问题且相关研究少，需评估其在HIV管理中的能力。

Method: 引入HIVMedQA基准，评估7个通用和3个医学专业大语言模型，运用提示工程，采用词汇相似度和以大语言模型为评判的方法从多维度评估。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro多数维度表现最佳，两个顶尖模型为专有模型，问题复杂度增加性能下降，医学微调模型不总优于通用模型，模型大小不能可靠预测性能，推理和理解比事实回忆更难，存在认知偏差。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估，确保大语言模型安全有效地集成到临床护理中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Motivation: Transformer文本嵌入模型中的粘性标记会破坏嵌入可靠性，影响下游任务性能，因此需要对其进行研究。

Method: 提出基于句子和标记过滤的Sticky Token Detector（STD）检测方法，应用于40个检查点和14个模型族。

Result: 发现868个粘性标记，其来源多样，对聚类和检索等下游任务有显著负面影响，会主导模型内部表示。

Conclusion: 未来文本嵌入应用中需要更好的分词策略和模型设计来减轻粘性标记的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多项选择任务中可能利用选项位置或标签的固有偏差获得虚高分数，而非真正理解，需要测量和减轻这种选择偏差。

Method: 通过反复调用无语义内容的空提示估计模型的位置偏差分布，根据反偏差分布重新分配答案槽，避免语义相似的干扰项与答案相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE在稳定性能提升方面始终优于现有去偏方法，对正确选项有更清晰的置信分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE框架为提高大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新的标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Result: GMTP能消除超90%投毒内容，保留相关文档，在不同数据集和对抗设置下保持检索和生成性能。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种有效检测和过滤RAG中对抗性文档的方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Result: 2024版向量包含新的文化和语言相关词汇，在类比和相似度等结构任务表现相当，在近期依赖时间的NER数据集上表现更好。

Conclusion: 2024版英语GloVe模型更适应当前语言使用，文档更完善，性能有提升。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接语音翻译（ST）模型利用翻译知识时受无关噪声干扰且无法充分利用知识，准确翻译术语仍是挑战。

Method: 提出定位聚焦方法，先定位含术语语音片段构建翻译知识，再关联音频和文本模态的翻译知识与话语及假设。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语，提升术语翻译成功率，保持稳健的整体翻译性能。

Conclusion: 所提定位聚焦方法能有效解决现有ST模型问题，提升术语翻译效果。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

TL;DR: 提出开源包CLEAR用于大语言模型错误分析，能生成反馈、量化问题并提供交互仪表盘，还进行了案例展示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估范式只能给出单一分数或排名，无法说明模型表现好坏的具体原因，需要改进。

Method: 开发CLEAR包，先生成单实例文本反馈，再创建系统级错误问题并量化其普遍性，提供交互仪表盘进行综合分析。

Result: 对RAG和数学基准进行了CLEAR分析，并通过用户案例展示了其效用。

Conclusion: CLEAR包可有效进行大语言模型的错误分析。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型处理结构化数据能力有限，阿拉伯语因资源和语言特性在表格数据基准方面缺乏代表性，需填补此空白。

Method: 采用混合流程，先用大语言模型生成内容，再由人类专家过滤验证以保证数据集质量；还提出使用自我审议机制的全自动评估框架。

Conclusion: 研究提供了有价值的公开资源和评估框架，有助于加速处理和分析阿拉伯语结构化数据的基础模型的发展。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Method: 搜索多个数据库收集相关文献，对其中94篇进行定量分析。

Result: 2018年后合成医学文本生成受关注，主要目的多样，Transformer架构尤其是GPTs是主要技术，评估有四个方面，实用性评估最常用。合成文本可辅助下游任务、改善数据问题，但隐私有隐患。

Conclusion: 合成医学文本生成虽有隐私问题，但能加速工作流和管道开发，减少数据传输法律流程。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

TL;DR: 提出GraDe方法将稀疏依赖图集成到LLM注意力机制，实验显示其在复杂数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs处理表格数据时，自注意力机制会分散对关键特征关系的关注，因为表格数据存在稀疏特征依赖。

Method: 提出GraDe方法，通过轻量级动态图学习模块，利用外部提取的函数依赖引导，在LLM注意力机制中优先处理关键特征交互并抑制无关交互。

Result: 在不同真实数据集实验中，GraDe在复杂数据集上比现有基于LLM的方法最多高12%，在合成数据质量上与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: GraDe方法侵入性小且有效，为基于LLM的结构感知表格数据建模提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Result: 在Multi30K数据集和WMT基准测试中，GIIFT超现有方法，实现无图像推理的最优效果。

Conclusion: GIIFT在归纳式无图像推理方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

Conclusion: AQuilt是一种有效的构建专业领域指令调优数据的方法，具有成本低和数据相关性高的优势。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Result: 能为GSMHard和MATH等具有挑战性的数学数据集问题生成最先进的特定查询提示。

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架有效统一提示优化方法，可提升大语言模型推理能力。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Motivation: 现有 3D 软件生成方法存在不能修改特定元素、难以处理复杂约束等问题。

Method: 提出 Scenethesis 方法，基于 ScenethesisLang 中间表示，将 3D 软件合成分解为多阶段。

Result: Scenethesis 能准确捕获超 80% 用户需求，满足超 90% 硬约束，视觉评估分数较现有方法提升 42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis 在 3D 软件生成上表现出色，能处理复杂约束，提升合成效果。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上显著提升识别准确率和鲁棒性，取得更好的WAR和UAR，泛化性强。

Conclusion: HDF框架能有效解决DFER中的样本异质性问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查应用有潜力，但存在潜在偏见，评估和改进此类系统公平性很重要，且评估数据集需有代表性。

Method: 利用最先进的GenAI LightningDiT模型评估公开可用的黑色素瘤分类器。

Result: 用高度逼真的合成数据进行公平性评估是有前景的方向，但当评估用的黑色素瘤检测模型训练数据与合成图像基础数据集不同时，验证公平性变得困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用合成数据评估和提升医疗成像GenAI系统公平性提供了有价值的新途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出改进的GRR - CoCa模型，结合多种技术，在多个数据集上显著优于Baseline CoCa，证明改进架构提升性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领先的基础多模态模型架构在复杂性上落后于当代大语言模型，需改进。

Method: 将高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入融入文本解码器和视觉Transformer编码器，构建GRR - CoCa模型，并与Baseline CoCa对比，用标准预训练和微调流程在对比和生成任务上进行基准测试。

Result: GRR - CoCa在预训练数据集和三个微调数据集上显著优于Baseline CoCa，预训练和微调的对比损失、困惑度和CoCa损失均有改善。

Conclusion: GRR - CoCa的改进架构能提升视觉 - 语言领域的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法在应对复杂定制化深度伪造时，在泛化性和抗恶意攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，威胁媒体真实性。

Method: 将图像与VLLM文本解释在基于图的框架中整合，把图像划分为补丁，构建图像和文本图，用GNN进行分析，在空间和频率域进行多级特征提取。

Result: 在泛化评估中平均F1分数从72.45%提升到98.32%；召回率比其他方法提高11.1%；面对针对性攻击时分类性能下降控制在4%以内。

Conclusion: ViGText利用详细的视觉和文本分析为检测深度伪造设定了新标准，有助于确保媒体真实性和信息完整性。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

TL;DR: 当前AI生成视频在长视频场景过渡上有问题，提出TAV数据集，实验表明该数据集可提升模型场景过渡理解等能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在生成多场景长视频时难以实现连贯场景过渡，且多数开源模型训练数据集为单场景视频，限制了其多场景处理能力。

Method: 提出包含多个场景过渡的预处理视频片段的TAV数据集，并进行后训练。

Result: 在TAV数据集上进行后训练，提升了基于提示的场景过渡理解能力，缩小了所需场景和生成场景的差距，且保持了图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集有助于解决AI生成多场景长视频时的场景过渡问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EUS图像噪声、低对比度等问题使全监督深度学习模型分割胰腺肿瘤易出错且依赖大量专家标注数据。

Method: 基于BiomedCLIP文本编码器进行文本提示学习，结合基于LoRA的SAM架构调整，仅调整0.86%的总参数。

Result: 在公开数据集上，自动提示下Dice为82.69%、归一化表面距离（NSD）为85.28%；手动几何提示下Dice为83.10%、NSD为85.70%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM - EUS是基于SAM的医学图像分割中首次结合提示学习的尝试，为EUS自动分割提供实用方案。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 高质量冷启动数据和难度控制的强化学习对模型性能很重要，公开资源以促进研究和工业应用。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

TL;DR: 提出Free - Energy Posterior Network框架用于检测分布外样本，联合建模分布不确定性，在多个基准测试验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检测分布外样本的方法如MC Dropout常只关注模型或数据不确定性，无法契合分布外检测的语义目标。

Method: 提出Free - Energy Posterior Network框架，有基于自由能的密度估计器和后验网络内的损失，与RPL框架集成。

Result: 超越事后能量阈值法，网络可利用Beta分布方差学习分布外区域，实现有语义意义且计算高效的不确定性感知分割。

Conclusion: 方法在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly等真实世界基准测试中有效。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: 提出Diff - UMamba架构用于医学图像分割，在多数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀缺场景下深度学习模型过拟合、泛化能力差的问题，提升医学图像分割效果。

Method: 结合UNet框架和mamba机制，引入Noise Reduction Module（NRM）采用信号差分策略抑制噪声。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上性能提升1 - 3%，在有限数据条件的BraTS - 21数据集和内部NSCLC数据集上分别有良好表现和4 - 5%的提升。

Conclusion: Diff - UMamba架构能提高医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在低数据场景下效果显著。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Method: 引入耀斑和噪声模拟模块生成低光配对深度数据集，提出利用光照引导和多尺度特征融合的低光参数高效微调策略。

Result: 在nuScenes - Night和RobotCar - Night数据集上实现了最先进的深度估计性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法在有限训练数据和计算资源下有效。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat

Conclusion: 所提方法能提升ISTD模型对各种挑战的恢复力，提高合成样本质量和保真度。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Motivation: 解决现有鸟类物种分类模型在低信噪比或多物种录音场景下表现不佳的问题，因环境噪声、重叠发声和标签缺失等使分类任务具有挑战性。

Method: 将频率信息通过原色添加剂嵌入频谱图中，应用深度学习模型处理频谱图。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息的方法在鸟类物种分类中有效。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for

*Simin Huo,Ning Li*

TL;DR: 提出无位置嵌入的分层视觉变换器Iwin Transformer，在多视觉任务表现强，核心组件可用于图像生成，方法有潜力启发后续研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服Swin Transformer需两个连续块近似全局注意力的局限，实现单模块内全局信息交换。

Method: 通过创新的交错窗口注意力和深度可分离卷积协作，用注意力连接远距令牌、卷积连接相邻令牌。

Result: 在图像分类、语义分割和视频动作识别等任务展现强竞争力，核心组件可替代图像生成中的自注意力模块。

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer的概念和方法有潜力启发未来研究，如视频生成中的Iwin 3D Attention。

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are
available at https://github.com/cominder/Iwin-Transformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字攻击缺乏物理可实现性，物理对抗物体攻击研究不足且可重复性差。

Method: 提出设备无关的标准化框架，抽象关键元素，支持多样方法，提供开源代码和基准协议。

Result: 框架使模拟攻击成功转移到物理LiDAR系统，可进行公平比较并加速研究。

Conclusion: 框架有效，还提供了影响攻击成功的因素见解，推动了对现实世界LiDAR感知对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

TL;DR: 提出名为NLML - HPE的深度学习方法用于有限训练数据下的头部姿态估计，解决标注和实时性能问题，代码和模型开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部姿态估计在计算机视觉应用中很重要，传统方法有局限，且数据集标注存在问题，需有限训练数据下的有效方法。

Method: 结合张量分解（Tucker分解）和前馈神经网络，将头姿估计设为回归问题，用张量分解分离欧拉角子空间，用余弦曲线建模流形，生成精确数据集。

Result: 实现有限训练数据下的实时头部姿态估计，能准确从面部特征点捕捉物体旋转本质。

Conclusion: 提出的NLML - HPE方法在有限训练数据下有效，可解决头姿估计问题，代码和模型开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

TL;DR: 现有3D环境对抗攻击防御机制适应性不足，提出Rein - EAD框架，实验证明其有效且泛化性好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D环境对抗攻击防御机制依赖预设假设，在动态3D场景中适应性不足，需改进。

Method: 引入Rein - EAD框架，采用多步目标平衡预测准确性与熵最小化，有不确定性奖励塑造机制。

Result: 实验表明Rein - EAD大幅降低攻击成功率，保持标准准确率，对未知和自适应攻击有强泛化性。

Conclusion: Rein - EAD适用于3D物体分类、人脸识别和自动驾驶等复杂现实任务。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Motivation: 以往基于SAE特征的模型比较局限于同模态，需跨模态定量比较。

Method: 提出跨SAE特征的定量比较指标，量化不同模型类别个体特征的比较共享性，并对三类21个编码器开展研究。

Result: 可结合多模态训练的编码器重新审视以往研究，量化模型表征或特征共享程度，发现视觉编码器中VLM特定视觉特征与文本编码器共享。

Conclusion: 新工具能有效跨模态比较模型，凸显文本预训练影响。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Conclusion: VideoMind公开可用，能推动深度视频理解相关领域发展，如情感和意图识别。

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Motivation: EDM固定高斯噪声模式限制图像恢复进展，强行注入高斯噪声会破坏退化图像、增加恢复复杂度。

Method: 提出EDA方法，拓展噪声模式自由度，保留EDM模块灵活性，理论证明增加噪声复杂度不增加恢复计算开销。

Result: 在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除三项任务上验证，仅5个采样步骤，EDA优于多数特定任务方法，在偏置场校正和阴影去除上达最优。

Conclusion: EDA方法有效，能在多种噪声场景的图像恢复任务中取得良好效果。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Motivation: 解决低光图像增强中极端光照下降时物体边缘连续性和精细结构细节保留的难题。

Method: 提出DRWKV模型，集成Global Edge Retinex (GER)理论；引入Evolving WKV Attention；设计Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi - SAB)和MS2 - Loss。

Result: 在五个LLIE基准测试中，DRWKV在PSNR、SSIM和NIQE方面表现领先，计算复杂度低，且能提升低光多目标跟踪任务的下游性能。

Conclusion: DRWKV模型在低光图像增强方面有效，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: 现有T2I模型生成的合成图像-文本对有噪声，现有数据修剪技术不适用于合成数据，本文提出SynC框架为零样本图像字幕（ZIC）精炼合成数据集，提升了ZIC模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型生成的图像与输入文本存在语义不对齐问题，现有数据修剪技术不适用于合成数据，需要新方法来精炼合成图像-文本数据集。

Method: SynC框架采用一对多映射策略，为每个文本检索多个候选图像，使用循环一致性启发的对齐评分器选择最佳图像。

Result: SynC在多个标准基准测试中持续且显著提高了各种ZIC模型的性能，在多个场景中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SynC为ZIC提供了一种有效的精炼合成数据的策略。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: 现有基于文本的零样本域适应方法难以捕捉复杂变化且增加适应时间，探索利用图像数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出SIDA方法，先创建源域图像并进行图像翻译生成合成图像，利用其风格特征，引入Domain Mix和Patch Style Transfer模块。

Result: 在多种零样本适应场景，尤其是具有挑战性的领域中达到了最先进的性能，显著减少了整体适应时间。

Conclusion: 所提出的SIDA方法有效且高效，能更好地适应现实世界的变化。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in

TL;DR: 提出LoRA - Leak评估框架检测基于LoRA微调的语言模型在成员推理攻击下的脆弱性，并探索了防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击忽视了预训练模型导致的信息泄露，且人们可能因LoRA微调参数比例小而认为数据对成员推理攻击免疫，需评估其风险。

Method: 引入包含15种成员推理攻击的LoRA - Leak评估框架，应用于三种先进语言模型和三个自然语言处理任务，还探索了四种防御方法。

Result: 基于LoRA微调的语言模型仍易受成员推理攻击，如保守微调设置下AUC为0.775；只有dropout和微调时排除特定层能有效降低风险并保持实用性。

Conclusion: 在“预训练 - 微调”范式下，预训练模型使基于LoRA的语言模型面临更严重的成员推理攻击风险，研究结果可为专业语言模型提供商的数据隐私保护提供指导。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Result: 在14202个实例中，pact成功完成603个，而基线仅完成13个。

Conclusion: pact在混合公式的模型计数上取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

Abstract: We consider the problem of variable selection in Bayesian multivariate linear
regression models, involving multiple response and predictor variables, under
multivariate normal errors. In the absence of a known covariance structure,
specifying a model with a non-diagonal covariance matrix is appealing. Modeling
dependency in the random errors through a non-diagonal covariance matrix is
generally expected to lead to improved estimation of the regression
coefficients. In this article, we highlight an interesting exception: modeling
the dependency in errors can significantly worsen both estimation and
prediction. We demonstrate that Bayesian multi-outcome regression models using
several popular variable selection priors can suffer from poor estimation
properties in low-information settings--such as scenarios with weak signals,
high correlation among predictors and responses, and small sample sizes. In
such cases, the simultaneous estimation of all unknown parameters in the model
becomes difficult when using a non-diagonal covariance matrix. Through
simulation studies and a dataset with measurements from NIR spectroscopy, we
illustrate that a two-step procedure--estimating the mean and the covariance
matrix separately--can provide more accurate estimates in such cases. Thus, a
potential solution to avoid the problem altogether is to routinely perform an
additional analysis with a diagonal covariance matrix, even if the errors are
expected to be correlated.

Motivation: 改进实体解析中后验计算的效率。

Method: 通过将Ewens - Pitman模型的强度参数与样本大小线性缩放得到微聚类Ewens - Pitman模型，利用Ewens - Pitman随机划分和Pitman - Yor过程的相互作用开发变分推理方案。

Result: 所提方法比现有贝叶斯方法快三个数量级，且经验性能有竞争力。

Conclusion: 新模型和推理方案能有效提高实体解析中后验计算的效率。

Abstract: We introduce the microclustering Ewens--Pitman model for random partitions,
obtained by scaling the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model linearly
with the sample size. The resulting random partition is shown to have the
microclustering property, namely: the size of the largest cluster grows
sub-linearly with the sample size, while the number of clusters grows linearly.
By leveraging the interplay between the Ewens--Pitman random partition with the
Pitman--Yor process, we develop efficient variational inference schemes for
posterior computation in entity resolution. Our approach achieves a speed-up of
three orders of magnitude over existing Bayesian methods for entity resolution,
while maintaining competitive empirical performance.

Abstract: Improving Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm efficiency is essential for
enhancing computational speed and inferential accuracy in Bayesian analysis.
These improvements can be effectively achieved using the
ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy (ASIS), an effective means of
achieving such gains. Herein, we provide the first rigorous theoretical
justification for applying ASIS in Bayesian hierarchical panel data models.
Asymptotic analysis demonstrated that when the product of prior variance of
unobserved heterogeneity and cross-sectional sample size N is sufficiently
large, the latent individual effects can be sampled almost independently of
their global mean. This near-independence accounts for ASIS's rapid mixing
behavior and highlights its suitability for modern "tall" panel datasets. We
derived simple inequalities to predict which conventional data augmentation
scheme-sufficient augmentation (SA) or ancillary augmentation (AA)-yields
faster convergence. By interweaving SA and AA, ASIS achieves optimal geometric
rate of convergence and renders the Markov chain for the global mean parameter
asymptotically independent and identically distributed. Monte Carlo experiment
confirm that this theoretical efficiency ordering holds even for small panels
(e.g., N=10). These findings confirm the empirical success of ASIS application
across finance, marketing, and sports, laying the groundwork for its extension
to models with more complex covariate structures and nonGaussian
specifications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示自动猜想系统生成的图论猜想，激发数学家和AI系统探索，并反思机器在数学创造性思维过程中的参与意义。

Method: 利用自动猜想系统	exttt{TxGraffiti}生成猜想，通过对数百个图进行实证验证。

Result: 得到四个简洁、基于自然图不变量的未决猜想，既无法证明也未找到反例。

Conclusion: 这些猜想不仅是数学挑战，还引发对机器在数学发现中作用的思考，鼓励大家参与解决和反思。

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated
conjecturing system \texttt{TxGraffiti}. Each conjecture is concise, grounded
in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of
graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying
both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but
creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and
mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it
means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of
mathematical thought.
