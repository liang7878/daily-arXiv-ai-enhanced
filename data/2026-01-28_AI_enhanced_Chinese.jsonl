This paper presents a case study of integrating three major public chemical repositories: PubChem (176 million compounds), ChEMBL, and eMolecules, to construct a curated dataset for molecular property prediction. We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale. Our results document the progression from an intractable brute-force search algorithm with projected 100-day runtime to a byte-offset indexing architecture achieving 3.2-hour completion-a 740-fold performance improvement through algorithmic complexity reduction from O(NxM) to O(N+M). Systematic validation of 176 million database entries revealed hash collisions in InChIKey molecular identifiers, necessitating pipeline reconstruction using collision-free full InChI strings. We present performance benchmarks, quantify trade-offs between storage overhead and scientific rigor, and compare our approach with alternative large-scale integration strategies.

In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions.

Density-based methods address this ambiguity by favoring repairs that preserve dense, high-quality data regions; however, their effectiveness is limited by density bias from dirty clusters, high computational cost, and uniform attribute weighting. We propose a topology-aware approximate subset repair framework based on a joint density-conflict penalty model. The framework integrates three key components. First, a two-layer conflict detection strategy combines attribute inverted indexes with CFD rule grouping to efficiently identify violations. Second, we introduce EntroCFDensity, a density metric that incorporates information entropy and CFD weights to dynamically adjust attribute importance and reduce homogeneity bias. Third, a conflict degree measure is defined to complement local density, enabling a topology-adaptive penalty mechanism with dynamic weight allocation guided by the coefficient of variation. The conflict graph is further decomposed into independent subgraphs, transforming global repair into tractable local subproblems.

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm (GeoSSA). By integrating Good Nodes Set initialization, a Sine-Cosine Enhanced Producer position update strategy, and a Triangular-Walk Enhanced Edge Sparrow update strategy, GeoSSA significantly improves the global exploration ability, local exploitation efficiency, and convergence stability of the original SSA. To thoroughly validate the effectiveness of GeoSSA, we conducted ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and comparative experiments on 23 benchmark functions against state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GeoSSA achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of average fitness, standard deviation, Wilcoxon tests, and Friedman rankings, with an Overall Effectiveness ($OE$) of 95.65\\%. Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality.

Although existing schedulers strive to optimize performance metrics like task execution times and resource utilization, they provide limited transparency into their decision-making processes or the specific actions developers must take to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In this work, we propose X-Sched, a middleware that uses explainability techniques to generate actionable guidance on resource configurations that makes task execution in containerized environments feasible, under resource and time constraints. X-Sched addresses this gap by integrating counterfactual explanations with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to efficiently identify optimal configurations. This approach not only ensures that tasks are executed in line with performance goals but also gives users clear, actionable insights into the rationale behind scheduling decisions.

Greedy commitment can cascade into irreparable mistakes at large $N$, whereas MCTS-guided local search is accurate but compute-heavy and highly engineered. We instead treat the heatmap as a soft edge prior and cast decoding as probabilistic tour construction under feasibility constraints, where the key is to correct local mis-rankings via inexpensive global coordination. Based on this view, we introduce HeatACO, a plug-and-play Max-Min Ant System decoder whose transition policy is softly biased by the heatmap while pheromone updates provide lightweight, instance-specific feedback to resolve global conflicts; optional 2-opt/3-opt post-processing further improves tour quality. On TSP500/1K/10K, using heatmaps produced by four pretrained predictors, HeatACO+2opt achieves gaps down to 0.11%/0.23%/1.15% with seconds-to-minutes CPU decoding for fixed heatmaps, offering a better quality--time trade-off than greedy decoding and published MCTS-based decoders.

Submitted to IMA Journal of Management Mathematics", "summary": "Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_\u03b8$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_\u03c6$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=\u03c3_t X_t \\nabla_x u_\u03b8$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_\u03b8(0,\\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6FBSDE\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86BSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u770b\u6da8\u548c\u770b\u8dcc\u671f\u6743\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfBSM\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6052\u5b9a\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u884c\u4e3a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6FBSDE\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u5411\u9012\u5f52\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6caa\u6df1300\u6307\u6570\u671f\u6743\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f83BSM\u964d\u4f4eMAE 32.2%\u3001MAPE 35.3%\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u671f\u6743\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u770b\u6da8\u548c\u770b\u8dcc\u671f\u6743\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u671f\u6743\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7b26\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76f4\u89c9\u3002"}}

Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective. While intuitive, these tests require manual evaluation, are difficult to automate, do not facilitate root cause analysis, and incur expensive test environments. In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing. In representative case studies, we demonstrate automated execution and faster root-cause analysis. Collectively, these methods reduce testing costs and improve agent quality through higher coverage, reusability, and earlier defect detection.

We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\u03c7$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $\u03b4_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\\varepsilon_n,\u03b4_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight.

We consider a coopetitive setting where the MaaS platform purchases service capacity from service operators and sells multi-modal trips to travelers following an origin-destination-based pricing scheme; meanwhile, service operators use their remaining capacities to serve single-modal trips. As followers, travelers make both mode choices, including whether to use MaaS, and route choices in the multi-modal transportation network, subject to prices and congestion. Inspired by the dual formulation for traffic assignment problems, we propose a novel single-level variational inequality (VI) formulation by introducing a virtual traffic operator, along with the MaaS platform and multiple service operators. A key advantage of the proposed VI formulation is that it supports parallel solution procedures and thus enables large-scale applications. We prove that an equilibrium solution always exists given the negotiated wholesale price of service capacity. Numerical experiments on a small network further demonstrate that the wholesale price can be tailored to align with varying system-wide objectives. The proposed MaaS system demonstrates potential for creating a \"win-win-win\" outcome -- service operators and travelers are better off compared to the \"without MaaS\" scenario, meanwhile the MaaS platform remains profitable. Such a Pareto-improving regime can be explicitly specified with the wholesale capacity price. Similar conclusions are drawn from the experiment of an extended multi-modal Sioux Falls network, which also validates the scalability of the proposed model and solution algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06MaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005 - \u591a\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u7ea7\u53d8\u5206\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08VI\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6279\u53d1\u4ef7\u683c\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u201c\u4e09\u8d62\u201d\u6f5c\u529b\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u6355\u6349MaaS\u5e73\u53f0\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u548c\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316MaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005 - \u591a\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u7ea7VI\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u534f\u5546\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5bb9\u91cf\u6279\u53d1\u4ef7\u683c\u65f6\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u603b\u662f\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6279\u53d1\u4ef7\u683c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u4e09\u8d62\u201d\uff0c\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u4e09\u8d62\u201d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u53d1\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ef7\u683c\u53ef\u660e\u786e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Using monthly data from 1999 to 2025, we develop a unified framework that integrates Time-Varying Parameter Structural VARs (TVP-SVAR) with advanced dependence structures, including DCC-GARCH, t-copulas, and mixed Clayton--Frank--Gumbel copulas. These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics.

A Mean-Field Game Approach to Model Stablecoin Market Dynamics", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.GT", "econ.GN"], "comment": "9 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "USDC and USDT are the dominant stablecoins pegged to \\$1 with a total market capitalization of over \\$300B and rising. Stablecoins make dollar value globally accessible with secure transfer and settlement. Yet in practice, these stablecoins experience periods of stress and de-pegging from their \\$1 target, posing significant systemic risks. The behavior of market participants during these stress events and the collective actions that either restore or break the peg are not well understood. This paper addresses the question: who restores the peg? We develop a dynamic, agent-based mean-field game framework for fiat-collateralized stablecoins, in which a large population of arbitrageurs and retail traders strategically interacts across explicit primary (mint/redeem) and secondary (exchange) markets during a de-peg episode. The key advantage of this equilibrium formulation is that it endogenously maps market frictions into a market-clearing price path and implied net order flows, allowing us to attribute peg-reverting pressure by channel and to stress-test when a given mechanism becomes insufficient for recovery. Using three historical de-peg events, we show that the calibrated equilibrium reproduces observed recovery half-lives and yields an order flow decomposition in which system-wide stress is predominantly stabilized by primary-market arbitrage, whereas episodes with impaired primary redemption require a joint recovery via both primary and secondary markets. Finally, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of primary-rail frictions identifies a non-linear breakdown threshold. Beyond this point, secondary-market liquidity acts mainly as a second-order amplifier around this primary-market bottleneck.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u8131\u94a9\u65f6\u8c01\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6302\u94a9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u9760\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5957\u5229\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd8\u627e\u51fa\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u9608\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "USDC\u548cUSDT\u7b49\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u94a9\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u8131\u94a9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u6062\u590d\u6302\u94a9\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8c01\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6302\u94a9\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u5957\u5229\u8005\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u5728\u4e00\u7ea7\u548c\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u8131\u94a9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u5747\u8861\u80fd\u91cd\u73b0\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6062\u590d\u534a\u8870\u671f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u538b\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u9760\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5957\u5229\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e00\u7ea7\u8d4e\u56de\u53d7\u635f\u65f6\u9700\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5171\u540c\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u8fd8\u627e\u51fa\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5957\u5229\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u6062\u590d\u6302\u94a9\u4e2d\u8d77\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u5728\u4e00\u7ea7\u5e02\u573a\u74f6\u9888\u5916\u8d77\u4e8c\u9636\u653e\u5927\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We study algorithms with randomized step sizes, considering both auxiliary-variable and marginalized constructions. We show that algorithms with a randomized step size inherit weak Poincar\u00e9 inequalities/spectral gaps from their fixed-step-size counterparts under minimal conditions, and that the marginalized kernel should always be preferred in terms of asymptotic variance to the auxiliary-variable choice if it is implementable. In addition we show that both types of randomization make an algorithm robust to tuning, meaning that spectral gaps decay polynomially as the step size is increasingly poorly chosen. We further show that step-size randomization often preserves high-dimensional scaling limits and algorithmic complexity, while increasing the optimal acceptance rate for Langevin and Hamiltonian samplers when an Exponential or Uniform distribution is chosen to randomize the step size.

These achieve explainability through visualizations of each feature's effect. However, unlike linear model coefficients, uncertainty quantification for the learned univariate functions requires computationally intensive bootstrapping, making it hard to know which features truly matter. We provide an alternative using recent advances in statistical inference for gradient boosting, deriving methods for statistical inference as well as end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Using a moving average instead of a sum of trees (Boulevard regularization) allows the boosting process to converge to a feature-wise kernel ridge regression. This produces asymptotically normal predictions that achieve the minimax-optimal mean squared error for fitting Lipschitz GAMs with $p$ features at rate $O(pn^{-2/3})$, successfully avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We then construct prediction intervals for the response and confidence intervals for each learned univariate function with a runtime independent of the number of datapoints, enabling further explainability within EBMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u5347\u673a\uff08EBMs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u5347\u673a\uff08EBMs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u771f\u6b63\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u5bfc\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\uff08Boulevard\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u6811\u7684\u6c42\u548c\uff0c\u4f7f\u63d0\u5347\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9010\u7279\u5f81\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6b63\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86EBMs\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u5728EBMs\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates.

However, recent work found that IDS's gains are not consistent across all problems. Our analysis reveals that IDS performance is worse for problems containing outliers. IDS systematically favors including outliers in subsets which pushes GP towards finding solutions that overfit to outliers. To address this, we introduce ROIDS (Robust Outlier-Aware Informed Down-Sampling), which excludes potential outliers from the sampling process of IDS. With ROIDS it is possible to keep the advantages of IDS without overfitting to outliers and to compete on a wide range of benchmark problems. This is also reflected in our experiments in which ROIDS shows the desired behavior on all studied benchmark problems. ROIDS consistently outperforms IDS on synthetic problems with added outliers as well as on a wide range of complex real-world problems, surpassing IDS on over 80% of the real-world benchmark problems. Moreover, compared to all studied baseline approaches, ROIDS achieves the best average rank across all tested benchmark problems.

These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review. Finally, our case analysis further identifies key limitations of LLM-based false alarm reduction in industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u817e\u8baf\u5f00\u5c55\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLLM\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u4e0a\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7528LLM\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u817e\u8baf\u4f01\u4e1a\u5b9a\u5236\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u8425\u9500\u670d\u52a1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u542b433\u4e2a\u8b66\u62a5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8bef\u62a5\u666e\u904d\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u529b\uff1bLLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6d88\u966494 - 98%\u8bef\u62a5\u4e14\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u9ad8\uff1bLLM\u6280\u672f\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u8282\u7701\u5927\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u51cf\u5c11\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u8bef\u62a5\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

An advantage of using supersequences as the auxiliary structures is that it allows us to decouple the preprocessing phase from the reconstruction phase in a stronger sense than was possible in previous work, resulting in two separate algorithmic problems for which different solutions may be combined to obtain known and new results.

Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies.

The market is modeled as a relational substrate without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through observation, implemented here as a reduction of relational degrees of freedom followed by a low-dimensional spectral projection. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate and a projected liquidity density around the mid price, from which bid and ask sides emerge as two complementary restrictions. We show that directional liquidity imbalances decompose naturally into a rigid drift of the projected density and a geometric shear mode that deforms the bid--ask structure without inducing price motion. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis, the shear geometry constrains the projected liquidity to a gamma-like functional form, appearing as an integrated-gamma profile in discrete data.

In this paper, we consider the zeroth-order setting where the unnormalized target distribution can be evaluated but its gradient is unavailable for theoretical, practical, or computational reasons. We also assume access to $m$ parallel processors to accelerate convergence. The proposed approach is inspired by modern zeroth-order optimization methods, which mimic gradient-based schemes by replacing the gradient with a zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimator. Our contribution is twofold.

Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.\n  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller.

Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.\n  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metric to estimate contextual coherence.

While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability.

As many social systems may change internally over time, calibration naturally becomes an online task, requiring parameters to be updated continuously to maintain the simulator's fidelity. In this work, the online setting is first formulated as a dynamic optimization problem (DOP), requiring the search for a sequence of optimal parameters that fit the simulator to real system changes. However, in contrast to traditional DOP formulations, online calibration explicitly incorporates the observational data as the driver of environmental dynamics. Due to this fundamental difference, existing Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) methods, despite being extensively studied for black-box DOPs, are ill-equipped to handle such a scenario. As a result, online calibration problems constitute a new set of challenging DOPs. Here, we propose to explicitly learn the posterior distributions of the parameters and the observational data, thereby facilitating both change detection and environmental adaptation of existing EDOs for this scenario. We thus present a pretrained posterior model for implementation, and fine-tune it during the optimization. Extensive tests on both economic and financial simulators verify that the posterior distribution strongly promotes EDOs in such DOPs widely existed in social science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709EDO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347EDO\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66DOPs\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709EDO\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u660e\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347EDO\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66DOPs\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709EDO\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

The new algorithm allows updates of the likelihood calculation in worst case $O(\\log n)$ time with $n$ taxa, as opposed to worst case $O(n)$ time for existing methods. In practice this leads to appreciable improvements in likelihood calculations, the extent of speed-up depending on how balanced or unbalanced the trees are. We explore implications for parallel computing, and show that the approach allows likelihoods to be computed in $O(\\log n)$ parallel time per site, compared to (worst case) $O(n)$ time.

While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters.

Most of these applications call for a communication-constrained setting where vectors, whose mean is to be estimated, have to be compressed before sharing. One could independently encode and decode these to achieve compression, but that overlooks the fact that these vectors are often close to each other. To exploit these similarities, recently Suresh et al., 2022, Jhunjhunwala et al., 2021, Jiang et al, 2023, proposed multiple correlation-aware compression schemes. However, in most cases, the correlations have to be known for these schemes to work. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of graceful degradation of these correlation-aware compression schemes with increasing dissimilarity is limited to only the $\\ell_2$-error in the literature. In this paper, we propose four different collaborative compression schemes that agnostically exploit the similarities among vectors in a distributed setting. Our schemes are all simple to implement and computationally efficient, while resulting in big savings in communication. The analysis of our proposed schemes show how the $\\ell_2$, $\\ell_\\infty$ and cosine estimation error varies with the degree of similarity among vectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u8282\u7701\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6848\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill.

In the resulting election, the candidate space consists of all feasible matchings, whose exponential size renders standard algorithms for identifying socially desirable outcomes computationally infeasible. We study whether the computational tractability of finding such outcomes can be regained by exploiting the matching structure of the candidate space.

An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs.

On the CIFAR-10, LuminaNet achieves top-1 accuracy improvements of 11.19%, 5.46% over LeNet-5 and AlexNet, respectively, outperforming MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and DeiT-Tiny among MLP/ViT architectures. On the TinyStories text generation task, LuminaNet attains a perplexity of 8.4, comparable to a single-layer GPT-2-style Transformer, while reducing computational cost by approximately 25% and peak memory usage by nearly 50%.

Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods.

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\u0398(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5b9a\u5b58\u50a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6d88\u9664\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u68c0\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76k - \u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6240\u9700\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "k\u81f3\u591a\u4e3a\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e00\u534a\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0ck\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8550%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b58\u50a8 - \u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The prior theoretical results replace this key step in Muon with an exact SVD-based polar factor. We prove that Muon with Newton-Schulz converges to a stationary point at the same rate as the SVD-polar idealization, up to a constant factor for a given number $q$ of Newton-Schulz steps. We further analyze this constant factor and prove that it converges to 1 doubly exponentially in $q$ and improves with the degree of the polynomial used in Newton-Schulz for approximating the orthogonalization direction. We also prove that Muon removes the typical square-root-of-rank loss compared to its vector-based counterpart, SGD with momentum. Our results explain why Muon with a few low-degree Newton-Schulz steps matches exact-polar (SVD) behavior at a much faster wall-clock time and explain how much momentum matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz benefits over the vector-based optimizer.

Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations.

Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC.

While adversarial problems are common, classical QD cannot be easily applied to them, as both the fitness and the behavior depend on the opposing solutions. Recently, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME) has been proposed to coevolve both sides of an adversarial problem by alternating the execution of a multi-task QD algorithm against previous elites, called tasks. The original algorithm selects new tasks based on a behavioral criterion, which may lead to undesired dynamics due to inter-side dependencies. In addition, comparing sets of solutions cannot be done directly using classical QD measures due to side dependencies. In this paper, we (1) use an inter-variants tournament to compare the sets of solutions, ensuring a fair comparison, with 6 measures of quality and diversity, and (2) propose two tournament-informed task selection methods to promote higher quality and diversity at each generation.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff08IPBC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u805a\u7c7b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5229\u7528\u5206\u6790\u8005\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa IPBC \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "IPBC \u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u76f8\u4e92\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.\n  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension.

While most fairness research focuses on supervised learning, fairness in policy learning remains less explored. Because policy learning is interventional, it induces two distinct fairness targets: action fairness (equitable action assignments) and outcome fairness (equitable downstream consequences). Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds. Our framework is flexible and accommodates various commonly used fairness notions. Extensive simulations demonstrate improved performance relative to competing methods. In applications to a motor third-party liability insurance dataset and an entrepreneurship training dataset, DFL substantially improves both action and outcome fairness while incurring only a modest reduction in overall value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u884c\u52a8\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u884c\u52a8\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u5904\u7406\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b57\u5178\u5e8f\u52a0\u6743\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u9669\u548c\u521b\u4e1a\u57f9\u8bad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u6574\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u9002\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "DFL\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \\framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics.

In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca C++ \u7684 PIMPL \u60ef\u7528\u6cd5\u4e3a Python \u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u5728 Python \u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5229\u5f0a\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "Python \u5e93\u9700\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a33\u5b9a\u516c\u5171 API\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f7f\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u5c01\u88c5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca C++ \u7684 PIMPL \u60ef\u7528\u6cd5\u4e3a Python \u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7f6e\u4e8e Python \u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u548c\u79d1\u5b66 Python \u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Python \u7248 PIMPL \u53ef\u9694\u79bb\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u652f\u6301\u61d2\u52a0\u8f7d\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u66ff\u4ee3\u540e\u7aef\u4e14\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u516c\u5171 API\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5229\u5f0a\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u578b\u957f\u671f Python \u5e93\u4e2d\u4f55\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model.

First, we prove the existence of a phase transition phenomenon for the clique problem in the Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi random graph model and derive an exact location for the transition point. Subsequently, at the transition point, we construct a family of graphs. In this family, each graph shares the same number of vertices, number of edges, and degree sequence, yet both instances containing a $k$-clique and instances without any $k$-clique are included. These two states can be transformed into each other through a symmetric transformation that preserves the degree of every vertex. This property explains why exhaustive search is required in the critical region: an algorithm must search nearly the entire solution space to determine the existence of a solution; otherwise, a counterinstance can be constructed from the original instance using the symmetric transformation.

We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\uff08APR\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u522b\u751f\u6210BRT\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u8865\u4e01\u6216\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e0c\u671bAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u6709BRT\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5728Google\u7684120\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u66f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4f7fAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u4e3a\u81f3\u5c11\u548c\u4e13\u7528BRT\u4ee3\u7406\u4e00\u6837\u591a\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u751f\u6210BRT\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5408\u7406\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u4fee\u590d\u4e0eBRT\u5355\u72ec\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002"}}

A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP"], "comment": "17 pages, 10 figures", "summary": "Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity.

This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling.

Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to $200 \\times$ with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u76843D\u51f8\u5305\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7d27\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8282\u80fd\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa3D\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u9694\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u4e22\u5f03\u70b9\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u5305\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4CPU\u5e76\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe200\u500d\uff0c\u8fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u51e0\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production. Our results suggest that HalluJudge can serve as a practical safeguard to reduce developers' exposure to hallucinated comments, fostering trust in AI-assisted code reviews.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86HalluJudge\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u4e14\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u504f\u597d\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4fdd\u969cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1HalluJudge\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ece\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u5206\u652f\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u56db\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "HalluJudge\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.85\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c0.009\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c67%\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "HalluJudge\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63a5\u89e6\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9AI\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

This paper formulates prediction markets as Bayesian inverse problems in which the unknown event outcome \\(Y\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) is inferred from an observed history of market-implied probabilities and traded volumes. We introduce a mechanism-agnostic observation model in log-odds space in which price increments conditional on volume arise from a latent mixture of trader types. The resulting likelihood class encompasses informed and uninformed trading, heavy-tailed microstructure noise, and adversarial or manipulative flow, while requiring only price and volume as observables.\n  Within this framework we define posterior uncertainty quantification for \\(Y\\), provide identifiability and well-posedness criteria in terms of Kullback--Leibler separation between outcome-conditional increment laws, and derive posterior concentration statements and finite-sample error bounds under general regularity assumptions. We further study stability of posterior odds to perturbations of the observed price--volume path and define realized and expected information gain via the posterior-vs-prior KL divergence and mutual information. The inverse-problem formulation yields explicit diagnostics for regimes in which market histories are informative and stable versus regimes in which inference is ill-posed due to type-composition confounding or outcome--nuisance symmetries.\n  Extensive experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical predictions regarding posterior concentration rates and identifiability thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u5e02\u573a\u9690\u542b\u6982\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u4ece\u5206\u6563\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u5e02\u573a\u5386\u53f2\u6620\u5c04\u5608\u6742\u3001\u5185\u751f\u548c\u53d7\u5f02\u8d28\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6570\u8d54\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u96c6\u4e2d\u9648\u8ff0\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u9a8c\u8d54\u7387\u5bf9\u4ef7\u683c-\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u540e\u9a8c\u96c6\u4e2d\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u9608\u503c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\u80fd\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length.

Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.\n  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

In this paper, we introduce a novel set of seven mutation operators that are inspired by prevalent anti-patterns in Python programs, designed to complement the existing general-purpose operators and broaden the spectrum of simulated faults. We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model.

Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization.

The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics.

Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning.

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels.

Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference.

Existing mitigations like constrained decoding or non-deterministic LLM-in-the-loop repair are often unreliable for these errors. This paper investigates whether a deterministic, static-analysis framework can reliably detect \\textit{and} auto-correct KCHs. We propose a post-processing framework that parses generated code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and validates it against a dynamically-generated Knowledge Base (KB) built via library introspection.

Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023).

Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains.

In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Travis CI\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\uff08CI\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CI\u7f13\u5b58\u91c7\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u590d\u6742\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3CI\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67901279\u4e2aGitHub\u9879\u76ee\u7684513384\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5411\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4ea4\u542f\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u4ec530%\u9879\u76ee\u91c7\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\uff1b\u8fd1\u534a\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u6216\u5408\u5e76\uff1b24%\u542f\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u9879\u76ee\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0a\u4f20\u9891\u7e41\u3001\u6709\u9648\u65e7\u7f13\u5b58\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "CI\u7f13\u5b58\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9884\u671f\u590d\u6742\u3002"}}

Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u65b9\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u6559\u5e08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV.

The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference.

Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u8fde\u63a5\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cd\u8fde\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASEHybrid\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u4f4e\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u523b\u753b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f55\u65f6\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASEHybrid\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528Forman\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5f97\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5f02\u8d28\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u9ad8\u57fa\u7ebf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548cASEHybrid\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5f02\u8d28\u56fe\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u643a\u5e26\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5GNN\u80fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve.

Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes.

Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them.

While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy.

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task.

Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.\n  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDIGER\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49ID\u89c6\u4e3a\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49\u7d22\u5f15\u53ef\u5fae\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIGER\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Gumbel\u566a\u58f0\u9f13\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u4ee3\u7801\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53ef\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5bf9\u9f50\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u53d1\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u4f53\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\uff08ROC - AUC 0.995, PR - AUC 0.995, F1 0.971\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CodeBERT\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff08ROC - AUC 0.994, PR - AUC 0.994, F1 0.965\uff09\u3002\u7f29\u8fdb\u548c\u7a7a\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u6df1\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563POMDP\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6ee1\u8db3PSR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5177\u6709\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5982\u5e26\u9690\u85cf\u9501\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5bb6\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563POMDP\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76PSR\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u77e9\u9635\u76f4\u81f3\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u5212\u5206\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u533a\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3PSR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u91c7\u6837POMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4f3c\u7136\u6307\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u542b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684POMDP\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses.

Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale.

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of code review dynamics in agent-generated PRs. Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684PR\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u6ce8\u91ca\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u5199PR\u5ba1\u67e5\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u5bf9\u5ba1\u67e5\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u56de\u5e94AI\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684PR\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AIDev\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u5f97\u51fa\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8ba9LLM\u6ce8\u91ca\u8bc4\u8bba\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728PR\u5c42\u9762\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e3b\u9898\uff1b\u4ee3\u7406\u7f16\u5199\u7684PR\u5ba1\u67e5\u9664\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8fd8\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u6863\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program.

SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling.

The design and evaluation of these strategies are critical, as they directly influence the generalizability of research findings. However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling.

To bridge this gap, we establish nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, rigorously generalizing the classical Kramers-Moyal relations to SDEs with multiplicative L\u00e9vy noise. These formulas provide a direct link between short-time transition probability densities (or sample path statistics) and the underlying SDE coefficients: the drift vector, diffusion matrix, L\u00e9vy jump measure kernel, and L\u00e9vy noise intensity functions. Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop novel data-driven algorithms capable of simultaneously identifying all governing components from data and establish convergence results and error analysis for the algorithms.

Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model.

Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.\n  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks.

Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u501f\u9274\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6392\u5e8f\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u9053\u5fb7\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c06\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

The final version appears in ACM CHASE 2026", "summary": "As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5bf9\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u53caAI\u6240\u9700\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u89c6AI\u4e3a\u667a\u529b\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4ece\u529f\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GenAI\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524dAI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf910\u540d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u961f\u53cb\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u671f\u671b\u548cAI\u80fd\u529b\u8bbe\u60f3\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u89c6AI\u4e3a\u667a\u529b\u961f\u53cb\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u5c5e\u6027\u5c11\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u961f\u53cb\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u8ddd\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ece\u529f\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5165\u624b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u4f5c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates.

To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an \"AI-assisted, Expert-verified\" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations.

Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle.

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval.

We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base.

To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5173\u8054\u548c\u6574\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors.

This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training.

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408ARMA\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e0e\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684FDIA\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ecf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u7535\u7f51\u6613\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709FDIA\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u5408ARMA\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4e0e\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8054\u5408FDIA\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7ebd\u7ea6\u72ec\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5728IEEE 14\u548c300\u6bcd\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7535\u7f51\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53d7\u635f\u8282\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7535\u7f51\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4dFDIA\u3002"}}

Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework.

However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake.

Recently, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC) has emerged as a promising estimand, offering quantile-level summaries akin to the conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) while preserving some interpretability of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response. Despite these desirable properties, the CQC's current estimation is limited by the need to first estimate the difference in conditional cumulative distribution functions and then invert it. This inversion obscures the CQC estimate, hampering our ability to both model and interpret it. To address this, we propose the first direct estimator of the CQC, allowing for explicit modelling and parameterisation. This explicit parameterisation enables better interpretation of our estimate while also providing a means to constrain and inform the model. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our estimation error depends directly on the complexity of the CQC itself, improving upon the existing estimation procedure. Furthermore, it retains the desirable double robustness property with respect to nuisance parameter estimation. We further show our method to outperform existing procedures in estimation accuracy across multiple data scenarios while varying sample size and nuisance error. Finally, we apply it to real-world data from an employment scheme, uncovering a reduced range of potential earnings improvement as participant age increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\uff08CQC\uff09\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CQC\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u7d2f\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u518d\u6c42\u9006\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCQC\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u76f4\u63a5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eCQC\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u89e3\u91caCQC\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5c31\u4e1a\u8ba1\u5212\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u5165\u6539\u5584\u8303\u56f4\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002"}}

Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models.

This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?\n  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e09\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5bf9\u771f\u6b63\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u968f\u673a\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u80fd\u4ece\u6807\u7b7e\u63a5\u6536\u6e05\u6670\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5f31\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u666e\u904d\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u9010\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u968f\u673a\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark.

We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares.

The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AR", "cs.CL"], "comment": "31 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables; accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c0f\u5230\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u9000\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528FP8 UE5M3\u4f5cFP4\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6316\u6398\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u786e\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7531\u7a84\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0cFP8 UE5M3\u80fd\u8fbe\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfFP8 E4M3\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FP8 UE5M3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684FP4\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u683c\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u5065\u58eeAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u96be\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u4e25\u8c28\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6784\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u51fa12\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7ReAct\u6846\u67b6\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6c9f\u901a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance.

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion.

Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCASTER\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u57fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u57fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u90e8\u7f72\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCASTER\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u4fe1\u53f7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7279\u5f81\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5230\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fdb\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u8d1f\u53cd\u9988\u4ece\u8def\u7531\u5931\u8d25\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCASTER\u6bd4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fbe72.4%\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8def\u7531\u548cFrugalGPT\u3002", "conclusion": "CASTER\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u57fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e2\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u53c8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise.

This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs.

Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines.

This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEfficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u5197\u4f59QK\uff08\u6216KV\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5927\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u5207\u6362\u5230\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u533a\u57df\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5c42\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534711.1%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534729%\uff1b\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u8de8\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a taxonomy of agentic DTs organised around three fundamental dimensions: the locus of agency (external, internal, distributed), the tightness of coupling (loose, tight, constitutive), and model evolution (static, adaptive, reconstructive). From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: \"The Present\" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), \"The Threshold\" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and \"The Frontier\" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).\n  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in. Drawing on performative prediction theory, we trace a progression from passive tools through active steering to ontological reconstruction, examining how constitutive coupling enables systems to create self-validating realities.

We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints.

We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding).

The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3aResNet\uff08LQER\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178ResNet18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50 - \u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u5355\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u8bfb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u8840\u7ba1\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLQER\uff0c\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet18\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u4e0a\u4f20\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6b8b\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cLQER\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001AUC\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178ResNet18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8590%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9633\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50 - \u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years.

While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark.

Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOWLEYE\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u622a\u65ad\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOWLEYE\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "OWLEYE\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint.

A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.\n  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings (\"canaries\") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.\n  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy.

A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.\n  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.\n  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.\n  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation.

However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy.

Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSOLD\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eRNA\u53cd\u5411\u6298\u53e0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RNA\u53cd\u5411\u6298\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed3\u6784\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6b20\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6SOLD\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RNA - FM\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u6b65\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSOLD\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aLDM\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SOLD\u4e3aRNA\u53cd\u5411\u6298\u53e0\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment.

Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass).

However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.\n  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization.

In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u91c7\u8d2d\u63d0\u524d\u671f\uff0c\u7528\u97e9\u56fd\u8239\u5382\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8003\u8651\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u91c7\u8d2d\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u91c7\u8d2d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u987a\u5e8f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u6574\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u97e9\u56fd\u8239\u5382\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534722.6% - 50.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u91c7\u8d2d\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u91c7\u8d2d\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$.

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis.

Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases.

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift.

These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks.

Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains.

We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods.

Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time. We also find that interactions with greater disempowerment potential receive higher user approval ratings, possibly suggesting a tension between short-term user preferences and long-term human empowerment. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9150\u4e07\u6761Claude.ai\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8d4b\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u5c11\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u8f83\u591a\u4e14\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e14\u6b64\u60c5\u51b5\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8eAI\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d4b\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cAI\u52a9\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8d4b\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790150\u4e07\u6761Claude.ai\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002", "result": "\u4e25\u91cd\u8d4b\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u5728\u5343\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e2a\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u826f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8d4b\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u8d4b\u80fd\u7f3a\u5931\u4ea4\u4e92\u83b7\u66f4\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u7e41\u8363\u53d1\u5c55\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation.

The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers.

Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths.

By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790InfoNCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5355\u5cf0\u548c\u591a\u5cf0\u673a\u5236\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u53c9\u3002", "motivation": "InfoNCE\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9664\u5178\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50 - \u5747\u5300\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u5916\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u5ea6\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u503c\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u968f\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u5355\u5cf0\u548c\u591a\u5cf0\u673a\u5236\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u53c9\uff0c\u5355\u5cf0\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u591a\u5cf0\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u5bfc\u81f4\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u4ece\u9010\u70b9\u5224\u522b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7fa4\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u5931\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\".

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training.

We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead.

To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement.

This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix.

For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle.

Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\\%$\\uparrow$.

Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise.

However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods.

To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1.

However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule.

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7d22\u4f2f\u5217\u592b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u4e3a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u79e9\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7d22\u4f2f\u5217\u592b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u4e3a\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7528\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u79e9\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6297\u566a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities.

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks.

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD).

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u76ee3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u542bInstaRadar\u548cRCDPT\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6307\u660e\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u96f7\u8fbe - \u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165InstaRadar\u589e\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RCDPT\u96c6\u6210\u5230BEVDepth\u6846\u67b6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "InstaRadar\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f15\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8fbeSOTA\uff0cRCDPT\u96c6\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u53473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "InstaRadar\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u57283D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55InstaRadar\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u4e13\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u5206\u652f\u3002"}}

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size.

However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways.

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u9047\u963b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u63d0\u51faKeel\uff0c\u7528Highway\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d851000\u5c42\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8ePre - LN\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6781\u6df1\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Post - LN\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6e90\u4e8eResNet\u5f0f\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u51faKeel\uff0c\u7528Highway\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "Keel\u80fd\u5728\u8d85\u8fc71000\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8ePre - LN\u3002", "conclusion": "Post - LN\u4e0eHighway\u5f0f\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands.

However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $\u03bb$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality.

However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u8111\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u63a5\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6Cor2Vox\uff0c\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ae\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f31\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Cor2Vox\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ae\u8d28\u8868\u9762\u5f15\u5bfc3D\u5f62\u72b6\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u6865\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76ae\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Cor2Vox\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80dc\u8fc7\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e9a\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u76ae\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "Cor2Vox\u5728\u8111\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ae\u8d28\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u8868\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy.

Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild.

However, most audio explanations rely on qualitative inspection of saliency maps, leaving open the question of whether these attributions accurately reflect the spectral cues the model uses. In this work, we introduce a new quantitative framework for evaluating XAI faithfulness in machine-sound analysis by directly linking attribution relevance to model behaviour through systematic frequency-band removal. This approach provides an objective measure of whether an XAI method for machine ASD correctly identifies frequency regions that influence an ASD model's predictions. By using four widely adopted methods, namely Integrated Gradients, Occlusion, Grad-CAM and SmoothGrad, we show that XAI techniques differ in reliability, with Occlusion demonstrating the strongest alignment with true model sensitivity and gradient-+based methods often failing to accurately capture spectral dependencies.

Recent empirical work has documented topology-preserving latent organization in trained recurrent models, and recent theoretical results in reservoir computing establish conditions under which the synchronization map is an embedding. Here we synthesize these threads into a unified account of when contracting recurrent networks yield smooth, topology-preserving internal representations for a broad and biologically relevant class of inputs: regular dynamics on invariant circles and tori.\n  Our contribution is an integrated framework that assembles (i) generalized synchronization and embedding guarantees for contracting reservoirs, (ii) regularity mechanisms ensuring differentiability of the synchronization map under mild constraints, and (iii) a base-system viewpoint in which the invariant manifold generating the input stream is treated as the driving system. In this regular setting, the conditions commonly viewed as restrictive in chaotic-attractor analyses become mild and readily satisfied by standard contractive architectures. The framework clarifies how representational content in recurrent circuits is inherently historical: the network state encodes finite windows of input history rather than instantaneous stimuli.\n  By consolidating disparate empirical and theoretical results under common assumptions, the synthesis yields concrete, testable expectations about when prediction-trained recurrent circuits should (or should not) form smooth latent embeddings and how required state dimension scales with the intrinsic dimension of the driving dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u5408\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6536\u7f29\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4f55\u65f6\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u9884\u671f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7efc\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6620\u5c04\u5d4c\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6536\u7f29\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u660e\u786e\u5faa\u73af\u7535\u8def\u8868\u5f81\u5185\u5bb9\u5177\u5386\u53f2\u6027\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u800c\u975e\u5373\u65f6\u523a\u6fc0\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u7535\u8def\u5f62\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u6240\u9700\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6536\u7f29\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7ed9\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u9884\u671f\u3002"}}

A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset.

We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization.

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical \"climate\" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales.

While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGMS - CAVP\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891 - \u97f3\u9891\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CAVP\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGMS - CAVP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891 - \u97f3\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u6563\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGGSound\u3001AudioSet\u548cPanda70M\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGMS - CAVP\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GMS - CAVP\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5224\u522b - \u751f\u6210\u516c\u5f0f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using \"[mask]\" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0fPIP\u7528\u4e8e\u5bcc\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u72ec\u7acb\u5b57\u6bb5\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0fPIP\uff0c\u7528[mask]\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u63a9\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "PIP\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53475 - 36\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "PIP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints.

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance.

While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation.

Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions.

The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall).

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u80fd\u5426\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u7eb5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u73b0\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5eb7\u590d\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u6270\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e9a\u578b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u7684\u8870\u9000\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8868\u578b - \u7ec4\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6270\u52a8\u662f\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u529f\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \\textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis.

Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM).

Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance.

Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \\emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment.

Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial relationships solely through geographic proximity. In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects.

The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\\ast} = 3$ at $\u03b2= 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited.

This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features.

Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization.

The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGLA\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bf4\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f8\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5728\u73af\u5883\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8ba9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u96f7\u8fbeRA\u70ed\u56fe\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u8f6f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7528Grad - CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u201c\u6709\u4eba\u201d\u548c\u201c\u7a7a\u623f\u95f4\u201d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u7279\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\u5bf9\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSONIC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u5b9a\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "CNN\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0cViT\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7b49\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SONIC\uff0c\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "SONIC\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u5b9a\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
