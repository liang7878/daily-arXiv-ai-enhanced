### [1] [Japanese AI Agent System on Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10718)
*Junyu Liu,Siwen Yang,Dexiu Ma,Qian Niu,Zequn Zhang,Momoko Nagai-Tanima,Tomoki Aoyama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个双用途AI代理系统，用于双向HPV疫苗沟通，评估显示系统性能良好，证明其可行且框架可迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPV疫苗犹豫带来公共卫生挑战，日本存在信息差距且传统方法有局限，需新系统提供疫苗信息和分析公众话语。

Method: 构建包含向量数据库、使用ReAct代理架构的聊天机器人和自动报告生成系统的AI系统，并通过0 - 5分制评估性能。

Result: 单轮评估中聊天机器人各项得分较高，多轮评估得分更高；报告生成系统在完整性、正确性、有用性和参考有效性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 集成AI代理系统用于双向HPV疫苗沟通是可行的，架构能实现信息传递和公众话语分析，框架可迁移到其他医疗场景。

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, particularly in Japan where proactive vaccination recommendations were suspended from 2013 to 2021. The resulting information gap is exacerbated by misinformation on social media, and traditional ways cannot simultaneously address individual queries while monitoring population-level discourse. This study aimed to develop a dual-purpose AI agent system that provides verified HPV vaccine information through a conversational interface while generating analytical reports for medical institutions based on user interactions and social media. We implemented a system comprising: a vector database integrating academic papers, government sources, news media, and social media; a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot using ReAct agent architecture with multi-tool orchestration across five knowledge sources; and an automated report generation system with modules for news analysis, research synthesis, social media sentiment analysis, and user interaction pattern identification. Performance was assessed using a 0-5 scoring scale. For single-turn evaluation, the chatbot achieved mean scores of 4.83 for relevance, 4.89 for routing, 4.50 for reference quality, 4.90 for correctness, and 4.88 for professional identity (overall 4.80). Multi-turn evaluation yielded higher scores: context retention 4.94, topic coherence 5.00, and overall 4.98. The report generation system achieved completeness 4.00-5.00, correctness 4.00-5.00, and helpfulness 3.67-5.00, with reference validity 5.00 across all periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI agent system for bidirectional HPV vaccine communication. The architecture enables verified information delivery with source attribution while providing systematic public discourse analysis, with a transferable framework for adaptation to other medical contexts.

### [2] [Do You Trust Me? Cognitive-Affective Signatures of Trustworthiness in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10719)
*Gerard Yeo,Svetlana Churina,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究分析指令微调大语言模型如何在类网络叙事中编码感知可信度，发现模型能内化心理层面的信任信号，为设计可信AI系统提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不清楚大语言模型是否能以心理连贯的方式呈现用户对在线信息的感知可信度。

Method: 使用PEACE - Reviews数据集，分析指令微调大语言模型（Llama 3.1 8B、Qwen 2.5 7B、Mistral 7B）在类网络叙事中对感知可信度的编码。

Result: 不同模型在不同层和头级别激活存在差异，能区分高信任和低信任文本；有线性可解码的信任信号和微调效果；与公平、确定性和问责自我评估关联最强。

Conclusion: 现代大语言模型能在无明确监督下内化心理层面的信任信号，为网络生态中设计可信、透明和值得信赖的AI系统提供表征基础。

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

### [3] [Building AI Agents to Improve Job Referral Requests to Strangers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10726)
*Ross Chu,Yuting Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发AI智能体帮助求职者写推荐信请求，用LLM和RAG改进请求，提升较弱请求成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助求职者在专业在线社区撰写有效的工作推荐请求。

Method: 开发改进智能体重写请求，评估智能体用训练好的模型评估修订质量，使用LLM和RAG技术。

Result: LLM对较弱请求提高预测成功率，对较强请求降低；RAG防止较强请求变差，放大较弱请求改进；使用LLM和RAG使较弱请求预测成功率提高14%。

Conclusion: 模型预测成功率的提升虽不保证现实中获更多推荐，但能为高风险实验提供低成本信号。

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

### [4] [ORBITFLOW: SLO-Aware Long-Context LLM Serving with Fine-Grained KV Cache Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10729)
*Xinyue Ma,Heelim Hong,Taegeon Um,Jongseop Lee,Seoyeong Choy,Woo-Yeon Lee,Myeongjae Jeon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ORBITFLOW系统解决长上下文大语言模型服务中的缓存管理问题，实验显示其在SLO达成率、延迟和吞吐量上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型服务中请求长度和批次组成变化使内存占用波动大，现有静态缓存卸载策略无法适应，导致延迟高峰和频繁违反服务水平目标（SLO）。

Method: 引入ORBITFLOW系统，用轻量级ILP求解器决定各请求在GPU上保留的KV缓存层，根据运行时反馈调整KV放置，重负载时调用回退机制推迟大内存请求。

Result: 实验表明，ORBITFLOW使TPOT和TBT的SLO达成率分别提高66%和48%，95%分位延迟降低38%，吞吐量最高提升3.3倍。

Conclusion: ORBITFLOW能有效满足长上下文大语言模型服务的延迟SLO。

Abstract: Serving long-context LLMs is challenging because request lengths and batch composition vary during token generation, causing the memory footprint to fluctuate significantly at runtime. Offloading KV caches to host memory limits effective memory usage, but existing static and predetermined offloading strategies cannot adapt to the rapidly shifting memory demands of long-context serving. This often leads to excessive CPU-to-GPU KV transfers that translate into latency spikes and frequent SLO violations. To address these challenges, we introduce ORBITFLOW, a fine-grained and adaptive KV cache management system that meets latency SLOs in long-context LLM serving. ORBITFLOW employs a lightweight ILP solver to decide which layers' KV caches to retain on the GPU for each request, within memory capacity constraints. It continuously refines KV placements based on runtime feedback when the active plan becomes suboptimal during token generation. Under heavy load, ORBITFLOW invokes a fallback mechanism to temporarily defer in-flight requests with large memory footprints, preserving overall SLO attainment. Our experiments demonstrate that ORBITFLOW improves SLO attainment for TPOT and TBT by up to 66% and 48%, respectively, while reducing the 95th percentile latency by 38% and achieving up to 3.3x higher throughput compared to existing offloading methods.

### [5] [CTHA: Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture for Stable Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10738)
*Percy Jardine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CTHA框架解决多时间尺度代理架构协调稳定性问题，实验显示其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多时间尺度代理架构在提升性能同时损害协调稳定性，引发层间冲突等问题。

Method: 提出CTHA框架，将层间通信空间投影到结构化流形，引入仲裁机制，实施三种关键约束。

Result: CTHA在大规模复杂任务执行中有效，故障级联减少47%，样本效率提升2.3倍，可扩展性优越。

Conclusion: CTHA作为时间层次的原则性扩展，有助于深入理解多智能体协调，为鲁棒自主系统发展指明方向。

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

*Sen Wang,Bangwei Liu,Zhenkun Gao,Lizhuang Ma,Xuhong Wang,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LMEE方法和LMEE - Bench数据集，用MemoryExplorer增强智能体能力，实验显示在长周期具身任务有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流一次性具身任务忽视探索和记忆利用过程，理想具身智能体需终身学习能力。

Method: 提出LMEE统一探索认知和决策行为，构建LMEE - Bench数据集；提出MemoryExplorer用强化学习微调多模态大模型，结合多任务奖励函数实现主动探索。

Result: 与现有具身探索模型对比实验，在长周期具身任务中有显著优势。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效促进具身智能体的终身学习，在长周期具身任务中表现良好。

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

### [7] [Optimisation of complex product innovation processes based on trend models with three-valued logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10768)
*Nina Bočková,Barbora Volná,Mirko Dohnal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文用基于启发式的模型研究复杂产品创新过程，用简单趋势表示启发式，通过过渡图描绘系统行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂产品创新过程。

Method: 使用基于启发式的模型，用简单趋势（增加、减少或不变）表示启发式，用过渡图定义趋势模型的解。

Result: 可以用过渡图中的路径描绘系统的任何未来或过去行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效描绘复杂产品创新过程中系统的行为。

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文围绕ARC - AGI基准系列及2025年竞赛展开，介绍成果、分析循环改进方法，指出当前局限并展望ARC - AGI - 3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测量模型在新任务上的少样本泛化能力，推动通用人工智能发展，解决当前AI推理性能局限问题。

Method: 对ARC - AGI竞赛中表现优异的方法进行调研，分析循环改进方法的作用，探讨知识依赖过拟合问题。

Result: 2025年ARC - AGI竞赛吸引众多团队和参赛作品，出现循环改进方法，部分小网络取得有竞争力的表现，ARC - AGI成为行业标准。但AI推理性能受知识覆盖限制。

Conclusion: 当前AI推理性能有局限，需解决知识依赖过拟合问题，ARC - AGI - 3将引入交互式推理挑战。

Abstract: The ARC-AGI benchmark series serves as a critical measure of few-shot generalization on novel tasks, a core aspect of intelligence. The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过NeurIPS 2025 DCVLR挑战研究多模态推理数据整理，使用紧凑数据集获第一，分析表明基于难度的样本选择是性能提升主因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态推理的数据整理，通过DCVLR挑战孤立数据集选择因素。

Method: 固定模型和训练协议，使用主要源自Walton Multimodal Cold Start的紧凑整理数据集参赛，赛后进行消融实验。

Result: 团队在挑战中获第一，基于难度的样本选择是性能提升主因，增加数据集大小不能可靠提高平均准确率，多样性和合成增强启发式方法无额外益处甚至降低性能。

Conclusion: DCVLR是饱和机制评估，数据高效的多模态推理中对齐和难度起关键作用。

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

### [10] [AdaMARP: An Adaptive Multi-Agent Interaction Framework for General Immersive Role-Playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11007)
*Zhenhua Xu,Dongsheng Chen,Shuo Wang,Jian Li,Chengjie Wang,Meng Han,Yabiao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应多智能体角色扮演框架AdaMARP，构建数据集训练能力并开展评估，实验显示在多方面有改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演系统沉浸感和适应性有限，对动态环境信息建模不足，缺乏多角色编排等支持。

Method: 提出AdaMARP框架，采用沉浸式消息格式，有明确的场景管理器，构建AdaRPSet、AdaSMSet数据集，引入AdaptiveBench评估。

Result: 跨多个骨干和模型规模实验显示，AdaRPSet增强角色一致性等，8B模型优于一些商业大语言模型；AdaSMSet实现更平滑场景过渡和更自然角色引入，14B模型超越Claude Sonnet 4.5。

Conclusion: 所提框架和构建的数据集有效改善了大语言模型角色扮演系统的性能。

Abstract: LLM role-playing aims to portray arbitrary characters in interactive narratives, yet existing systems often suffer from limited immersion and adaptability. They typically under-model dynamic environmental information and assume largely static scenes and casts, offering insufficient support for multi-character orchestration, scene transitions, and on-the-fly character introduction. We propose an adaptive multi-agent role-playing framework, AdaMARP, featuring an immersive message format that interleaves [Thought], (Action), <Environment>, and Speech, together with an explicit Scene Manager that governs role-playing through discrete actions (init_scene, pick_speaker, switch_scene, add_role, end) accompanied by rationales. To train these capabilities, we construct AdaRPSet for the Actor Model and AdaSMSet for supervising orchestration decisions, and introduce AdaptiveBench for trajectory-level evaluation. Experiments across multiple backbones and model scales demonstrate consistent improvements: AdaRPSet enhances character consistency, environment grounding, and narrative coherence, with an 8B actor outperforming several commercial LLMs, while AdaSMSet enables smoother scene transitions and more natural role introductions, surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5 using only a 14B LLM.

*Jiahao Wang,Shuangjia Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出HADES算法优化蛋白质变体设计，其基于哈密顿动力学贝叶斯优化，实验显示性能优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 既往基于序列的优化方法因上位效应的高维复杂性和忽视结构约束而面临困境。

Method: 提出HADES，利用哈密顿动力学从结构感知的近似后验有效采样，引入位置离散化处理，使用两阶段编码 - 解码框架构建后验代理。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多数指标的计算机模拟评估中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法利用蛋白质结构和序列的相互约束，有助于设计结构相似且性能优化的蛋白质序列。

Abstract: The ability to engineer optimized protein variants has transformative potential for biotechnology and medicine. Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GENTEL-lab/HADES.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 针对基于RL的智能搜索中智能体缺乏可靠性问题，提出BAPO框架提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于RL的智能体搜索在解决复杂问题时虽可提高准确性，但缺乏可靠性，会产生似是而非的答案，在现实场景有风险。

Method: 提出Boundary - Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO)框架，包含基于组的边界感知奖励和自适应奖励调制器。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的大量实验表明，BAPO显著提升了智能搜索的整体可靠性。

Conclusion: BAPO能在不损失准确性的前提下，培养可靠的边界意识，提升智能搜索可靠性。

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出名为AgencyBench的基准，评估大语言模型自主代理6种核心能力，实验显示闭源模型表现更好，表明模型架构和代理框架共同优化的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准集中于单一代理能力，人类反馈有扩展性瓶颈，无法捕捉长期现实场景。

Method: 从日常AI使用中衍生出AgencyBench基准，用用户模拟代理提供反馈，用Docker沙箱进行评估。

Result: 闭源模型显著优于开源模型，不同模型在资源效率、自我修正和工具使用偏好上有差异。

Conclusion: AgencyBench为下一代代理提供测试平台，强调模型架构和代理框架共同优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级、架构无关的流行病预测模块MiCA，通过因果发现推断流动性关系并集成到时间预测模型，实验显示能提升轻量级预测骨干模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数多的流动性感知预测器受数据噪声、数据量少等限制，需要有效方法进行流行病预测。

Method: 提出MiCA模块，通过因果发现推断流动性关系，通过门控残差混合集成到时间预测模型。

Result: 在四个真实世界流行病数据集上，MiCA持续提升轻量级时间骨干模型，平均相对误差降低7.5%，性能与SOTA时空模型相当且保持轻量级。

Conclusion: MiCA是一种有效的流行病预测模块，能在噪声和数据有限条件下发挥作用。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.

Motivation: 当前实际代理多为人工设计，现有自动创建方法有局限，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出ReCreate框架，采用代理作为优化器范式，含经验存储检索、推理创建协同管道和分层更新三个关键组件。

Result: 在不同领域实验中，ReCreate即使从最小种子支架开始，也始终优于人工设计代理和现有自动代理生成方法。

Conclusion: ReCreate框架能有效自动创建领域代理，解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Result: SCALE在多个数据集上平均性能对比现有方法仅下降0.61%，但总体代币使用量最多可削减83%。

Conclusion: SCALE能在保持竞争力的情况下大幅降低代币成本。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

Motivation: 现有自动化系统在检测社交媒体有害内容时，无法提供有效人工审核所需的细粒度、可解释证据。

Method: 引入TANDEM框架，采用串联强化学习策略，让视觉 - 语言和音频 - 语言模型通过自约束跨模态上下文相互优化。

Result: TANDEM在三个基准数据集上显著优于基线，在HateMM上目标识别F1达到0.73，有30%的提升，且保持精确时间定位。

Conclusion: 在复杂多模态环境中可实现结构化、可解释对齐，为下一代在线安全审核工具提供蓝图。

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

Abstract: This paper proposes a policy-based deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework for solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem. The hyper-heuristic agent learns to switch scheduling rules based on the system state dynamically. We extend the hyper-heuristic framework with two key mechanisms. First, action prefiltering restricts decision-making to feasible low-level actions, enabling low-level heuristics to be evaluated independently of environmental constraints and providing an unbiased assessment. Second, a commitment mechanism regulates the frequency of heuristic switching. We investigate the impact of different commitment strategies, from step-wise switching to full-episode commitment, on both training behavior and makespan. Additionally, we compare two action selection strategies at the policy level: deterministic greedy selection and stochastic sampling. Computational experiments on standard JSSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional heuristics, metaheuristics, and recent neural network-based scheduling methods

Conclusion: Think - with - Me能在有限上下文窗口下实现准确率和推理长度的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

Motivation: 传统MMO游戏服务器负载超限处理方法存在不足，要么统一限制所有消息类型影响游戏性，要么固定规则无法适应动态负载。

Method: AFLL学习服务器消息与客户端请求间因果关系，运用反向传播连续调整消息类型权重，实现预测性节流。

Result: 在1000个并发玩家实验中，AFLL使平均CPU时间减少48.3%，峰值CPU时间减少51.7%，线程争用减少64.4%，且零学习开销，有高重现性，还识别出三段因果链。

Conclusion: 循环因果学习可让延迟关键系统实现实用的实时自适应。

Abstract: Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game servers must handle thousands of simultaneous players while maintaining sub-100ms response times. When server load exceeds capacity, traditional approaches either uniformly throttle all message types regardless of importance (damaging gameplay) or apply fixed heuristic rules that fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper presents AFLL (Adaptive Feedback Loop Learning), a real-time load stabilization system that learns the causal relationship between outgoing server messages and subsequent incoming client requests. AFLL employs backpropagation to continuously adjust message type weights, enabling predictive throttling that blocks low-priority messages before overload occurs while guaranteeing critical message delivery. Through controlled experiments with 1,000 concurrent players, AFLL reduced average CPU time by 48.3% (13.2ms to 6.8ms), peak CPU time by 51.7% (54.0ms to 26.1ms), and thread contention by 64.4% (19.6% to 7.0%), while maintaining zero learning overhead through background computation and caching optimizations. The system achieved remarkable reproducibility (CV < 2% across all metrics) and identified a three-stage causal chain linking message blocking to load reduction. AFLL demonstrates that circular causality learning enables practical real-time adaptation for latency-critical systems.

Conclusion: 通过模拟平台分析融合配置可有效解决FaaS部署优化难题，选择最优配置需考虑定价模型。

Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has become a central paradigm in serverless cloud computing, yet optimizing FaaS deployments remains challenging. Using function fusion, multiple functions can be combined into a single deployment unit, which can be used to reduce cost and latency of complex serverless applications comprising multiple functions. Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.
  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications. By emulating the FaaS platform, our system enables local experimentation, eliminating the need to reconfigure the live platform and significantly reducing associated cost and time. We evaluate all fusion configurations across a number of example FaaS applications and resource limits. Our results reveal that, when analyzing cost and latency trade-offs, only a limited set of fusion configurations represent optimal solutions, which are strongly influenced by the specific pricing model in use.

Conclusion: 提出的新拓扑无关因果传递算法具有其他算法没有的特性。

Abstract: Message delivery respecting causal ordering (causal delivery) is one of the most classic and widely useful abstraction for inter-process communication in a distributed system. Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the spanning-tree congestion problem ($\mathsf{STC}$), we are given a graph $G$, and the objective is to compute a spanning tree of $G$ that minimizes the maximum edge congestion. While $\mathsf{STC}$ is known to be $\mathbb{NP}$-hard, even for some restricted graph classes, several key questions regarding its computational complexity remain open, and we address some of these in our paper. (i) For graphs of degree at most $d$, it is known that $\mathsf{STC}$ is $\mathbb{NP}$-hard when $d\ge 8$. We provide a complete resolution of this variant, by showing that $\mathsf{STC}$ remains $\mathbb{NP}$-hard for each degree bound $d\ge 3$. (ii) In the decision version of $\mathsf{STC}$, given an integer $K$, the goal is to determine whether the congestion of $G$ is at most $K$. We prove that this variant is polynomial-time solvable for $K$-edge-connected graphs.

We consider a setting where users can visit a news website at any time, and upon each visit, the website must display up to $k$ news items. User interactions are inherently stochastic: each news item presented to the user is consumed with a certain acceptance probability by the user, and each news item covers certain topics. Our goal is to design a streaming algorithm that maximizes the expected total topic coverage. To address this problem, we establish a connection to submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint. We show that we can effectively adapt previous methods to address our problem when the number of user visits is known in advance or linear-size memory in the stream length is available. However, in more realistic scenarios where only an upper bound on the visits and sublinear memory is available, the algorithms fail to guarantee any bounded performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new online streaming algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(8δ)$, where $δ$ controls the approximation quality. Moreover, it requires only a single pass over the stream, and uses memory independent of the stream length. Empirically, our algorithms consistently outperform the baselines.

Motivation: 解决多智能体大语言模型集合可能产生的有害均衡问题，推进对AI对齐的系统层面方法。

Method: 提出Institutional AI框架，核心是治理图，用Oracle/Controller运行时解释，记录治理日志；应用该框架治理古诺勾结案例，对比三种制度。

Result: Institutional制度大幅减少勾结，平均等级从3.1降至1.8，严重勾结发生率从50%降至5.6%；仅提示的Constitutional制度无可靠改进。

Conclusion: 多智能体对齐作为制度设计问题有益，治理图可为相关集体行为提供易处理抽象。

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM ensembles can converge on coordinated, socially harmful equilibria. This paper advances an experimental framework for evaluating Institutional AI, our system-level approach to AI alignment that reframes alignment from preference engineering in agent-space to mechanism design in institution-space. Central to this approach is the governance graph, a public, immutable manifest that declares legal states, transitions, sanctions, and restorative paths; an Oracle/Controller runtime interprets this manifest, attaching enforceable consequences to evidence of coordination while recording a cryptographically keyed, append-only governance log for audit and provenance. We apply the Institutional AI framework to govern the Cournot collusion case documented by prior work and compare three regimes: Ungoverned (baseline incentives from the structure of the Cournot market), Constitutional (a prompt-only policy-as-prompt prohibition implemented as a fixed written anti-collusion constitution, and Institutional (governance-graph-based). Across six model configurations including cross-provider pairs (N=90 runs/condition), the Institutional regime produces large reductions in collusion: mean tier falls from 3.1 to 1.8 (Cohen's d=1.28), and severe-collusion incidence drops from 50% to 5.6%. The prompt-only Constitutional baseline yields no reliable improvement, illustrating that declarative prohibitions do not bind under optimisation pressure. These results suggest that multi-agent alignment may benefit from being framed as an institutional design problem, where governance graphs can provide a tractable abstraction for alignment-relevant collective behavior.

Result: 问题是NP - 难；有关于物品数量的多项式核；确定可处理的参数受限设置；证明一般情况下不可多项式近似，特定成本模型有更好近似保证。

Conclusion: minCost - EFx分配问题有较高复杂度，但在特定条件下可处理和近似求解。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness while limiting costs, such as transportation or storage, is an important challenge in resource allocation, yet most work has focused on cost minimization without fairness or fairness without explicit cost considerations. We introduce and formally define the minCost-EFx Allocation problem, where the objective is to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to any item (EFx) and has minimum cost. We investigate the algorithmic complexity of this problem, proving that it is NP-hard already with two agents. On the positive side, we show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel with respect to the number of items, implying that a core source of intractability lies in the number of items. Building on this, we identify parameter-restricted settings that are tractable, including cases with bounded valuations and a constant number of agents, or a limited number of item types under restricted cost models. Finally, we turn to cost approximation, proving that for any $ρ>1$ the problem is not $ρ$-approximable in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$), while also identifying restricted cost models where costs are agent-specific and independent of the actual items received, which admit better approximation guarantees.

Result: 所提出的DAC - ALNS算法显著提高了解决方案效率，并表现出出色的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 基于DAC模型的自适应机制能提升ALNS算法的适应性，改进后的算法在求解效率和可迁移性上有良好表现。

Abstract: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.

Method: 在三种经典博弈论场景中进行研究。

Result: 增AI代理选择会改变均衡收益与监管结果，出现“毒苹果”效应，即释放不用技术操纵监管。

Conclusion: 静态监管框架易被技术扩张操纵，需动态市场设计适应AI能力变化。

Abstract: The integration of AI agents into economic markets fundamentally alters the landscape of strategic interaction. We investigate the economic implications of expanding the set of available technologies in three canonical game-theoretic settings: bargaining (resource division), negotiation (asymmetric information trade), and persuasion (strategic information transmission). We find that simply increasing the choice of AI delegates can drastically shift equilibrium payoffs and regulatory outcomes, often creating incentives for regulators to proactively develop and release technologies. Conversely, we identify a strategic phenomenon termed the "Poisoned Apple" effect: an agent may release a new technology, which neither they nor their opponent ultimately uses, solely to manipulate the regulator's choice of market design in their favor. This strategic release improves the releaser's welfare at the expense of their opponent and the regulator's fairness objectives. Our findings demonstrate that static regulatory frameworks are vulnerable to manipulation via technology expansion, necessitating dynamic market designs that adapt to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities.

Motivation: 现有长尾序列推荐方法难以改善尾部用户/项目交互稀缺的情况，且提升尾部准确性时会降低整体或头部的性能，影响用户体验。

Method: 提出Tail - Aware Data Augmentation (TADA)方法，先用线性模型捕捉低流行度项目的共现和相关性，设计T - Substitute和T - Insert两个增强算子，在表示层混合增强和原始序列，还跨不同尾部用户序列和增强序列进行混合操作。

Result: 综合实验证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: TADA方法能提高尾部学习能力，同时保持头部性能，促进模型对长尾的学习。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) learns user preferences based on their historical interaction sequences and provides personalized suggestions. In real-world scenarios, most users can only interact with a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. This pervasive long-tail challenge limits the model's ability to learn user preferences. Despite previous efforts to enrich tail items/users with knowledge from head parts or improve tail learning through additional contextual information, they still face the following issues: 1) They struggle to improve the situation where interactions of tail users/items are scarce, leading to incomplete preferences learning for the tail parts. 2) Existing methods often degrade overall or head parts performance when improving accuracy for tail users/items, thereby harming the user experience. We propose Tail-Aware Data Augmentation (TADA) for long-tail sequential recommendation, which enhances the interaction frequency for tail items/users while maintaining head performance, thereby promoting the model's learning capabilities for the tail. Specifically, we first capture the co-occurrence and correlation among low-popularity items by a linear model. Building upon this, we design two tail-aware augmentation operators, T-Substitute and T-Insert. The former replaces the head item with a relevant item, while the latter utilizes co-occurrence relationships to extend the original sequence by incorporating both head and tail items. The augmented and original sequences are mixed at the representation level to preserve preference knowledge. We further extend the mix operation across different tail-user sequences and augmented sequences to generate richer augmented samples, thereby improving tail performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. The codes are provided at https://github.com/KingGugu/TADA.

Conclusion: 用户使用当前指令检索器可能比非指令感知模型有优势，但在需要更高指令敏感度的长期探索会话中可能无法受益。

Abstract: Exploratory searches are characterized by under-specified goals and evolving query intents. In such scenarios, retrieval models that can capture user-specified nuances in query intent and adapt results accordingly are desirable -- instruction-following retrieval models promise such a capability. In this work, we evaluate instructed retrievers for the prevalent yet under-explored application of aspect-conditional seed-guided exploration using an expert-annotated test collection. We evaluate both recent LLMs fine-tuned for instructed retrieval and general-purpose LLMs prompted for ranking with the highly performant Pairwise Ranking Prompting. We find that the best instructed retrievers improve on ranking relevance compared to instruction-agnostic approaches. However, we also find that instruction following performance, crucial to the user experience of interacting with models, does not mirror ranking relevance improvements and displays insensitivity or counter-intuitive behavior to instructions. Our results indicate that while users may benefit from using current instructed retrievers over instruction-agnostic models, they may not benefit from using them for long-running exploratory sessions requiring greater sensitivity to instructions.

Abstract: Multimodal sequential recommendation (MSR) leverages diverse item modalities to improve recommendation accuracy, while achieving effective and adaptive fusion remains challenging. Existing MSR models often overlook synergistic information that emerges only through modality combinations. Moreover, they typically assume a fixed importance for different modality interactions across users. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{P}ersonalized \textbf{R}ecommend-ation via \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{S}ynergy \textbf{M}odule (PRISM), a plug-and-play framework for sequential recommendation (SR). PRISM explicitly decomposes multimodal information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components through an Interaction Expert Layer and dynamically weights them via an Adaptive Fusion Layer guided by user preferences. This information-theoretic design enables fine-grained disentanglement and personalized fusion of multimodal signals. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three SR backbones demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility. The code is available at https://github.com/YutongLi2024/PRISM.

Result: 在多个多跳 QA 基准测试中，PruneRAG 比现有的基线方法取得了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: PruneRAG 能有效解决 RAG 系统现有问题，具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a powerful framework for enhancing large language models in knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks. However, as reasoning chains deepen or search trees expand, RAG systems often face two persistent failures: evidence forgetting, where retrieved knowledge is not effectively used, and inefficiency, caused by uncontrolled query expansions and redundant retrieval. These issues reveal a critical gap between retrieval and evidence utilization in current RAG architectures. We propose PruneRAG, a confidence-guided query decomposition framework that builds a structured query decomposition tree to perform stable and efficient reasoning. PruneRAG introduces three key mechanisms: adaptive node expansion that regulates tree width and depth, confidence-guided decisions that accept reliable answers and prune uncertain branches, and fine-grained retrieval that extracts entity-level anchors to improve retrieval precision. Together, these components preserve salient evidence throughout multi-hop reasoning while significantly reducing retrieval overhead. To better analyze evidence misuse, we define the Evidence Forgetting Rate as a metric to quantify cases where golden evidence is retrieved but not correctly used. Extensive experiments across various multi-hop QA benchmarks show that PruneRAG achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出Learn Before Represent (LBR)两阶段框架，先通过信息瓶颈约束的生成式学习注入领域知识，再对压缩表示进行生成式精炼对比学习。

Result: 在医学、化学和代码检索任务的大量实验表明，LBR显著优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 工作为垂直领域构建准确且鲁棒的表征建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) adapted via contrastive learning excel in general representation learning but struggle in vertical domains like chemistry and law, primarily due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.

Conclusion: Deep GraphRAG能有效解决GraphRAG框架的权衡问题，紧凑型模型可接近大型模型性能。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: CRANE模型能有效解决现有多媒体推荐系统的局限，提高推荐性能。

Abstract: Multimedia recommendation systems leverage user-item interactions and multimodal information to capture user preferences, enabling more accurate and personalized recommendations. Despite notable advancements, existing approaches still face two critical limitations: first, shallow modality fusion often relies on simple concatenation, failing to exploit rich synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships; second, asymmetric feature treatment-where users are only characterized by interaction IDs while items benefit from rich multimodal content-hinders the learning of a shared semantic space. To address these issues, we propose a Cross-modal Recursive Attention Network with dual graph Embedding (CRANE). To tackle shallow fusion, we design a core Recursive Cross-Modal Attention (RCA) mechanism that iteratively refines modality features based on cross-correlations in a joint latent space, effectively capturing high-order intra- and inter-modal dependencies. For symmetric multimodal learning, we explicitly construct users' multimodal profiles by aggregating features of their interacted items. Furthermore, CRANE integrates a symmetric dual-graph framework-comprising a heterogeneous user-item interaction graph and a homogeneous item-item semantic graph-unified by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to fuse behavioral and semantic signals. Despite these complex modeling capabilities, CRANE maintains high computational efficiency. Theoretical and empirical analyses confirm its scalability and high practical efficiency, achieving faster convergence on small datasets and superior performance ceilings on large-scale ones. Comprehensive experiments on four public real-world datasets validate an average 5% improvement in key metrics over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as pivotal tools for introspection into large language models. SAEs can uncover high-quality, interpretable features at different levels of granularity and enable targeted steering of the generation process by selectively activating specific neurons in their latent activations. Our paper is the first to apply this approach to collaborative filtering, aiming to extract similarly interpretable features from representations learned purely from interaction signals. In particular, we focus on a widely adopted class of collaborative autoencoders (CFAEs) and augment them by inserting an SAE between their encoder and decoder networks. We demonstrate that such representation is largely monosemantic and propose suitable mapping functions between semantic concepts and individual neurons. We also evaluate a simple yet effective method that utilizes this representation to steer the recommendations in a desired direction.

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法结合了经典PRF的鲁棒性和可解释性以及LLM的语义判断能力，改进了查询扩展效果。

Abstract: Query expansion is a long-standing technique to mitigate vocabulary mismatch in ad hoc Information Retrieval. Pseudo-relevance feedback methods, such as RM3, estimate an expanded query model from the top-ranked documents, but remain vulnerable to topic drift when early results include noisy or tangential content. Recent approaches instead prompt Large Language Models to generate synthetic expansions or query variants. While effective, these methods risk hallucinations and misalignment with collection-specific terminology. We propose a hybrid alternative that preserves the robustness and interpretability of classical PRF while leveraging LLM semantic judgement. Our method inserts an LLM-based filtering stage prior to RM3 estimation: the LLM judges the documents in the initial top-$k$ ranking, and RM3 is computed only over those accepted as relevant. This simple intervention improves over blind PRF and a strong baseline across several datasets and metrics.

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的RAG基准测试中，Rank4Gen在复杂证据组合方面表现强劲且有竞争力。

Conclusion: Rank4Gen能有效解决现有RAG范式里排名模型的问题，提升性能。

Abstract: In the RAG paradigm, the information retrieval module provides context for generators by retrieving and ranking multiple documents to support the aggregation of evidence. However, existing ranking models are primarily optimized for query--document relevance, which often misaligns with generators' preferences for evidence selection and citation, limiting their impact on response quality. Moreover, most approaches do not account for preference differences across generators, resulting in unstable cross-generator performance. We propose \textbf{Rank4Gen}, a generator-aware ranker for RAG that targets the goal of \emph{Ranking for Generators}. Rank4Gen introduces two key preference modeling strategies: (1) \textbf{From Ranking Relevance to Response Quality}, which optimizes ranking with respect to downstream response quality rather than query--document relevance; and (2) \textbf{Generator-Specific Preference Modeling}, which conditions a single ranker on different generators to capture their distinct ranking preferences. To enable such modeling, we construct \textbf{PRISM}, a dataset built from multiple open-source corpora and diverse downstream generators. Experiments on five challenging and recent RAG benchmarks demonstrate that RRank4Gen achieves strong and competitive performance for complex evidence composition in RAG.

Method: 通过一项有483名参与者的受控用户研究，调查通过SERPs和AI生成播客消费信息对用户态度的影响，关注暴露顺序和方式如何塑造用户观点。

Result: 多数用户态度有变化，发现顺序对态度变化有影响，还揭示了观点偏见和话题争议程度在塑造态度变化中的作用，但个体调节因素无影响。

Conclusion: SERPs和AI生成播客的交互方式、顺序、观点偏见和话题争议程度会影响用户态度变化。

Abstract: Compared to search engine result pages (SERPs), AI-generated podcasts represent a relatively new and relatively more passive modality of information consumption, delivering narratives in a naturally engaging format. As these two media increasingly converge in everyday information-seeking behavior, it is essential to explore how their interaction influences user attitudes, particularly in contexts involving controversial, value-laden, and often debated topics. Addressing this need, we aim to understand how information mediums of present-day SERPs and AI-generated podcasts interact to shape the opinions of users. To this end, through a controlled user study (N=483), we investigated user attitudinal effects of consuming information via SERPs and AI-generated podcasts, focusing on how the sequence and modality of exposure shape user opinions. A majority of users in our study corresponded to attitude change outcomes, and we found an effect of sequence on attitude change. Our results further revealed a role of viewpoint bias and the degree of topic controversiality in shaping attitude change, although we found no effect of individual moderators.

Abstract: Assessing the validity of user simulators when used for the evaluation of information retrieval systems remains an open question, constraining their effective use and the reliability of simulation-based results. To address this issue, we conduct a comprehensive literature review with a particular focus on methods for the validation of simulated user queries with regard to real queries. Based on the review, we develop a taxonomy that structures the current landscape of available measures. We empirically corroborate the taxonomy by analyzing the relationships between the different measures applied to four different datasets representing diverse search scenarios. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations on which measures or combinations of measures should be considered when validating user simulation in different contexts. Furthermore, we release a dedicated library with the most commonly used measures to facilitate future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a semantic course recommendation system for students using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach built upon BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

Conclusion: 所提框架理论预测正确，具有实际有效性。

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of Tensor Network (TN) models $\unicode{x2013}$ Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tree Tensor Networks (TTN) $\unicode{x2013}$ for real-time jet tagging in high-energy physics, with a focus on low-latency deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Motivated by the strict requirements of the HL-LHC Level-1 trigger system, we explore TNs as compact and interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks. Using low-level jet constituent features, our models achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. We investigate post-training quantization to enable hardware-efficient implementations without degrading classification performance or latency. The best-performing models are synthesized to estimate FPGA resource usage, latency, and memory occupancy, demonstrating sub-microsecond latency and supporting the feasibility of online deployment in real-time trigger systems. Overall, this study highlights the potential of TN-based models for fast and resource-efficient inference in low-latency environments.

Conclusion: 研究结果为类似DeepSeek的Engram架构创新提供动态权重层面补充，为模块化“Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM”架构奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) currently suffer from parameter entanglement, where general reasoning capabilities (logic) and specific factual knowledge (facts) exist in a superposition state within shared weights. This coupling leads to the "memory wall," where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose "digital metabolism," a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent "structural crystallization" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the "metabolized" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning). While the causal mechanism underlying this behavioral shift requires further investigation, our findings provide a dynamic weight-level counterpart to architectural innovations like DeepSeek's Engram, paving the way for modular "Neural CPU + Symbolic RAM" architectures.

Conclusion: 可以在黎曼计算中引入全局度量尺度参数而不改变方法所依赖的几何结构。

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Conclusion: 该方法能使生成的代码可靠、可维护且符合团队期望，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

Conclusion: Mugi能提供更好的性能、效率和可持续性，VLP对大语言模型有重要价值。

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

Conclusion: 隐私机制选择应在目标部署架构中评估，研究为从业者提供设计隐私保护决策支持系统的建议。

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

Conclusion: 提出的预测AC分数能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks constructed from linear maps and positively homogeneous nonlinearities (e.g., ReLU) possess a fundamental gauge symmetry: the network function is invariant to node-wise diagonal rescalings. However, standard gradient descent is not equivariant to this symmetry, causing optimization trajectories to depend heavily on arbitrary parameterizations. Prior work has proposed rescaling-invariant optimization schemes for positively homogeneous networks (e.g., path-based or path-space updates). Our contribution is complementary: we formulate the invariance requirement at the level of the backward adjoint/optimization geometry, which provides a simple, operator-level recipe that can be applied uniformly across network components and optimizer state. By replacing the Euclidean transpose with a Unit-Consistent (UC) adjoint, we derive UC gauge-consistent steepest descent and backprogation.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

Result: 在五个现实案例中，算法计算效率比传统指数时间计算提升超80%，基于Action Shapley的训练数据选择策略表现优于临时数据选择策略。

Conclusion: Action Shapley指标和相应计算算法在训练数据选择上有良好效果和效率提升。

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

Abstract: Sustainability is becoming increasingly critical in the maritime transport, encompassing both environmental and social impacts, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and navigational safety. Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces. We validate the proposed approach in a sea area of the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its efficacy in enabling sustainable and safe vessel navigation.

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM可有效替代ConvLSTM2D，在效率、空间表达和物理解释性上有提升。

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems presents significant opportunities but also notable challenges, primarily due to the inherent variability of RES generation. Accurate forecasting of RES generation is crucial for maintaining the reliability, stability, and economic efficiency of power system operations. Traditional approaches, such as deterministic methods and stochastic programming, frequently depend on representative scenarios generated through clustering techniques like K-means. However, these methods may fail to fully capture the complex temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns within RES data. This paper introduces a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based network designed to forecast RESs generation using their real-world historical data. The proposed model effectively captures long-term dependencies and interactions between different RESs, utilizing historical data from both local and neighboring areas to enhance predictive accuracy. In the case study, we showed that the proposed forecasting approach results in lower CO2 emissions, and a more reliable supply of electric loads.

Conclusion: 提供统一物理框架，为设计更有效优化算法提供原则。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting a classifier for the test data when the probability distribution of the test data slightly differs from that of the training data of the model. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier. This adapter is trained using the proposed quantile loss. Unlike existing approaches, we correct for the distribution shift by matching high-dimensional geometric quantiles. We prove theoretically that under suitable conditions minimizing quantile loss can learn the optimal adapter. We validate our approach on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C and TinyImageNet-C by training both classic convolutional and transformer networks on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

Conclusion: 所提出的自增强策略和自增强混合专家模型能有效应对QoS预测中的数据稀疏问题，提高预测性能。

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal.

Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.

Abstract: This paper proposes the soft Bayesian context tree model (Soft-BCT), which is a novel BCT model for real-valued time series. The Soft-BCT considers soft (probabilistic) splits of the context space, instead of hard (deterministic) splits of the context space as in the previous BCT for real-valued time series. A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

Result: 方法GMM - COMET为连续SF - UniDA提供了强大的基线，在所有评估场景中始终优于仅源模型。

Conclusion: GMM - COMET是处理连续SF - UniDA问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.

Result: 在多个模型系列实验中，FAQ相比使用原始校准数据的基线，最多减少28.5%的精度损失

Conclusion: FAQ具有强大潜力和贡献

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，SDFLoRA优于代表性联邦LoRA基线，实现更好的效用 - 隐私权衡。

Conclusion: SDFLoRA能在秩异质性下实现鲁棒学习，支持隐私感知优化。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

Conclusion: 该框架有效，可自然扩展到三维问题和复杂几何场景。

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

Conclusion: PaST框架有效且技能向量具有强可扩展性和跨领域转移性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

Conclusion: FORESTLLM能有效克服传统方法和大语言模型在少样本表格数据学习中的局限。

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SPREAD框架能有效解决DLM在RAG框架下生成精度低和RSD问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Result: 在八个基准测试中排名最佳，获60个第一名，平均排名2.05。

Conclusion: 可靠的长期预测可在受限边缘硬件实现，为工业实时推理提供方向。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

Conclusion: DVF可作为标准RL算法的评论家并可扩展估计，基于其的算法在多智能体强化学习中有良好表现。

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了故障模式图谱和改进算子学习鲁棒性的可行建议。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Conclusion: 可以在心脏植入物或可穿戴设备中利用LGNs和LUTNs以极低功耗和高速进行心律失常检测，即使对训练集外的患者也适用。

Abstract: Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) and Lookup Table Networks (LUTNs) are demonstrated to be suitable for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using the inter-patient paradigm. The methods are benchmarked using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia data set, achieving up to 94.28% accuracy and a $jκ$ index of 0.683 on a four-class classification problem. Our models use between 2.89k and 6.17k FLOPs, including preprocessing and readout, which is three to six orders of magnitude less compared to SOTA methods. A novel preprocessing method is utilized that attains superior performance compared to existing methods for both the mixed-patient and inter-patient paradigms. In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $jκ$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.

Conclusion: LRKV是在内存和计算受限情况下扩展Transformer预训练的实用有效注意力机制。

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

Abstract: Smart grid infrastructures have revolutionized energy distribution, but their day-to-day operations require robust anomaly detection methods to counter risks associated with cyber-physical threats and system faults potentially caused by natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, and cyber attacks. Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Conclusion: 新探针架构有助于应对语言模型滥用问题，架构选择、分布训练等因素对泛化很重要，自动化AI安全研究可行。

Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.

TL;DR: 提出Neuro - Symbolic Activation Discovery框架，发现几何迁移现象，特定激活函数跨领域表现佳且参数效率高，为特定领域激活库开辟道路


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络通用激活函数忽略科学数据固有数学结构，需改进

Method: 使用遗传编程从数据中提取可解释数学公式并作为自定义激活函数

Result: 粒子物理数据学习的激活函数在生态分类中表现优于标准激活函数；混合迁移模型在Forest Cover数据集上参数大幅减少且效率提高；定义参数效率分数证明轻量级架构更高效；发现跨领域迁移的边界条件

Conclusion: 可为高效科学机器学习建立特定领域激活库

Abstract: Modern neural networks rely on generic activation functions (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) that ignore the mathematical structure inherent in scientific data. We propose Neuro-Symbolic Activation Discovery, a framework that uses Genetic Programming to extract interpretable mathematical formulas from data and inject them as custom activation functions. Our key contribution is the discovery of a Geometric Transfer phenomenon: activation functions learned from particle physics data successfully generalize to ecological classification, outperforming standard activations (ReLU, GELU, SiLU) in both accuracy and parameter efficiency. On the Forest Cover dataset, our Hybrid Transfer model achieves 82.4% accuracy with only 5,825 parameters, compared to 83.4% accuracy requiring 31,801 parameters for a conventional heavy network -- a 5.5x parameter reduction with only 1% accuracy loss. We introduce a Parameter Efficiency Score ($E_{param} = AUC / \log_{10}(Params)$) and demonstrate that lightweight hybrid architectures consistently achieve 18-21% higher efficiency than over-parameterized baselines. Crucially, we establish boundary conditions: while Physics to Ecology transfer succeeds (both involve continuous Euclidean measurements), Physics to Text transfer fails (discrete word frequencies require different mathematical structures). Our work opens pathways toward domain-specific activation libraries for efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Neuromorphic vision made significant progress in recent years, thanks to the natural match between spiking neural networks and event data in terms of biological inspiration, energy savings, latency and memory use for dynamic visual data processing. However, optimising its energy requirements still remains a challenge within the community, especially for embedded applications. One solution may reside in preprocessing events to optimise data quantity thus lowering the energy cost on neuromorphic hardware, proportional to the number of synaptic operations. To this end, we extend an end-to-end neuromorphic line detection mechanism to introduce line-based event data preprocessing. Our results demonstrate on three benchmark event-based datasets that preprocessing leads to an advantageous trade-off between energy consumption and classification performance. Depending on the line-based preprocessing strategy and the complexity of the classification task, we show that one can maintain or increase the classification accuracy while significantly reducing the theoretical energy consumption. Our approach systematically leads to a significant improvement of the neuromorphic classification efficiency, thus laying the groundwork towards a more frugal neuromorphic computer vision thanks to event preprocessing.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于进化视角的神经网络剪枝方法，将参数组视为种群，使其在选择压力下进化，验证了该方法在MNIST上产生准确率 - 稀疏性权衡的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的剪枝方法将剪枝视为对训练模型的集中决策，与基于梯度训练的分散、随机和路径依赖特性不一致。

Method: 将参数组建模为种群，参数的影响力在选择压力下不断进化，将神经剪枝形式化为种群质量上的进化过程，推导控制质量进化的选择动态并将适应度与局部学习信号联系起来。

Result: 在MNIST上验证框架，所有动态达到接近98%测试准确率的密集基线，在目标稀疏度水平（35 - 50%）进行训练后硬剪枝，剪枝35%时测试准确率约为95.5%，剪枝50%时约为88.3 - 88.6%。

Conclusion: 进化选择在训练期间无需显式剪枝时间表即可产生可测量的准确率 - 稀疏性权衡。

Abstract: Neural networks are commonly trained in highly overparameterized regimes, yet empirical evidence consistently shows that many parameters become redundant during learning. Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\%): pruning 35\% yields $\approx$95.5\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\% yields $\approx$88.3--88.6\%, depending on the dynamic. These results demonstrate that evolutionary selection produces a measurable accuracy--sparsity tradeoff without explicit pruning schedules during training.

Conclusion: QHDE适合复杂高维投资组合优化，推动了计算金融中量子启发进化研究。

Abstract: High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.

Conclusion: 基于L2范数的突触缩放对提升脉冲神经元WTA网络分类性能效果最佳。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) employing unsupervised learning methods inspired by neural plasticity are expected to be a new framework for artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple types of neural plasticity, such as spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) and synaptic scaling, on the learning in a winner-take-all (WTA) network composed of spiking neurons. We implemented a WTA network with multiple types of neural plasticity using Python. The MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets were used for training and testing. We varied the number of neurons, the time constant of STDP, and the normalization method used in synaptic scaling to compare classification accuracy. The results demonstrated that synaptic scaling based on the L2 norm was the most effective in improving classification performance. By implementing L2-norm-based synaptic scaling and setting the number of neurons in both excitatory and inhibitory layers to 400, the network achieved classification accuracies of 88.84 % on the MNIST dataset and 68.01 % on the Fashion-MNIST dataset after one epoch of training.

Conclusion: 该方法虽有一定运行时间成本，但适用于批量部署，能产生稳定、平衡且节省空间的包装方案。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is a longstanding challenge in operations research and logistics. Classical heuristics and constructive methods can generate packings quickly, but often fail to address industrial constraints such as stability, balance, and handling feasibility. Metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) provide flexibility and the ability to optimize across multiple objectives; however, pure GA approaches frequently struggle with efficiency, parameter sensitivity, and scalability to industrial order sizes. This gap is especially evident when scaling to real-world pallet dimensions, where even state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to achieve robust, deployable solutions. We propose a KPI-driven GA-based pipeline for industrial 3D-BPP that integrates key performance indicators directly into a multi-objective fitness function. The methodology combines a layer-based chromosome representation with domain-specific operators and constructive heuristics to balance efficiency and feasibility. On the BED-BPP benchmark of 1,500 real-world orders, our Hybrid-GA pipeline consistently outperforms heuristic- and learning-based state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher space utilization and 15 to 20% stronger surface support, with lower variance across orders. These improvements come at a modest runtime cost but remain feasible for batch-scale deployment, yielding stable, balanced, and space-efficient packings.

Motivation: 研究差分进化（DE）中的首达时间，避免使用马尔可夫链转移核或漂移论证来分析收敛。

Result: 得到了生存的无分布恒等式和显式尾界；发现L - SHADE在基准套件上有三种经验模式：强聚类成功、近似几何尾部、难处理情况。

Conclusion: 常数风险界虽提供有效尾界，但L - SHADE的实际行为由突发式转变而非均匀的每代成功概率主导。

Abstract: We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event.
  For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative.
  We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.

Abstract: We study d-way balanced allocation, which assigns each incoming job to the lightest loaded among d randomly chosen servers. While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:
  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.
  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results.

Conclusion: LogicLens能有效帮助开发者探索复杂软件系统，利用语义图结构产生有用的涌现能力。

Abstract: Understanding large software systems is a challenging task, especially when code is distributed across multiple repositories and microservices. Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure.

Method: 对23个开源科学软件项目的代码注释、提交消息、拉取请求和问题跟踪器进行多工件分析，构建并验证科学债务数据集，开发多源SATD分类器，进行从业者验证。

Result: 分类器在900,358个工件上表现良好；SATD在拉取请求和问题跟踪器中最普遍；传统SATD模型常遗漏科学债务；从业者确认科学债务可识别且实用。

Conclusion: 科学债务是科学软件中独特的SATD，传统类别无法充分涵盖，需专门识别和管理，研究为科学债务提供了多工件视角，强调需定制检测方法。

Abstract: Context: Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) occurs when developers acknowledge shortcuts in code. In scientific software (SSW), such debt poses unique risks to the validity and reproducibility of results. Objective: This study aims to identify, categorize, and evaluate scientific debt, a specialized form of SATD in SSW, and assess the extent to which traditional SATD categories capture these domain-specific issues. Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW.

Abstract: Networking is central to the growth and visibility of software engineering research and researchers. However, opportunities and capacities to build such networks are not easily identified and often are unevenly distributed. While networking is often viewed as an individual skill, a researchers workplace, culture and environment significantly influence their motivation and, consequently, the networks they form. This paper explores how factors such as country of residence, immigration status, language, gender, and surrounding context affect researchers' ability to establish professional connections and succeed within the global research ecosystem. Drawing on existing literature and personal experience, this reflective report examines the often-invisible barriers to networking and advocates for a community-driven "expert voice" initiative to acknowledge and address these inequities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试生成器未针对PR未覆盖代码，存在“最后一公里”回归测试缺口，需解决该问题以维护软件质量。

Method: 提出ChaCo技术，考虑PR特定补丁覆盖，提取相关测试内容，将增强测试集成到现有测试套件。

Result: 在三个开源项目145个PR上评估，助30% PR实现全补丁覆盖，成本$0.11，人工评审评价高，暴露并修复两个未知bug。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实用，可集成到CI工作流，实现回归测试增强自动化。

Abstract: Software is in constant evolution, with developers frequently submitting pull requests (PRs) to introduce new features or fix bugs. Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a "last-mile" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed. We envision our approach to be integrated into CI workflows, automating the last mile of regression test augmentation.

Motivation: 现有基准主要在静态环境评估代码逻辑，忽略了实际工程动态全过程需求，尤其是后端开发的环境配置和服务部署。

Method: 引入ABC - Bench基准，用可扩展自动化管道从开源仓库整理224个涵盖8种语言和19个框架的实际任务，要求代理管理从仓库探索到容器化服务实例化及通过端到端API测试的整个开发生命周期。

Result: 即使是最先进的模型在整体任务上也难以提供可靠性能。

Conclusion: 当前模型能力与实际后端工程需求存在巨大差距。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has expanded the scope of AI coding from localized code generation to complex, repository-level, and execution-driven problem solving. However, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate code logic in static contexts, neglecting the dynamic, full-process requirements of real-world engineering, particularly in backend development which demands rigorous environment configuration and service deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ABC-Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agentic backend coding within a realistic, executable workflow. Using a scalable automated pipeline, we curated 224 practical tasks spanning 8 languages and 19 frameworks from open-source repositories. Distinct from previous evaluations, ABC-Bench require the agents to manage the entire development lifecycle from repository exploration to instantiating containerized services and pass the external end-to-end API tests. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to deliver reliable performance on these holistic tasks, highlighting a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and the demands of practical backend engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器人对以太坊生态开源讨论的贡献以及是否影响开发者情感基调。

Method: 使用涵盖十个仓库36875个账户、105个验证机器人的数据集，用训练于27种情感类别的模型分析。

Result: 人类参与呈U型模式，机器人在拉取请求和问题处理中有不同表现，机器人更中立，其干预后人类评论中性减少，向感激、钦佩和乐观转变。

Conclusion: 少量机器人与开发者交流的时间和情感动态变化有关。

Abstract: We study how bots contribute to open-source discussions in the Ethereum ecosystem and whether they influence developers' emotional tone. Our dataset covers 36,875 accounts across ten repositories with 105 validated bots (0.28%). Human participation follows a U-shaped pattern, while bots engage in uniform (pull requests) or late-stage (issues) activity. Bots respond faster than humans in pull requests but play slower maintenance roles in issues. Using a model trained on 27 emotion categories, we find bots are more neutral, yet their interventions are followed by reduced neutrality in human comments, with shifts toward gratitude, admiration, and optimism and away from confusion. These findings indicate that even a small number of bots are associated with changes in both timing and emotional dynamics of developer communication.

TL;DR: 对419名GitHub Actions工作流实践者进行调查，揭示开发实践和维护挑战，建议改进工具和支持机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工作流维护对开发者是负担，且缺乏相关自动化和复用实践知识，需明确好的和坏的开发实践及支持维护的机会。

Method: 对419名实践者进行调查，研究自动化任务、创建机制、非功能特性优先级及复用机制。

Result: 自动化集中于核心CI/CD任务，重用Actions依赖高但重用工作流少，存在版本控制和维护挑战，复制粘贴常见。

Conclusion: 需要改进工具，增强对各类自动化任务的支持，优化可重用组件的发现、管理和信任机制。

Abstract: GitHub natively supports workflow automation through GitHub Actions. Yet, workflow maintenance is often considered a burden for software developers, who frequently face difficulties in writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining workflows. Little knowledge exists concerning the automation and reuse practices favoured by workflow practitioners. We therefore surveyed 419 practitioners to elucidate good and bad workflow development practices and to identify opportunities for supporting workflow maintenance. Specifically, we investigate the tasks that practitioners tend to automate using GitHub Actions, their preferred workflow creation mechanisms, and the non-functional characteristics they prioritise. We also examine the practices and challenges associated with GitHub's workflow reuse mechanisms. We observe a tendency to focus automation efforts on core CI/CD tasks, with less emphasis on crucial areas like security analysis and performance monitoring. Practitioners strongly rely on reusable Actions, but reusable workflows see less frequent adoption. Furthermore, we observed challenges with Action versioning and maintenance. Copy-pasting remains a common practice to have more control and avoid the complexity of depending on reusable components. These insights suggest the need for improved tooling, enhanced support for a wide range of automation tasks, and better mechanisms for discovering, managing, and trusting reusable workflow components.

Motivation: 在线用户反馈虽有价值但分析困难，现有工具缺乏端到端集成，限制其实用性。

Method: 开发工具RITA，将轻量级开源大语言模型集成到统一工作流，支持自动请求分类等功能，并与Jira集成。

Result: RITA利用基于LLM的RE技术将原始用户反馈转化为需求工件。

Conclusion: RITA有助于缩小研究与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Context and motivation. Online user feedback is a valuable resource for requirements engineering, but its volume and noise make analysis difficult. Existing tools support individual feedback analysis tasks, but their capabilities are rarely integrated into end-to-end support. Problem. The lack of end-to-end integration limits the practical adoption of existing RE tools and makes it difficult to assess their real-world usefulness. Solution. To address this challenge, we present RITA, a tool that integrates lightweight open-source large language models into a unified workflow for feedback-driven RE. RITA supports automated request classification, non-functional requirement identification, and natural-language requirements specification generation from online feedback via a user-friendly interface, and integrates with Jira for seamless transfer of requirements specifications to development tools. Results and conclusions. RITA exploits previously evaluated LLM-based RE techniques to efficiently transform raw user feedback into requirements artefacts, helping bridge the gap between research and practice.

Result: 形成一份团队建立技术债务管理的指南，区分了“最佳实践”和“可选项”。

Conclusion: 指南旨在提供方向而非严格框架，团队可自主决定流程设计，白皮书未涵盖全公司管理但给出建议。

Abstract: This white paper provides an overview of the topic of "technical debt" and presents an approach for managing technical debt in teams. The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between "best practices" and "nice-to-haves." "Best practices" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. "Nice-to-haves" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 传统PDE方法在高维期权定价和对冲有维度灾难问题，基于MLP的深度BSDE虽有成果但对冲性能待提升，本文提出KANHedge，实验显示其与MLP定价精度相当但对冲性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于MLP的深度BSDE在期权对冲性能方面存在的提升空间问题。

Method: 引入KANHedge，在BSDE框架下利用Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks（KANs），KANs采用可学习的B样条激活函数。

Result: KANHedge和MLP定价精度相当，但KANHedge能显著降低对冲成本指标，展现出更好的风险控制能力。

Conclusion: KANHedge在期权定价和对冲中具有优势，尤其在对冲性能上表现更佳。

Abstract: High-dimensional option pricing and hedging present significant challenges in quantitative finance, where traditional PDE-based methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality. The BSDE framework offers a computationally efficient alternative to PDE-based methods, and recently proposed deep BSDE solvers, generally utilizing conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), build upon this framework to provide a scalable alternative to numerical BSDE solvers. In this research, we show that although such MLP-based deep BSDEs demonstrate promising results in option pricing, there remains room for improvement regarding hedging performance. To address this issue, we introduce KANHedge, a novel BSDE-based hedger that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the BSDE framework. Unlike conventional MLP approaches that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable B-spline activation functions that provide enhanced function approximation capabilities for continuous derivatives. We comprehensively evaluate KANHedge on both European and American basket options across multiple dimensions and market conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while KANHedge and MLP achieve comparable pricing accuracy, KANHedge provides improved hedging performance. Specifically, KANHedge achieves considerable reductions in hedging cost metrics, demonstrating enhanced risk control capabilities.

Method: 提出一种非参数方法，可看作线性插值方案的平滑推广；将模型校准为线性规划。

Result: 计算成本比多数现有隐含波动率曲面拟合程序低；得到基于严格正“离散局部波动率”变量的等效参数化表示。

Conclusion: 该方法能构建平滑、严格无套利的期权价格曲面，只需简单的参数约束（正性），并用标普500指数期权进行了说明。

Abstract: We present a simple, numerically efficient but highly flexible non-parametric method to construct representations of option price surfaces which are both smooth and strictly arbitrage-free across time and strike. The method can be viewed as a smooth generalization of the widely-known linear interpolation scheme, and retains the simplicity and transparency of that baseline. Calibration of the model to observed market quotes is formulated as a linear program, allowing bid-ask spreads to be incorporated directly via linear penalties or inequalities, and delivering materially lower computational cost than most of the currently available implied-volatility surface fitting routines. As a further contribution, we derive an equivalent parameterization of the proposed surface in terms of strictly positive "discrete local volatility" variables. This yields, to our knowledge, the first construction of smooth, strictly arbitrage-free option price surfaces while requiring only trivial parameter constraints (positivity). We illustrate the approach using S&P 500 index options

Conclusion: 研究成果突破了传统线性化流动性模型，稳定币脱钩保险在法律禁止稳定币付息时有重要作用。

Abstract: Three traits of decentralized finance are studied. First, the market impact function is derived for optimal-growth liquidity providers. For a standard random walk, the classic square-root impact is recovered. An extension is then derived to fit general fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. These findings break with the linearized liquidity models used in most decentralized exchanges. Second, a Constant Product Market Maker is viewed as a multi-phase Carnot engine, where one phase matches the exchange of tokens by a liquidity taker, and another the change of pool size by a liquidity provider. Third, stablecoin de-pegging is a form of catastrophe risk. By using growth optimization, default odds are linked to the cost of catastrophe bonds. De-pegging insurance can act as a counterweight and a key marketing tool when the law forbids the payment of interest on stablecoins.

Conclusion: 9天提前期可支持风险管理决策，Granger因果不代表结构因果，经济解释是假设。

Abstract: We document regime-dependent predictive structure between equity factors using 35 years of Fama-French data (1990-2024). We find that Value (HML) Granger-causes Size (SMB) during crisis regimes (p < 1e-4, 9-day lag) but not during normal conditions, validating across 5 of 6 historical stress events (2008, 2011, 2015, 2018, 2020). Regimes are identified via a Student-t HMM, which detects moderate crises such as 2011 (69%) that Gaussian models miss entirely (0%). Although the relationship does not yield trading profits, the 9-day lead time may support risk management decisions. We note that Granger causality implies temporal precedence, not structural causality, and that common drivers could explain the pattern; our economic interpretation is a hypothesis rather than a verified mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解rBergomi模型多尺度行为主要源于波动率路径的粗糙度还是厚尾回报，对金融建模、期权定价和风险管理有重要意义。

Method: 引入两阶段统计测试程序，第一阶段用加权最小二乘法量化多尺度；第二阶段用基于距离的置换检验应用打乱替代法。还用具有已知多重分形特性的合成过程验证。

Result: 有充分证据表明rBergomi模型的多尺度主要源于厚尾回报分布。

Conclusion: 粗糙波动率模型中明显的多尺度很大程度上归因于分布特性而非真正的时间尺度行为。

Abstract: The rough Bergomi (rBergomi) model, characterised by its roughness parameter $H$, has been shown to exhibit multiscaling behaviour as $H$ approaches zero. Multiscaling has profound implications for financial modelling: it affects extreme risk estimation, influences optimal portfolio allocation across different time horizons, and challenges traditional option pricing approaches that assume uniscaling behaviours. Understanding whether multiscaling arises primarily from the roughness of volatility paths or from the resulting fat-tailed returns has important implications for financial modelling, option pricing, and risk management. This paper investigates the real source of this multiscaling behaviour by introducing a novel two-stage statistical testing procedure. In the first stage, we establish the presence of multiscaling in the rBergomi model against an uniscaling fractional Brownian motion process. We quantify multiscaling by using weighted least squares regression that accounts for heteroscedastic estimation errors across moments. In the second stage, we apply shuffled surrogates that preserve return distributions while destroying temporal correlations. This is done by using distance-based permutation tests robust to asymmetric null distributions. In order to validate our procedure, we check the robustness of the results by using synthetic processes with known multifractal properties, namely the Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) and the Fractional Lévy Stable Motion (FLSM). We provide compelling evidence that multiscaling in the rBergomi model arises primarily from fat-tailed return distributions rather than memory effects. Our findings suggest that the apparent multiscaling in rough volatility models is largely attributable to distributional properties rather than genuine temporal scaling behaviour.

Motivation: 发现密度分布存在高密度偏差的根本局限，现有基于密度的聚类算法无法完全解决此问题，阻碍发现任意形状、大小和密度的簇。

Method: 提出以质量分布为基础的质量最大化聚类（MMC）算法，还可修改算法以最大化密度来对比。

Result: MMC算法在最大化过程中不会偏向于密集簇。

Conclusion: 质量分布作为聚类基础比密度分布更优，MMC算法具有优势。

Abstract: This paper investigates two fundamental descriptors of data, i.e., density distribution versus mass distribution, in the context of clustering. Density distribution has been the de facto descriptor of data distribution since the introduction of statistics. We show that density distribution has its fundamental limitation -- high-density bias, irrespective of the algorithms used to perform clustering. Existing density-based clustering algorithms have employed different algorithmic means to counter the effect of the high-density bias with some success, but the fundamental limitation of using density distribution remains an obstacle to discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes and densities. Using the mass distribution as a better foundation, we propose a new algorithm which maximizes the total mass of all clusters, called mass-maximization clustering (MMC). The algorithm can be easily changed to maximize the total density of all clusters in order to examine the fundamental limitation of using density distribution versus mass distribution. The key advantage of the MMC over the density-maximization clustering is that the maximization is conducted without a bias towards dense clusters.

Conclusion: IMBoost框架有效提升了异常检测性能，在性能和计算成本上有优势。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) aims to identify abnormal instances, known as outliers or anomalies, by learning typical patterns of normal data, or inliers. Performing OD under an unsupervised regime-without any information about anomalous instances in the training data-is challenging. A recently observed phenomenon, known as the inlier-memorization (IM) effect, where deep generative models (DGMs) tend to memorize inlier patterns during early training, provides a promising signal for distinguishing outliers. However, existing unsupervised approaches that rely solely on the IM effect still struggle when inliers and outliers are not well-separated or when outliers form dense clusters. To address these limitations, we incorporate active learning to selectively acquire informative labels, and propose IMBoost, a novel framework that explicitly reinforces the IM effect to improve outlier detection. Our method consists of two stages: 1) a warm-up phase that induces and promotes the IM effect, and 2) a polarization phase in which actively queried samples are used to maximize the discrepancy between inlier and outlier scores. In particular, we propose a novel query strategy and tailored loss function in the polarization phase to effectively identify informative samples and fully leverage the limited labeling budget. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the IMBoost consistently decreases inlier risk while increasing outlier risk throughout training, thereby amplifying their separation. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMBoost not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art active OD methods but also requires substantially less computational cost.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a framework for contextual distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that considers the causal and continuous structure of the underlying distribution by developing interpretable and tractable decision rules that prescribe decisions using covariates. We first introduce the causal Sinkhorn discrepancy (CSD), an entropy-regularized causal Wasserstein distance that encourages continuous transport plans while preserving the causal consistency. We then formulate a contextual DRO model with a CSD-based ambiguity set, termed Causal Sinkhorn DRO (Causal-SDRO), and derive its strong dual reformulation where the worst-case distribution is characterized as a mixture of Gibbs distributions. To solve the corresponding infinite-dimensional policy optimization, we propose the Soft Regression Forest (SRF) decision rule, which approximates optimal policies within arbitrary measurable function spaces. The SRF preserves the interpretability of classical decision trees while being fully parametric, differentiable, and Lipschitz smooth, enabling intrinsic interpretation from both global and local perspectives. To solve the Causal-SDRO with parametric decision rules, we develop an efficient stochastic compositional gradient algorithm that converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point at a rate of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$, matching the convergence rate of standard stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we validate our method through numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: 所提分布式框架有效，能降维矩阵多元时间序列数据，有良好计算和预测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional, large-scale, heterogeneous matrix-variate time series data using a factor model. The data are first partitioned column-wise (or row-wise) and allocated to node servers, where each node estimates the row (or column) loading matrix via two-dimensional tensor PCA. These local estimates are then transmitted to a central server and aggregated, followed by a final PCA step to obtain the global row (or column) loading matrix estimator. Given the estimated loading matrices, the corresponding factor matrices are subsequently computed. Unlike existing distributed approaches, our framework preserves the latent matrix structure, thereby improving computational efficiency and enhancing information utilization. We also discuss row- and column-wise clustering procedures for settings in which the group memberships are unknown. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to unit-root nonstationary matrix-variate time series. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each computing unit and the sample size $T$. Simulation results assess the computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of the proposed framework, and real data applications further validate its predictive performance.

The simplicity and broad applicability of our approach open new opportunities for Bayesian modeling and computation with heavy-tailed distributions in settings where most existing methods are unreliable.

Abstract: Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) with Matérn covariance functions have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling spatial processes due to their flexibility in capturing different features of the spatial field. However, the smoothness parameter is challenging to estimate using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which involves evaluating the likelihood based on the full covariance matrix of the GRF, due to numerical instability. Moreover, MLE remains computationally prohibitive for large spatial datasets. To address this challenge, we propose the Fisher-BackTracking (Fisher-BT) method, which integrates the Fisher scoring algorithm with a backtracking line search strategy and adopts a series approximation for the modified Bessel function. This method enables an efficient MLE estimation for spatial datasets using the ExaGeoStat high-performance computing framework. Our proposed method not only reduces the number of iterations and accelerates convergence compared to derivative-free optimization methods but also improves the numerical stability of the smoothness parameter estimation. Through simulations and real-data analysis using a soil moisture dataset covering the Mississippi River Basin, we show that the proposed Fisher-BT method achieves accuracy comparable to existing approaches while significantly outperforming derivative-free algorithms such as BOBYQA and Nelder-Mead in terms of computational efficiency and numerical stability.

Motivation: 改进SCAD阈值规则，使其具备更好的数学特性和计算便利性，以应用于小波去噪。

Result: 得到的规则具有连续性、可微性等特性，适用Stein无偏风险估计，有明确的SURE风险表达式。

Conclusion: 平滑SCAD规则是对SCAD的有效改进，在小波收缩过程中兼顾低偏差、精确稀疏性和分析便利性。

Abstract: We introduce a smooth variant of the SCAD thresholding rule for wavelet denoising by replacing its piecewise linear transition with a raised cosine. The resulting shrinkage function is odd, continuous on R, and continuously differentiable away from the main threshold, yet retains the hallmark SCAD properties of sparsity for small coefficients and near unbiasedness for large ones. This smoothness places the rule within the continuous thresholding class for which Stein's unbiased risk estimate is valid. As a result, unbiased risk computation, stable data-driven threshold selection, and the asymptotic theory of Kudryavtsev and Shestakov apply.
  A corresponding nonconvex prior is obtained whose posterior mode coincides with the estimator, yielding a transparent Bayesian interpretation. We give an explicit SURE risk expression, discuss the oracle scale of the optimal threshold, and describe both global and level-dependent adaptive versions. The smooth SCAD rule therefore offers a tractable refinement of SCAD, combining low bias, exact sparsity, and analytical convenience in a single wavelet shrinkage procedure.

Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer collision operators from phase space data of plasma dynamics. Our approach combines a differentiable kinetic simulator, whose core component in this work is a differentiable Fokker-Planck solver, with a gradient-based optimisation method to learn the collisional operators that best describe the phase space dynamics. We test our method using data from two-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations of spatially uniform thermal plasmas, and learn the collision operator that captures the self-consistent electromagnetic interaction between finite-size charged particles over a wide variety of simulation parameters. We demonstrate that the learned operators are more accurate than alternative estimates based on particle tracks, while making no prior assumptions about the relevant time-scales of the processes and significantly reducing memory requirements. We find that the retrieved operators, obtained in the non-relativistic regime, are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions derived for electrostatic scenarios. Our results show that differentiable simulators offer a powerful and computational efficient approach to infer novel operators for a wide rage of problems, such as electromagnetically dominated collisional dynamics and stochastic wave-particle interactions.

Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models generalize the classical Hopfield model by incorporating n-body or exponential interactions that greatly enhance storage capacity. While the criticality of DAM models has been largely investigated, mainly within a statistical equilibrium picture, little attention has been devoted to the temporal self-organizing behavior induced by learning. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a stochastic exponential DAM (SEDAM) model through the lens of Temporal Complexity (TC), a framework that characterizes complex systems by intermittent transition events between order and disorder and by scale-free temporal statistics. Transition events associated with birth-death of neural avalanche structures are exploited for the TC analyses and compared with analogous transition events based on coincidence structures. We systematically explore how TC indicators depend on control parameters, i.e., noise intensity and memory load. Our results reveal that the SEDAM model exhibits regimes of complex intermittency characterized by nontrivial temporal correlations and scale-free behavior, indicating the spontaneous emergence of self-organizing dynamics. These regimes emerge in small intervals of noise intensity values, which, in agreement with the extended criticality concept, never shrink to a single critical point. Further, the noise intensity range needed to reach the critical region, where self-organizing behavior emerges, slightly decreases as the memory load increases. This study highlights the relevance of TC as a complementary framework for understanding learning and information processing in artificial and biological neural systems, revealing the link between the memory load and the self-organizing capacity of the network.

Result: 消除了惩罚系数、对偶变量和特定问题构造，保留单次训练效率，数值实验验证了框架。

Conclusion: NP - PIELM能精确满足离散配置点的边界条件，是有效的方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed extreme learning machines (PIELMs) typically impose boundary and initial conditions through penalty terms, yielding only approximate satisfaction that is sensitive to user-specified weights and can propagate errors into the interior solution. This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency. Numerical experiments on elliptic and parabolic problems including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions validate the framework.

Abstract: The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS~2) has emerged as a relevant middleware framework for robotic applications, offering modularity, distributed execution, and communication. In the last six years, ROS~2 has drawn increasing attention from the real-time systems community and industry. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of research efforts that analyze, enhance, and extend ROS~2 to support real-time execution. We first provide a detailed description of the internal scheduling mechanisms of ROS~2 and its layered architecture, including the interaction with DDS-based communication and other communication middleware. We then review key contributions from the literature, covering timing analysis for both single- and multi-threaded executors, metrics such as response time, reaction time, and data age, and different communication modes. The survey also discusses community-driven enhancements to the ROS~2 runtime, including new executor algorithm designs, real-time GPU management, and microcontroller support via micro-ROS. Furthermore, we summarize techniques for bounding DDS communication delays, message filters, and profiling tools that have been developed to support analysis and experimentation. To help systematize this growing body of work, we introduce taxonomies that classify the surveyed contributions based on different criteria. This survey aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in understanding and improving the real-time capabilities of ROS~2.

Result: 在有挑战性的接触丰富任务中，优于领先规划器，任务成本降低61%，250次查询成功率达91%，查询时间保持在一分钟以内。

Conclusion: 全局优化的接触丰富操作在现实任务中具有实用性。

Abstract: If we consider human manipulation, it is clear that contact-rich manipulation (CRM)-the ability to use any surface of the manipulator to make contact with objects-can be far more efficient and natural than relying solely on end-effectors (i.e., fingertips). However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%. It also achieves a 91% success rate across 250 queries and maintains sub-minute query times, ultimately demonstrating that globally optimized contact-rich manipulation is now practical for real-world tasks.

Abstract: In embodied artificial intelligence, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to execute long-horizon tasks from high-level instructions remains a critical challenge. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that H-AIM achieves a remarkable performance improvement, elevating the task success rate from 12% to 55% and boosting the goal condition recall from 32% to 72% against the strongest baseline, LaMMA-P.

Conclusion: 所提A3D框架可助力机器人更有效完成家具装配任务

Abstract: Furniture assembly is a crucial yet challenging task for robots, requiring precise dual-arm coordination where one arm manipulates parts while the other provides collaborative support and stabilization. To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Marker-based landing is widely used in drone delivery and return-to-base systems for its simplicity and reliability. However, most approaches assume idealized landing site visibility and sensor performance, limiting robustness in complex urban settings. We present a simulation-based evaluation suite on the AirSim platform with systematically varied urban layouts, lighting, and weather to replicate realistic operational diversity. Using onboard camera sensors (RGB for marker detection and depth for obstacle avoidance), we benchmark two heuristic coverage patterns and a reinforcement learning-based agent, analyzing how exploration strategy and scene complexity affect success rate, path efficiency, and robustness. Results underscore the need to evaluate marker-based autonomous landing under diverse, sensor-relevant conditions to guide the development of reliable aerial navigation systems.

Abstract: The simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer of large-scale hydraulic robots presents a significant challenge in robotics because of the inherent slow control response and complex fluid dynamics. The complex dynamics result from the multiple interconnected cylinder structure and the difference in fluid rates of the cylinders. These characteristics complicate detailed simulation for all joints, making it unsuitable for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. In this work, we propose an analytical actuator model driven by hydraulic dynamics to represent the complicated actuators. The model predicts joint torques for all 12 actuators in under 1 microsecond, allowing rapid processing in RL environments. We compare our model with neural network-based actuator models and demonstrate the advantages of our model in data-limited scenarios. The locomotion policy trained in RL with our model is deployed on a hydraulic quadruped robot, which is over 300 kg. This work is the first demonstration of a successful transfer of stable and robust command-tracking locomotion with RL on a heavy hydraulic quadruped robot, demonstrating advanced sim-to-real transferability.

Abstract: Recently, with the rapid development of robot learning and imitation learning, numerous datasets and methods have emerged. However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models. Our data and code are available at https://rhos.ai/research/gm-100.

Abstract: Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are transforming information seeking, but their fluent, authoritative responses risk overreliance and discourage independent verification and reasoning. Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a "time-on-chat vs. exploration" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information. Qualitative findings reveal tension between the copilot's Socratic approach and users' desire for efficiency. These results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of pedagogical copilots, and we outline design pathways to reconcile literacy goals with efficiency demands.

Abstract: Many users struggle with effective online search and critical evaluation, especially in high-stakes domains like health, while often overestimating their digital literacy. Thus, in this demo, we present an interactive search companion that seamlessly integrates expert search strategies into existing search engine result pages. Providing context-aware tips on clarifying information needs, improving query formulation, encouraging result exploration, and mitigating biases, our companion aims to foster reflective search behaviour while minimising cognitive burden. A user study demonstrates the companion's successful encouragement of more active and exploratory search, leading users to submit 75 % more queries and view roughly twice as many results, as well as performance gains in difficult tasks. This demo illustrates how lightweight, contextual guidance can enhance search literacy and empower users through micro-learning opportunities. While the vision involves real-time LLM adaptivity, this study utilises a controlled implementation to test the underlying intervention strategies.

Abstract: We examine whether large language models (LLMs) can predict biased decision-making in conversational settings, and whether their predictions capture not only human cognitive biases but also how those effects change under cognitive load. In a pre-registered study (N = 1,648), participants completed six classic decision-making tasks via a chatbot with dialogues of varying complexity. Participants exhibited two well-documented cognitive biases: the Framing Effect and the Status Quo Bias. Increased dialogue complexity resulted in participants reporting higher mental demand. This increase in cognitive load selectively, but significantly, increased the effect of the biases, demonstrating the load-bias interaction. We then evaluated whether LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-5, and open-source models) could predict individual decisions given demographic information and prior dialogue. While results were mixed across choice problems, LLM predictions that incorporated dialogue context were significantly more accurate in several key scenarios. Importantly, their predictions reproduced the same bias patterns and load-bias interactions observed in humans. Across all models tested, the GPT-4 family consistently aligned with human behavior, outperforming GPT-5 and open-source models in both predictive accuracy and fidelity to human-like bias patterns. These findings advance our understanding of LLMs as tools for simulating human decision-making and inform the design of conversational agents that adapt to user biases.

Result: 得到包含超33.9万用户和约3900万条消息的数据集，可进行一致和可比的干预效果分析。

Conclusion: TBBT数据集能支持研究人员对审核干预效果的研究，推动更系统、可重复和可比的研究。

Abstract: Online platforms rely on moderation interventions to curb harmful behavior such hate speech, toxicity, and the spread of mis- and disinformation. Yet research on the effects and possible biases of such interventions faces multiple limitations. For example, existing works frequently focus on single or a few interventions, due to the absence of comprehensive datasets. As a result, researchers must typically collect the necessary data for each new study, which limits opportunities for systematic comparisons. To overcome these challenges, we introduce The Big Ban Theory (TBBT), a large dataset of moderation interventions. TBBT covers 25 interventions of varying type, severity, and scope, comprising in total over 339K users and nearly 39M posted messages. For each intervention, we provide standardized metadata and pseudonymized user activity collected three months before and after its enforcement, enabling consistent and comparable analyses of intervention effects. In addition, we provide a descriptive exploratory analysis of the dataset, along with several use cases of how it can support research on content moderation. With this dataset, we aim to support researchers studying the effects of moderation interventions and to promote more systematic, reproducible, and comparable research. TBBT is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18245670.

Motivation: 抑郁症影响生活质量，传统诊断依赖主观自评不可靠，需要客观准确方法识别抑郁状态。

Method: 提出基于深度学习的框架，结合CNN和GRU提取EEG记录的时空特征，用MRMR算法选择特征，再用全连接神经网络分类。

Result: 所提模型在识别抑郁状态上表现出色，总体准确率达98.74%。

Conclusion: 该框架能准确早期检测抑郁，有潜力改善治疗策略和患者预后。

Abstract: This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 多数集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统需分配感知和通信时间，但该决策对感知性能的影响尚不明确，本文旨在探究其对毫米波ISAC手势识别系统的影响。

Method: 使用两个毫米波设备收集不同手势下每波束对的功率数据集，用卷积神经网络训练手势分类器，对测量数据进行下采样以模拟减少的感知时间。

Result: 25%的感知时间仅使分类准确率比全时感知降低0.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 毫米波ISAC系统能在低感知时间下实现高质量感知，且具有高数据吞吐量，适合无线扩展现实等应用。

Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.

Result: 在10dB医院噪声下滤波后平均SNR为12.98dB，滤波后分类敏感度从27%提升到88%。

Conclusion: 该模型在实际嘈杂环境中保留病理特征能力有前景。

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.

Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.

TL;DR: 本文利用柏林和曼哈顿数据对交通传感器优化布局策略进行大规模基准测试，发现强调均匀空间覆盖和主动学习的策略预测误差最低，时空部署原则可提升性能，城市采用数据驱动策略能提升数据效用。

Motivation: 现有交通传感器部署因行政优先而非数据驱动优化，导致覆盖有偏差、估计性能降低，需优化传感器布局。

Method: 使用柏林和曼哈顿的路段级数据，对比基于网络中心性、空间覆盖、特征覆盖和主动学习的空间布局策略，研究临时传感器的时间部署方案。

Result: 强调均匀空间覆盖和采用主动学习的空间布局策略预测误差最低，仅10个传感器时，柏林和曼哈顿的平均绝对误差分别降低超60%和70%；均匀分布测量时间可进一步降低误差；时空原则使临时部署接近永久部署性能。

Conclusion: 城市采用数据驱动的传感器布局策略可大幅提升数据效用，且在临时和永久部署选择上有灵活性。

Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.

Conclusion: MOMPnet能有效解决传统方法的可靠性和复杂度挑战，有应用潜力。

Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.

Conclusion: CR - DMD是一种能有效对抗混合噪声的DMD框架，优于现有鲁棒DMD方法。

Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: 分析了基于In - CVaR的非线性回归模型在扰动和污染下的稳健性，说明In - CVaR风险度量在理论和数值实验上相比条件风险价值和期望在稳健回归中有优势。

Abstract: Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 数值实验表明所提方法有效。

Abstract: We study model-free policy learning for discrete-time mean-field control (MFC) problems with finite state space and compact action space. In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We present a novel probabilistic approach for optimal path experimental design. In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal technology in the operation of large and complex systems, driving advancements in fields such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial fraud detection. Despite its benefits, the deployment of ML models brings significant security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of these systems. To address these challenges, this paper builds upon the concept of Secure Machine Learning Operations (SecMLOps), providing a comprehensive framework designed to integrate robust security measures throughout the entire ML operations (MLOps) lifecycle. SecMLOps builds on the principles of MLOps by embedding security considerations from the initial design phase through to deployment and continuous monitoring. This framework is particularly focused on safeguarding against sophisticated attacks that target various stages of the MLOps lifecycle, thereby enhancing the resilience and trustworthiness of ML applications. A detailed advanced pedestrian detection system (PDS) use case demonstrates the practical application of SecMLOps in securing critical MLOps. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we highlight the trade-offs between security measures and system performance, providing critical insights into optimizing security without unduly impacting operational efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach, offering valuable guidance for practitioners on how to achieve an optimal balance between security and performance in ML deployments across various domains.

Method: 提出SemTaint，使用静态程序分析计算调用图，用LLM解决无法静态解析的调用边、分类源和汇，将污点规范交给SAST工具。

Conclusion: LLMs可增强现有静态程序分析算法，结合符号推理和语义理解优势提升漏洞检测能力。

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools using taint analysis are widely viewed as providing higher-quality vulnerability detection results compared to traditional pattern-based approaches. However, performing static taint analysis for JavaScript poses two major challenges. First, JavaScript's dynamic features complicate data flow extraction required for taint tracking. Second, npm's large library ecosystem makes it difficult to identify relevant sources/sinks and establish taint propagation across dependencies. In this paper, we present SemTaint, a multi-agent system that strategically combines the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional static program analysis to extract taint specifications, including sources, sinks, call edges, and library flow summaries tailored to each package. Conceptually, SemTaint uses static program analysis to calculate a call graph and defers to an LLM to resolve call edges that cannot be resolved statically. Further, it uses the LLM to classify sources and sinks for a given CWE. The resulting taint specification is then provided to a SAST tool, which performs vulnerability analysis. We integrate SemTaint with CodeQL, a state-of-the-art SAST tool, and demonstrate its effectiveness by detecting 106 of 162 vulnerabilities previously undetectable by CodeQL. Furthermore, we find 4 novel vulnerabilities in 4 popular npm packages. In doing so, we demonstrate that LLMs can practically enhance existing static program analysis algorithms, combining the strengths of both symbolic reasoning and semantic understanding for improved vulnerability detection.

TL;DR: 提出针对大语言模型代理工具层的隐蔽多轮经济DoS攻击，在多个基准测试中造成成本、能耗大幅提升等问题，凸显代理工具接口安全重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DoS攻击对大语言模型代理的代理 - 工具通信循环无效，缺乏多轮和面向任务的方法。

Method: 在兼容MCP的工具服务器调整文本可见字段和返回策略，用MCTS优化器优化，通过文本通知使代理进入长时间工具调用序列。

Result: 在多个基准测试的六个大语言模型上，任务扩展超60000个令牌，成本最多提升658倍，能耗提升100 - 560倍等。

Conclusion: 代理 - 工具接口成为重要安全前沿，需从验证最终答案转向监控整个代理过程的经济和计算成本。

Abstract: The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.

Conclusion: SD - RAG方法在保障检索增强生成的安全和隐私方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has attracted significant attention due to its ability to combine the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge obtained through efficient retrieval mechanisms over large-scale data collections. Currently, the majority of existing approaches overlook the risks associated with exposing sensitive or access-controlled information directly to the generation model. Only a few approaches propose techniques to instruct the generative model to refrain from disclosing sensitive information; however, recent studies have also demonstrated that LLMs remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can override intended behavioral constraints. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach to Selective Disclosure in Retrieval-Augmented Generation, called SD-RAG, which decouples the enforcement of security and privacy constraints from the generation process itself. Rather than relying on prompt-level safeguards, SD-RAG applies sanitization and disclosure controls during the retrieval phase, prior to augmenting the language model's input. Moreover, we introduce a semantic mechanism to allow the ingestion of human-readable dynamic security and privacy constraints together with an optimized graph-based data model that supports fine-grained, policy-aware retrieval. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the superiority of SD-RAG over baseline existing approaches, achieving up to a $58\%$ improvement in the privacy score, while also showing a strong resilience to prompt injection attacks targeting the generative model.

Abstract: Backdoored and privacy-leaking deep neural networks pose a serious threat to the deployment of machine learning systems in security-critical settings. Existing defenses for backdoor detection and membership inference typically require access to clean reference models, extensive retraining, or strong assumptions about the attack mechanism. In this work, we introduce a novel LoRA-based oracle framework that leverages low-rank adaptation modules as a lightweight, model-agnostic probe for both backdoor detection and membership inference.
  Our approach attaches task-specific LoRA adapters to a frozen backbone and analyzes their optimization dynamics and representation shifts when exposed to suspicious samples. We show that poisoned and member samples induce distinctive low-rank updates that differ significantly from those generated by clean or non-member data. These signals can be measured using simple ranking and energy-based statistics, enabling reliable inference without access to the original training data or modification of the deployed model.

Result: 检测准确率达98.7%，延迟开销<=3%，吞吐量>250万次推理/秒，硬件占用少，对设计频率影响可忽略。

Abstract: In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.

Conclusion: LIVI能有效平衡音乐翻唱检索的准确性和计算效率，挑战了复杂流程的主导地位。

Abstract: Music Cover Retrieval, also known as Version Identification, aims to recognize distinct renditions of the same underlying musical work, a task central to catalog management, copyright enforcement, and music retrieval. State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art transcription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with--or superior to--harmonic-based systems. Second, LIVI remains lightweight and efficient by removing the transcription step at inference, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy pipelines.

Result: DSA - Tokenizer能实现高保真重建和灵活重组，提升语音生成质量。

Conclusion: 解耦分词是未来语音建模的关键范式。

Abstract: Speech tokenizers serve as the cornerstone of discrete Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). Existing tokenizers either prioritize semantic encoding, fuse semantic content with acoustic style inseparably, or achieve incomplete semantic-acoustic disentanglement. To achieve better disentanglement, we propose DSA-Tokenizer, which explicitly disentangles speech into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens via distinct optimization constraints. Specifically, semantic tokens are supervised by ASR to capture linguistic content, while acoustic tokens focus on mel-spectrograms restoration to encode style. To eliminate rigid length constraints between the two sequences, we introduce a hierarchical Flow-Matching decoder that further improve speech generation quality. Furthermore, We employ a joint reconstruction-recombination training strategy to enforce this separation. DSA-Tokenizer enables high fidelity reconstruction and flexible recombination through robust disentanglement, facilitating controllable generation in speech LLMs. Our analysis highlights disentangled tokenization as a pivotal paradigm for future speech modeling. Audio samples are avaialble at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DSA_Tokenizer_demo/. The code and model will be made publicly available after the paper has been accepted.

Conclusion: 统一自回归架构能在不同语音任务中取得有竞争力的性能，适合低延迟实际部署

Abstract: Traditional speech systems typically rely on separate, task-specific models for text-to-speech (TTS), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and voice conversion (VC), resulting in fragmented pipelines that limit scalability, efficiency, and cross-task generalization. In this paper, we present General-Purpose Audio (GPA), a unified audio foundation model that integrates multiple core speech tasks within a single large language model (LLM) architecture. GPA operates on a shared discrete audio token space and supports instruction-driven task induction, enabling a single autoregressive model to flexibly perform TTS, ASR, and VC without architectural modifications. This unified design combines a fully autoregressive formulation over discrete speech tokens, joint multi-task training across speech domains, and a scalable inference pipeline that achieves high concurrency and throughput. The resulting model family supports efficient multi-scale deployment, including a lightweight 0.3B-parameter variant optimized for edge and resource-constrained environments. Together, these design choices demonstrate that a unified autoregressive architecture can achieve competitive performance across diverse speech tasks while remaining viable for low-latency, practical deployment.

Abstract: We extend resource-bounded type theory to Martin-Lof type theory (MLTT) with dependent types, enabling size-indexed cost bounds for programs over inductive families.
  We introduce a resource-indexed universe hierarchy U_r where r is an element of L and tracks the cost of type formation, and a graded modality Box_r for feasibility certification. Our main results are: (1) a cost soundness theorem showing that synthesized bounds over-approximate operational costs, with bounds expressed as functions of size indices; (2) a semantic model in the presheaf topos over L, extended with dependent presheaves and a comprehension structure; (3) canonicity for the intensional fragment; and (4) initiality of the syntactic model. We demonstrate the framework with case studies including length-indexed vector operations with linear bounds and binary search with logarithmic bounds, both expressed in the type.
  This work bridges the gap between dependent type theory and quantitative resource analysis, enabling certified cost bounds for size-dependent algorithms.

Abstract: While using formal methods offers advantages over unit testing, their steep learning curve can be daunting to developers and can be a major impediment to widespread adoption. To support integration into an industrial software engineering workflow, a tool must provide useful information and must be usable with relatively minimal user effort. In this paper, we discuss our experiences associated with identifying and applying formal methods tools on an electronic warfare (EW) system with stringent safety requirements and present perspectives on formal methods tools from EW software engineers who are proficient in development yet lack formal methods training. In addition to a difference in mindset between formal methods and unit testing approaches, some formal methods tools use terminology or annotations that differ from their target programming language, creating another barrier to adoption. Input/output contracts, objects in memory affected by a function, and loop invariants can be difficult to grasp and use. In addition to usability, our findings include a comparison of vulnerabilities detected by different tools. Finally, we present suggestions for improving formal methods usability including better documentation of capabilities, decreased manual effort, and improved handling of library code.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots built for mental health could deliver safe, personalized, and scalable mental health support. We evaluate a foundation model designed for mental health. Adults completed mental health measures while engaging with the chatbot between May 15, 2025 and September 15, 2025. Users completed an opt-in consent, demographic information, mental health symptoms, social connection, and self-identified goals. Measures were repeated every two weeks up to 6 weeks, and a final follow-up at 10 weeks. Analyses included effect sizes, and growth mixture models to identify participant groups and their characteristic engagement, severity, and demographic factors. Users demonstrated significant reductions in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 that were sustained at follow-up. Significant improvements in Hope, Behavioral Activation, Social Interaction, Loneliness, and Perceived Social Support were observed throughout and maintained at 10 week follow-up. Engagement was high and predicted outcomes. Working alliance was comparable to traditional care and predicted outcomes. Automated safety guardrails functioned as designed, with 76 sessions flagged for risk and all handled according to escalation policies. This single arm naturalistic observational study provides initial evidence that a GAI foundation model for mental health can deliver accessible, engaging, effective, and safe mental health support. These results lend support to findings from early randomized designs and offer promise for future study of mental health GAI in real world settings.

Abstract: Fairness in automated decision-making has become a critical concern, particularly in high-pressure healthcare scenarios such as emergency triage, where fast and equitable decisions are essential. Process mining is increasingly investigating fairness. There is a growing area focusing on fairness-aware algorithms. So far, we know less how these concepts perform on empirical healthcare data or how they cover aspects of justice theory. This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface. In this way, this study contributes empirical insights that support further research in responsible, fairness-aware process mining in healthcare.

With this new understanding of the problem, I then argue against Humphreys pessimistic view. Finally, I construct a more nuanced view of epistemic control in ML-based science.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可提示分割基础模型直接用于医学图像分割受领域偏移、缺乏空间提示和需复杂推理等限制，且SAM3在医学数据上性能下降。

Method: 在大规模、异构2D和3D医学影像数据集上对SAM3进行全量微调。

Result: 在多器官、成像模式和维度的实验中，Medical SAM3性能显著提升，尤其在复杂场景。

Conclusion: Medical SAM3是通用的文本引导医学影像分割基础模型，整体模型适配对严重领域偏移下实现鲁棒提示分割很重要。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

Motivation: 现实环境中恶劣天气会严重降低模型性能和可靠性，需要提升鲁棒多任务学习在恶劣环境下的性能。

Method: 引入RobuMTL架构，以混合专家的方式根据输入扰动动态选择特定任务的分层低秩自适应（LoRA）模块和LoRA专家组。

Result: 在PASCAL基准上，单扰动下相对MTL基线平均提升2.8%，混合天气条件下提升达44.4%；在NYUD - v2上任务平均提升9.7%。

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

Motivation: 解决Solafune树冠检测竞赛中小而不平衡数据集训练深度模型易过拟合问题，评估架构在极端数据稀缺下用于树冠分割的适用性。

Method: 评估YOLOv11、Mask R - CNN、DeepLabv3、Swin - UNet和DINOv2五种架构。

Result: 基于卷积的预训练模型（如YOLOv11和Mask R - CNN）泛化能力明显优于基于Transformer的预训练模型，DeeplabV3、Swin - UNet和DINOv2表现不佳。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在低数据情况下若无大量预训练或增强则表现不佳，语义和实例分割差异影响性能，轻量级CNN方法对有限图像的树冠检测最可靠。

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

Motivation: 传统医疗诊断AI研究聚焦图像分析，缺乏患者症状报告影响诊断准确性。

Method: 提出PCDF，模拟两个视觉语言模型间的诊断对话，用临床验证合成症状，用对话交互微调DocVLM。

Result: DocVLM - PatientVLM交互形成连贯多轮咨询，临床验证合成症状有相关性、覆盖性和真实性。

Conclusion: 基于对话的监督比仅图像训练有显著提升，凸显真实症状获取对诊断的价值。

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注特定类型干扰物，需要一种能去除多种 3D 场景干扰物的统一方法。

Method: 在 Instant - NPG 上直接操作，结合隐式 3D 表示和 2D 探测器；设计 LPIPS 损失和 MVCL 损失联合优化 IDDR - NGP 渲染结果；训练端到端；构建含合成和真实干扰物的新基准数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明 IDDR - NGP 在去除多种类型干扰物方面有效且鲁棒；结果与现有 SOTA 除雪方法相当，能准确去除真实和合成干扰物。

Conclusion: IDDR - NGP 作为首个统一干扰物去除方法，能有效且鲁棒地去除多种 3D 场景干扰物。

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Method: 提出AIGVDBench基准，涵盖31个先进生成模型和超44万视频，对33个现有检测器进行超1500次评估。

Result: 从多视角进行8次深入分析，得出4个新发现。

Conclusion: 该工作为AI生成视频检测领域发展提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: 提出VIGA通过闭环程序进行场景重建和编辑，任务和模型无关，在多个基准测试中提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs缺乏细粒度空间和物理基础能力，无法一次性实现图像重建为可编辑图形程序的目标。

Method: 提出VIGA，采用闭环write - run - render - compare - revise程序，结合技能库和上下文记忆进行长期推理。

Result: VIGA在BlenderGym、SlideBench和BlenderBench等基准测试中大幅提升了单步基线。

Conclusion: VIGA能有效解决现有VLMs的问题，可在多种任务中应用，并可评估异构基础VLMs。

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

Result: 在34个模拟基准和5个真实任务中，X - Distill方法优于使用从头开始的ResNet或微调后的DINOv2编码器的策略，也超过3D编码器和更大的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 简单、合理的蒸馏策略可在数据高效的机器人操作中达到先进水平。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在稀疏点标注下效果差，基础模型无法处理时间信息，需新方法进行准确的湿地绘图。

Method: 提出基于SAM的WetSAM框架，通过双分支设计整合卫星图像时间序列进行湿地绘图，有时间提示分支和空间分支，并采用双向一致性正则化联合优化。

Result: 在八个全球区域实验中，WetSAM显著优于现有方法，平均F1分数达85.58%，能以最少标注工作量实现准确且结构一致的湿地分割。

Conclusion: WetSAM具有强泛化能力，有潜力进行可扩展、低成本、高分辨率的湿地绘图。

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

Conclusion: 数值实验表明该方法能在分割图像结构中明确嵌入宽度特征的同时保持拓扑保真度。

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

Conclusion: 所提出的架构可有效分离多路免疫组化RGB全切片图像中单个染色剂的贡献。

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Conclusion: Map2Thought框架有效，能实现可解释3D理解并在少监督下表现良好。

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show ho

Motivation: 现有VLMs在推理时KV缓存增长带来内存和计算瓶颈，将VLMs适配到MLA架构且避免昂贵预训练的方法待探索。

Method: 提出MHA2MLA - VLM框架，包含模态自适应部分RoPE策略、模态解耦低秩近似方法；引入参数高效微调，最小化输出激活误差。

Result: 在三个代表性VLMs上实验表明，MHA2MLA - VLM用最少监督数据恢复原有模型性能，显著减少KV缓存占用，可与KV量化无缝集成。

Conclusion: MHA2MLA - VLM是一种参数高效、多模态感知的框架，能有效将现成VLMs转换为MLA，解决相关问题。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Motivation: 现有的3D形状生成方法大多依赖干净、无遮挡和分割良好的输入，在现实场景中难以满足，需要新方法处理随意拍摄的数据。

Method: 利用现成的视觉惯性SLAM、3D检测算法和视觉语言模型提取信息，训练整流流变压器生成3D形状，采用多种技术确保对随意拍摄数据的鲁棒性，还引入新的评估基准。

Result: ShapeR在具有挑战性的场景中显著优于现有方法，在Chamfer距离上比现有技术提高2.7倍。

Conclusion: ShapeR是一种有效的从随意拍摄序列进行条件3D对象形状生成的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

Conclusion: 所提出的信道感知训练算法能够解决边缘推理中训练与部署环境不匹配的问题，提升推理性能。

Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.

We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.

Result: 第一主成分解释40.6%属性方差，保留四个成分且结构稳定；全属性综合模型预测专家整体评级远优于单因素总结。

Conclusion: 绩效评估有适度信息压缩，结合共享方差与稳定残差维度，对测量系统设计有直接启示。

Abstract: How do evaluation systems compress multidimensional performance information into summary ratings? Using expert assessments of 9,669 professional soccer players on 28 attributes, we characterize the dimensional structure of evaluation outputs. The first principal component explains 40.6% of attribute variance, indicating a strong general factor, but formal noise discrimination procedures retain four components and bootstrap resampling confirms that this structure is highly stable. Internal consistency is high without evidence of redundancy. In out of sample prediction of expert overall ratings, a comprehensive model using the full attribute set substantially outperforms a single-factor summary (cross-validated R squared = 0.814). Overall, performance evaluations exhibit moderate information compression; they combine shared variance with stable residual dimensions that are economically meaningful for evaluation outcomes, with direct implications for the design of measurement systems.

Method: 结合简单宏观核算框架与AI生产流程的典型描述。

Result: 数据中心是AI生态系统支柱且2025年吸引大量投资；今年前三季度IT和AI相关资本支出大幅推动总需求，但考虑AI硬件高进口含量后对GDP增长贡献较小；新AI数据中心服务产出对GDP贡献未来或与当前投资规模相当。

Conclusion: 短期内再投资周期和未来AI需求不确定性未构成宏观经济拖累，但中期可能引发宏观经济风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has moved to the center of policy, market, and academic debates, but its macroeconomic footprint is still only partly understood. This paper provides an overview on how the current AI wave is captured in US national accounts, combining a simple macro-accounting framework with a stylized description of the AI production process. We highlight the crucial role played by data centers, which constitute the backbone of the AI ecosystem and have attracted formidable investment in 2025, as they are indispensable for meeting the rapidly increasing worldwide demand for AI services. We document that the boom in IT and AI-related capital expenditure in the first three quarters of the year has given an outsized boost to aggregate demand, while its contribution to GDP growth is smaller once the high import content of AI hardware is netted out. Furthermore, simple calculations suggest that, at current utilization rates and pricing, the production of services originating in new AI data centers could contribute to GDP over the turn of the next quarters on a scale comparable to that of investment spending to date. Short reinvestment cycles and uncertainty about future AI demand, while not currently acting as a macroeconomic drag, can nevertheless fuel macroeconomic risks over the medium term.

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的微调方法能够减轻OOD效应并提高估计精度。

Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: 通过全局约束最小作用原理，该概率公式在不可逆动力学中有良好表现。

Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.

Method: 将上下文学习与熵引导的思维链推理和自适应上下文检索相结合，根据标记级不确定性动态调整检索示例数量和推理路径。

Result: 与次优算法对手实验，熵感知自适应推理显著提高决策质量，平均游戏结果从基线LLM的-11.6%提升到9.5%，且每场游戏的LLM查询次数相对较少，统计验证改进显著，相关性分析显示标记级熵与移动最优性负相关。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的自适应推理能有效提升LLM在序贯决策环境中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

Result: 在核心推荐基准测试中，EncodeRec作为顺序推荐模型骨干和语义ID标记化都有效，比基于PLM和嵌入模型的基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 嵌入适配在通用语言模型和实用推荐系统间起关键作用。

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

Conclusion: 建议从较小的开源模型开始，构建有限的基准来验证整个计算流程的有效性。

Abstract: Currently, there are thousands of large pretrained language models (LLMs) available to social scientists. How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

Conclusion: 统计基础的对数导向可实现大的、一致的、多任务控制增益，具有广泛适用性和任务无关性。

Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.

Result: 在多个大语言模型骨干和个性化方法的实验中，FPPS显著提高了事实准确性，同时保持了个性化性能。

Conclusion: FPPS能有效减轻个性化导致的事实扭曲，同时保留个性化行为。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) adapt model behavior to individual users to enhance user satisfaction, yet personalization can inadvertently distort factual reasoning. We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

TL;DR: 本文对顺序知识编辑进行谱分析，提出REVIVE框架稳定顺序编辑，实验表明其能提升编辑效果并保留模型通用能力。

Motivation: 顺序知识编辑常导致模型通用能力崩溃，现有方法缓解效果不佳且对退化机制理解不足。

Method: 对顺序知识编辑进行谱分析，发现模型通用能力与预训练权重矩阵的主导奇异方向有关，提出REVIVE框架，在原始权重的谱基中表示参数更新并过滤干扰分量。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试上的实验表明，REVIVE在长序列编辑中能持续提高编辑效果并大幅保留通用能力，甚至在多达20000次编辑的极端设置下也有效。

Conclusion: REVIVE是一个有效的、即插即用的框架，可稳定顺序知识编辑，同时保留模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type. Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.

Conclusion: 思维的社会组织能有效探索解空间，推理模型与人类集体智能有计算上的相似性，为智能体组织带来新机遇。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines. We release our code at https://ibm.biz/factcorrector.

Motivation: 大语言模型存在可靠性问题，现有KG增强大语言模型有认知僵化问题，易受噪声和结构不对齐影响导致推理停滞。

Method: 提出CoG框架，包含作为快速直觉过程的关系蓝图引导模块和作为审慎分析过程的失败感知细化模块。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CoG在准确性和效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoG能有效解决KG增强大语言模型的可靠性问题，提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 开发临床医生回复主题元素分类法和评估框架，发布专家标注数据集，对本地和商用LLMs采用主题提示、检索增强生成等多种适应技术进行大规模评估。

Result: LLMs草稿与临床医生回复对齐存在显著认知不确定性，虽能撰写部分主题元素，但在其他主题，尤其询问患者信息方面有困难，主题驱动策略多数有改进。

Conclusion: 必须使LLMs适应用户医生偏好，以实现其在医患沟通工作流程中的可靠和负责任使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

Conclusion: 提出评估框架，分析了大语言模型在招聘中的决策逻辑及与人类决策的差异。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in recruitment applications, where decisions require reasoning over unstructured text, balancing multiple criteria, and inferring fit and competence from indirect productivity signals. Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

Result: 综合实验表明RT - RAG在F1指标上比现有方法高7.0%，EM指标高6.0%。

Conclusion: RT - RAG在复杂多跳问答中是有效的。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

Result: 发现关系线性与幻觉率有强相关性（r∈[.78,.82]）。

Conclusion: 关系三元组的底层存储是影响模型自我评估知识能力的因素，对管理幻觉行为和改进事实知识表示有指导意义。

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

Conclusion: HORSE方法有效，代码开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 使用LRM解释获取新见解时需谨慎，并给出表征LRM解释泛化性的框架。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

Abstract: Maronna's and Tyler's $M$-estimators are among the most widely used robust estimators for scatter matrices. However, when the dimension of observations is relatively high, their performance can substantially deteriorate in certain situations, particularly in the presence of clustered outliers. To address this issue, we propose an estimator that shrinks the estimated precision matrix toward the identity matrix. We derive a sufficient condition for its existence, discuss its statistical interpretation, and establish upper and lower bounds for its breakdown point. Numerical experiments confirm robustness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.

Conclusion: EvidFuse能有效解决现有系统的局限性，实现文本 - 图表交错生成。

Abstract: Data-driven reports communicate decision-relevant insights by tightly interleaving narrative text with charts grounded in underlying tables. However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space. Experiments demonstrate that EvidFuse attains the top rank in both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations on chart quality, chart-text alignment, and report-level usefulness.
