In this paper we show that it is possible to use an\nimage-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of\nprime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted\nfrom regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on\nblocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This\nimplies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in\nthe latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem\nto imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in\ndifferent regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at\nlower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers.

The Reuse Distance Histogram (RDH) is\na widely used metric to quantify temporal locality, measuring the distance\nbetween consecutive accesses to the same memory location. Traditionally,\ncalculating RDH requires program execution and memory trace collection to\nobtain dynamic memory access behavior. This trace collection is often\ntime-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for early-stage optimization\nor large-scale applications. Static prediction, on the other hand, offers a\nsignificant speedup in estimating RDH and cache hit rates. However, these\napproaches lack accuracy, since the predictions come without running the\nprogram and knowing the complete memory access pattern, more specifically when\narrays are used inside nested loops. This paper presents a novel static\nanalysis framework for predicting the reuse profiles of array references in\nprograms with nested loop structures, without requiring any runtime\ninformation. By analyzing loop bounds, access patterns in smaller problem\nsizes, and predictive equations, our method predicts access patterns of arrays\nand estimates reuse distances and cache hit rate at compile time. This paper\nextends our previous study by incorporating more analysis and improving\nprediction by addressing previously unhandled reuse patterns. We evaluate our\ntechnique against a widely accepted traditional trace-driven profiling tool,\nParallel Reuse Distance Analysis (PARDA). The results demonstrate that our\nstatic predictor achieves comparable accuracy while offering\norders-of-magnitude improvement in the analysis speed. This work offers a\npractical alternative to dynamic reuse profiling and paves the way for\nintegration into compilers and static performance modeling tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u9884\u6d4b\u5d4c\u5957\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u6570\u7ec4\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\uff08RDH\uff09\u9700\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5faa\u73af\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u7ec4\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u7eb3\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u5904\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177PARDA\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5206\u6790\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7528\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

This problem is\nmotivated by a program scheduling in commercial broadcast channels with\nconstraints on content repetition and placement, which leads precisely to the\nDPED problem for paths.\n  In this paper, we study DPED on paths and present a polynomial time exact\nalgorithm when precolored vertices are restricted to the two ends of the path\nand devise an approximation algorithm for DPED with an additive approximation\nfactor polynomially bounded by $d$ and the number of precolored vertices. Then,\nwe prove that the Distance Precoloring Extension problem on paths, a less\nrestrictive version of DPED without the demand constraints, and then DPED\nitself, is NP-complete. Motivated by this result, we further study the\nparameterized complexity of DPED on paths. We establish that the DPED problem\non paths is $W[1]$-hard when parameterized by the number of colors and the\ndistance. On the positive side, we devise a fixed parameter tractable (FPT)\nalgorithm for DPED on paths when the number of colors, the distance, and the\nnumber of precolored vertices are considered as the parameters.

An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:\nFoam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,\nincluding advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of\nhandling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic\ngeneration of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via\nParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,\nthe framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as\ndiscrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other\nagentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.\nHigh-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a\nHierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a\ndependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%\nsuccess rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing\nframeworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the\nexpertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems\ncan democratize complex scientific computing.

We outline technical directions\nfor advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,\nmodel-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support\nsystems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE\nrealisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only\ngenerate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a\nclinically meaningful way.

BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the\nentire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential\nEquation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while\nlearning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain\nthe bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while\nrecent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain\nconstraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias\nhelps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by\nusing a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1)\n(autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done\non varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step\nforecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured\nregimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon,\ninventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96\nto 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the\nflexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data\nshrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains\nstable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance:\nenforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax\nstructure when extreme events dominate.

The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian\ninference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features\nfrom monitoring data.

Unlike traditional settings that assume\nthe Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), interference allows an\nintervention/treatment on one unit to affect the outcomes of others.\nUnderstanding both direct and spillover effects is critical in fields such as\nepidemiology, political science, and economics. Causal inference on networks\nfaces two main challenges. First, causal effects are typically heterogeneous,\nvarying with unit features and local network structure. Second, connected units\noften exhibit dependence due to network homophily, creating confounding between\nstructural correlations and causal effects. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage method to estimate heterogeneous direct and spillover effects on\nnetworks. The first stage uses graph neural networks to estimate nuisance\ncomponents that depend on the complex network topology.

Our approach balances\nexpressiveness and interpretability, enabling downstream tasks such as\nidentifying influential neighborhoods and recovering the sign of spillover\neffects.

Approximation algorithms on the other hand have received little\nattention in electoral control, despite their prevalence in the study of other\nforms of electoral attacks, such as manipulation and bribery. Early work\nestablished some preliminary results with respect to popular voting rules such\nas plurality, approval, and Condorcet. In this paper, we establish for each of\nthe ``standard'' control problems under plurality, approval, and Condorcet,\nwhether they are approximable, and we prove our results in both the weighted\nand unweighted voter settings. For each problem we study under either approval\nor Condorcet, we show that any approximation algorithm we give is optimal,\nunless P=NP. Our approximation algorithms leverage the fact that Covering\nInteger Programs (CIPs) can be approximated within a factor of $O(\\log n)$.\nUnder plurality, we give an $O(m)$-approximation algorithm, and give as lower\nbound $\\Omega(m^{1/4})$, by using a known lower bound on the Minimum $k$-Union\n(M$k$U) problem.

Its adaptability makes\nit more suitable for analyzing real-world graphs where noise and imperfect data\nare common and the ideal clique model is often impractical. The problem of\nidentifying the maximum $ k $-plex (MKP, which is NP-hard) is gaining attention\nin fields such as social network analysis, community detection, terrorist\nnetwork identification, and graph clustering. Recent works have focused on\noptimizing the time complexity of MKP algorithms. The state-of-the-art has\nreduced the complexity from a trivial $ O^*(2^n) $ to $ O^*(c_k^n) $, with $\nc_k > 1.94 $ for $ k \\geq 3 $, where $ n $ denotes the vertex number. This\npaper investigates the MKP using two quantum models: gate-based model and\nannealing-based model. Two gate-based algorithms, qTKP and qMKP, are proposed\nto achieve $ O^*(1.42^n) $ time complexity. qTKP integrates quantum search with\ngraph encoding, degree counting, degree comparison, and size determination to\nfind a $ k $-plex of a given size; qMKP uses binary search to progressively\nidentify the maximum solution. Furthermore, by reformulating MKP as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, we propose qaMKP, the first\nannealing-based approximation algorithm, which utilizes qubit resources more\nefficiently than gate-based algorithms. To validate the practical performance,\nproof-of-principle experiments were conducted using the latest IBM gate-based\nquantum simulator and D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer.

The\nreliance on static peak memory estimates exacerbates fragmentation,\nunderutilization, and job rejections. We propose Scheduler-Driven Job\nAtomization (SJA), a new paradigm that establishes a bidirectional interaction\nbetween scheduler and jobs. In SJA, the scheduler advertises available\nexecution gaps, and jobs respond by signaling interest if they can potentially\ngenerate a subjob that fits the offered time-capacity window. The scheduler may\ncollect multiple signals for the same slot and, based on its allocation policy\n(e.g., fairness, efficiency, or SLA priorities), selects which job is granted\nthe slot. Only then does the chosen job materialize a safe, self-contained\nsubjob tailored to that opportunity. Unlike migration or preemption, SJA\nproactively shapes workloads before execution, thereby avoiding costly state\ntransfers and unpredictable interruptions. It aims to increase GPU utilization,\nreduce wait times, and minimize migration overhead by aligning jobs with\nopportunities in real time, ensuring that each admitted subjob is correct by\nconstruction.

It further\nreviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes\nkey open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented\nresearch progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.\nFinally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role\nof LLMs in OR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u878d\u5165\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\uff08OR\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0cLLMs\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLMs\u878d\u5165OR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6c42\u89e3\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u63a8\u8fdbLLMs\u5728OR\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the\npossibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper\ninvestigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness\nand on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound,\nas they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable\nagent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may\nlead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail\nmechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution\nof each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs\nin test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose\na definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case\nexecution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six\nSigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging\nfrom 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current\nlimitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing.

Existing models\nfor predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive\naccuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are\nfurther challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise\nonly a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to\ntheory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final\nclassifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their\ninteraction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode\nchoice.

By mapping these patterns\nto canonical architectural components of agent frameworks and agentic\napplications, we uncover a fundamental inversion of testing effort:\ndeterministic components like Resource Artifacts (tools) and Coordination\nArtifacts (workflows) consume over 70% of testing effort, while the FM-based\nPlan Body receives less than 5%.

We further benchmark the retrieval performances\nacross multiple state-of-the-art audio fingerprinting frameworks by augmenting\nreal reference databases with synthetic distractors, and show that the scaling\ntrends obtained with synthetic distractors closely track those obtained with\nreal distractors.

However, due to the high cost of RCTs, the\nproportion of trial data relative to observational data is small, which only\naccounts for 0.65\\% of total traffic in our context, resulting in significant\nbias when generalizing to the broader user base. Additionally, the complexity\nof industrial processes reduces the quality of RCT data, which is often subject\nto heterogeneity from potential interference and selection bias, making it\ndifficult to correct. Moreover, existing data fusion methods are challenging to\nimplement effectively in complex industrial settings due to the high\ndimensionality of features and the strict assumptions that are hard to verify\nwith real-world data. To address these issues, we propose an empirical data\nfusion method called pseudo-sample matching.

This paper introduces\nSimilarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the\nprinciples governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We\ndefine: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of\nentities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed\nrelational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the\nevolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by\n$p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers\n$F_{\\alpha}(K) = { E \\in U \\mid S(E,K) \\ge \\alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of\nthe unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that\nproduces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative\ndefinition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a\nconcept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of\n$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field\nTheory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and\nconstructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks\nmutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or\neventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the\nevolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,\nculminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large\nlanguage models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u76f8\u4f3c\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u503c\u539f\u7406\u53ca\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u8bfb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6301\u4e45\u548c\u8f6c\u53d8\u76f8\u4f3c\u5173\u7cfb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u523b\u753b\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u573a\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7ed9\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u963b\u788d\u76f8\u4e92\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9700\u8981\u951a\u5750\u6807\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u9650\u5236\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u5185\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4f3c\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u523b\u753b\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u8bfb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002"}}

ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from\nsuccessful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to\ncalibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from\nthe success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and\nMATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\\times$ speedup over iterative\nmethods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nSelf-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\\% improvement in\nefficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent\noptimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning\ntechniques viable for production deployment.

Code is available at GitHub\n  https://github.com/ShanechiLab/PGPCA.git", "summary": "Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science\nincluding neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a\nprominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic\napproach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection\nbetween PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its\nextensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in\na Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data\nmay be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than\nlying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal\nComponent Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction\nalgorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear\nmanifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition\nto the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be\nderived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold\nand noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA\nmodel parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data\ndistributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry.

To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures\nin combinatorial optimization.

However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily\nfocus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training\nprocess and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters.

However,\nexisting continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter\nisolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks\ndegrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and\nweakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial\nmixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual\ninstruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated\nLoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter\nindependence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable\ncross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the\nshared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The\ndiscriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned\ninformation during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the\nshared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the\ndiscriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing\nknowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting\nself-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an\nindustrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for\ncontinual instruction tuning.

As such, new\nrule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible\njustification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The\nprimary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both\nrule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE\nperforms against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to\nmulti-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can\ngenerate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose\nupwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with\nXGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The\nresearch used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,\nand processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that\nFOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering\nfewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in\nprocessing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE\nis more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to\ngenerating a comprehensible rule set.

Needing assumptions on latent\nstructures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works\noften build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.\nHowever, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external\nto the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can\nbe easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating\nidentification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources\nbeing auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables.

Quantization achieves\ncompression by limiting the number of representable points in the data.\nTherefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal\ncombination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing\nPTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest\n(RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods.

This challenge is particularly\ncritical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and\ndetailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has\nadvanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal\nspatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational\nOrientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese\nconversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing\negocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed\nscenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which\nintegrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a\nstructured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)\nmapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.\nA curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on\nTaiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of\nresource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%\norientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,\nsubstantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines.

Successive generations, including GPT-o\nseries, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale\nRL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most\nof these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation\nand training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains\ncomputationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%\nof total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the\nlong-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy\nresponses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model\nand rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits\nscalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in\nReinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the\nrollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the\ntarget number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for\ncontinuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are\ndiscarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time.

This\npaper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using\nexperts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained\nmodels (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact\nthat these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter\nspace, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation.

However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require\nretraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.\nThere also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated\ndata and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream\ntasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces\nleads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we\npropose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the\nDS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed\nto avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based\nhierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,\nthe generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they\noriginate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets\nto validate our approach.

In this paper,\nguided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \\textbf{Lo}w-\\textbf{R}ank\n\\textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only\nrelaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering\nresults. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between\northogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By\nintegrating \\textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the\nmaximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \\textbf{B-LoRD}, which further\nenhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we\ntransform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex\nconstraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter.

However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers\nfrom a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either\nentirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these\nhomogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously\nincorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,\nleading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To\novercome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy\nOptimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust\nlearning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism\nhypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage\ncalculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group\nand ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no\nlonger zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the\nupdate magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on\nthat of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure\nintroduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B\ndemonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,\nDAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and\nAIME2025.

In many\nreal-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only\nthe test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual\nloss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel\nfidelity.

These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters.

Results show that probabilistic planners outperform\nthe rule-based baseline, achieving up to 97.5 percent collision-free navigation\nunder partial observability, with POMCP prioritizing safety and DESPOT\nbalancing efficiency and runtime feasibility.

First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where\nFSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed\nbranches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed\nbranches bias subsequent reasoning.

Unlike prior\nmethods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study\nintroduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt\nscheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling\nstrategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different\ntasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across\ntasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating\nmechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between\nprompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible\nsharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective\ncenters on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning\nstrategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference\nand negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of\nsensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact\nof prompt temperature parameters and task number variation.

They cannot process\nfree-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly\ninteraction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot\nadaptability. Although text-query-based separation methods have been explored,\nthey primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that\nrequire precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and\ndiverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an\nopen-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained\naudio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-decoder\ncomposition and an adaptive fusion strategy to enable effective continuous\ntraining from pretrained weights.

For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks\nrecover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization.\nOur results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage,\nhighlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a\nbenchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u533f\u540d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56EER\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51faVoxGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eEER\u4f4e\u4f30\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u7528VoxGuard\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u97f3\u533f\u540d\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56EER\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u624b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u7684VoxGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u4e24\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u77e5\u60c5\u5bf9\u624b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6062\u590d\u5c5e\u6027\u3002EER\u5927\u5e45\u4f4e\u4f30\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8350VoxGuard\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

This paper\nproposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM\nand a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the\nset of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a\nconfidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier\ndirectly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies\nhigh-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual\nrepresentations.

Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this\nlimitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in\nsimulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative\nmodels have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with\ndiffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the\nquestion of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance\npre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose\nWorld4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as\nhigh-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined\nenvironments for robotic manipulation.

We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme\ntailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve\nmodeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate\nthat World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables\nconsistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates\ncompared to imitation learning and other baselines.

AI was useful and used, however, in\nproducing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in\nevading human and algorithmic detection.

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this\nknowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of\ntwo key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse\nweather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from\nclean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under\nadverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

In this paper, we\nexamine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to\nsolve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation\nlies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role\nin ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the\nproblem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine\nlearning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter.\nSpecifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict\nsuitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input\ngraph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the\npenalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem\ninstance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of\nminimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions.

However, two key challenges\npersist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often\noccluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal\nbehavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a\nMulti-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage\naccident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for\nmulti-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale\nfeature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a\nMulti-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,\nmid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture\nis leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature\nprocessing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under\ncausal constraints.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

We announce the first public release\nof CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and\nSchreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles\nmuch larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.\n  Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier\ngraphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric\ngroups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of\nquadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is\na general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem\nbeing NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on\ndiameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to\nprevious O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to\ninvolutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the\ndiameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an\nanswer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs\ngenerated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.\n  For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results\non upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of\ndiameter on p. Moreover.\n  Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems\nverifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created\nmore than 10 Kaggle datasets.

We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement.
