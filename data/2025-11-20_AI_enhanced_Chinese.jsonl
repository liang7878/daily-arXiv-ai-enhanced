Bimanual psychomotor proficiency is fundamental to neurosurgical procedures, yet it remains difficult for trainees to acquire and for educators to objectively evaluate performance. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a neurosurgical simulation platform that integrates an anatomically realistic brain model with surgical instrument tracking to support training and objective assessment of bimanual tasks in the context of subpial corticectomy. Methods. We developed and evaluated a neurosurgical simulation platform based on an ex-vivo calf brain model and a multi-camera tracking system capable of simultaneously capturing the motion of surgical instruments in both hands, including collection of real-time instrument trajectories and synchronized video recordings. These enabled extraction of motion-based, time-based, and bimanual coordination metrics. We conducted a case series involving 47 participants across four training levels: medical students, junior residents, senior residents, and neurosurgeons. Results. The tracking system successfully captured instrument motion during 81% of the periods when instruments were actively used throughout the simulation procedure. Several extracted metrics were able to significantly differentiate between levels of surgical expertise. In particular, instrument usage duration and custom-defined bimanual coordination metrics such as instrument tip separation distance and simultaneous usage time, show potential as features to identify participant expertise levels with different instruments. Conclusions. We demonstrated the feasibility of tracking surgical instruments during complex bimanual tasks in an ex-vivo brain simulation platform. The metrics developed provide a foundation for objective performance assessment and highlight the potential of motion analysis to improve neurosurgical training and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u76ae\u5c42\u4e0b\u5207\u9664\u672f\u53cc\u624b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u624b\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u5458\u96be\u638c\u63e1\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u96be\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u4f53\u5c0f\u725b\u8111\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5b9e\u65f6\u5668\u68b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf947\u540d\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c34\u5e73\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u572881%\u5668\u68b0\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6bb5\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u533a\u5206\u624b\u672f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u79bb\u4f53\u8111\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u590d\u6742\u53cc\u624b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon.

In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.\n  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).\n  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs.

Despite recent advances in LLMs for Text2SQL code generation, existing approaches focus primarily on SELECT queries, neglecting the challenges of SQL update operations and their ripple effects. Traditional CASCADE UPDATE constraints are static and unsuitable for modern, denormalized databases, which demand dynamic, context-aware updates. Castle enables natural language instructions to trigger multi-column, causally consistent SQL UPDATE statements, without revealing table content to the model. By framing UPDATE SQL generation as a divide-and-conquer task with LLMs' reasoning capacity, Castle can determine not only which columns must be directly updated, but also how those updates propagate through the schema, causing cascading updates -- all via nested queries and substructures that ensure data confidentiality.

Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence.

We present a novel reservoir computing framework that combines delay embedding with random Fourier feature (RFF) mappings to capture such dynamics. Two formulations are investigated: a single-scale RFF reservoir, which employs a fixed kernel bandwidth, and a multi-scale RFF reservoir, which integrates multiple bandwidths to represent both fast and slow temporal dependencies. The framework is applied to a diverse set of canonical systems: neuronal models such as the Rulkov map, Izhikevich model, Hindmarsh-Rose model, and Morris-Lecar model, which exhibit spiking, bursting, and chaotic behaviors arising from fast-slow interactions; and ecological models including the predator-prey dynamics and Ricker map with seasonal forcing, which display multi-scale oscillations and intermittency. Across all cases, the multi-scale RFF reservoir consistently outperforms its single-scale counterpart, achieving lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and more robust long-horizon predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly incorporating multi-scale feature mappings into reservoir computing architectures for modeling complex dynamical systems with intrinsic fast-slow interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6RFF\u50a8\u5c42\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\uff08RFF\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6RFF\u50a8\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6RFF\u50a8\u5c42\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u7eb3\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u5feb\u6162\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Static post-training quantization reduces storage costs but cannot adapt to shifting activation patterns, causing accuracy loss under aggressive compression. So we present DynaExq, a runtime system that treats expert precision as a first-class, dynamically managed resource. DynaExq combines (1) a hotness-aware precision controller that continuously aligns expert bit-widths with long-term activation statistics, (2) a fully asynchronous precision-switching pipeline that overlaps promotion and demotion with MoE computation, and (3) a fragmentation-free memory pooling mechanism that supports hybrid-precision experts with deterministic allocation. Together, these components enable stable, non-blocking precision transitions under strict HBM budgets.\n  Across Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-80B MoE models and six representative benchmarks, DynaExq deploys large LLMs on single RTX 5090 and A6000 GPUs and improves accuracy by up to 4.03 points over static low-precision baselines.

We refine this picture: for each layer $\\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $\u0394^\\ell \\subset \u0398$ and injective stratum $U^\\ell = \u0398\\setminus \u0394^\\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\\ell_\u03b8$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $\u0398/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.\n  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training.

Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters. By leveraging the robustness of MoM alongside the stability of convex clustering, our method enhances both performance and efficiency, especially on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates weak consistency under specific conditions, while experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u51f8\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5747\u503c\uff08MoM\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u7c07\u6570\u91cf\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u7c07\u6570\u91cf\u4e14\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u51f8\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f3a\u878d\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u6709\u6548\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u51f8\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5747\u503c\uff08MoM\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86MoM\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51f8\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

In the EpiGNN, through its transmission risk encoding module and Region-Aware Graph Learner (RAGL), both multi-scale convolutions and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are combined, aiming to effectively capture spatio-temporal propagation dynamics between regions and support the integration of external resources to enhance forecasting performance. While, in the ColaGNN, a cross-location attention mechanism, multi-scale dilated convolutions, and graph message passing are utilized to address the challenges of long-term forecasting through dynamic graph structures and spatio-temporal feature fusion. Both enjoy respective advantages but also share mutual shortcomings. Our EpiHybridGNN is therefore designed to combine the advantages of both EpiGNN, in its risk encoding and RAGL, and ColaGNN, in its long-term forecasting capabilities and dynamic attention mechanisms. This helps to form a more comprehensive and robust prediction of spatio-temporal epidemic propagation.

Inspired by recent advances in scenario optimization (Garatti and Campi, 2025), we obtain robustness results for key equilibria with nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs, overcoming the dependence on the non-degeneracy assumption.

To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy.

We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we explore designing a systematic and generalizable knowledge transfer policy through Reinforcement Learning. We first identify three major challenges: determining the task to transfer (where), the knowledge to be transferred (what) and the mechanism for the transfer (how). To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained.

Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks.

Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $\u03b7>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $\u03c1_k^\u03b7$ that approximate to first order in $\u03b7$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $\u03bb$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $\u03b7$. We show that $\u03c1_k^\u03b7$ are approximated to order $\u03b7^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \\emph{modified} energy \\[ J^\u03b7(\u03c1) = J(\u03c1) - \\frac\u03b7{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{\u03b4J}{\u03b4\u03c1} (\u03c1) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,\u03c1(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $\u03b7/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $\u03b7$ a \\textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{\u00e4}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^\u03b7$ we study \\emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^\u03b7$, in several simple numerical examples.

Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm.

Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.\n  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support.

Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).

The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts.

This paper introduces a fundamentally different approximation paradigm that reverses this quantifier order. For each target function $f$, we construct a single recurrent neural network (RNN) with fixed topology and fixed weights that approximates $f$ to within any prescribed tolerance $\u03b5> 0$ when run for sufficiently many time steps.\n  The key mechanism enabling this quantifier reversal is temporal computation combined with weight sharing: rather than increasing network depth, the approximation error is reduced solely by running the RNN longer. This yields exponentially decaying approximation error as a function of runtime while requiring storage of only a small, fixed set of weights. Such architectures are appealing for hardware implementations where memory is scarce and runtime is comparatively inexpensive.\n  To initiate the systematic development of this novel approximation paradigm, we focus on univariate polynomials. Our RNN constructions emulate the structural calculus underlying deep feed-forward ReLU network approximation theory -- parallelization, linear combinations, affine transformations, and, most importantly, a clocked mechanism that realizes function composition within a single recurrent architecture.

However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution.

To do so, we identify greenwashing content in 11 million social-political ads in Meta's Ad Targeting Datset with a measurement technique that combines large language models, human coders, and advances in Bayesian item response theory. We show that what is called greenwashing has diverse actors and components, but we also identify a very pernicious form, which we call political greenwashing, that appears to be promoted by fossil fuel companies and related interest groups. Based on ad targeting data, we show that much of this advertising happens via organizations with undisclosed links to the fossil fuel industry.

This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros.

Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ecf\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u50f5\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5957\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Traditionally, the weight vector is given, or a value oracle allows evaluating $w(S) := \\langle w, \\mathbbm{1}_S \\rangle$. Motivated by practical interest in pairwise comparisons, and by the theoretical quest to understand computational models, we study a weaker, more robust comparison oracle that for any $S, T \\in \\mathcal{F}$ reveals only whether $w(S) <, =, > w(T)$. We ask: when can we find $S^*$ using few comparison queries, and when can this be done efficiently?\n  We present three contributions: (1) We establish that the query complexity over any set system $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq 2^U$ is $\\tilde O(n^2)$, using the inference dimension framework, highlighting a separation between information and computational complexity (runtime may still be exponential for NP-hard problems under ETH). (2) We introduce a Global Subspace Learning (GSL) framework for objective functions with discrete integer weights bounded by $B$, giving an algorithm to sort all feasible sets using $O(nB \\log(nB))$ queries, improving the $\\tilde O(n^2)$ bound when $B = o(n)$. For linear matroids, algebraic techniques yield efficient algorithms for problems including $k$-SUM, SUBSET-SUM, and $A{+}B$ sorting. (3) We give the first polynomial-time, low-query algorithms for classic combinatorial problems: minimum cuts, minimum weight spanning trees (and matroid bases), bipartite matching (and matroid intersection), and shortest $s$-$t$ paths.\n  Our work provides the first general query complexity bounds and efficient algorithms for this model, opening new directions for comparison-based optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations).

While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms.

We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations. On FUNSD, OTCR achieves 91.95% SER and 91.13% RE, while on XFUND (ZH), it reaches 91.09% SER and 94.20% RE, demonstrating competitive performance across datasets.

The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably.

While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.\n  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.\n  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8bc4\u5206\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed9\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4Direct\uff08AI\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u548cReverse\uff08AI\u5148\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u518d\u6839\u636e\u4fee\u6b63\u60c5\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u8303\u56f4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "Direct\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u901f\u76f4\u63a5\uff0cReverse\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u9700\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8CS\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards.

Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.\n  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf936\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u3001\u8de8\u7f51\u7edc\u6d4b\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u65ad19\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u90e8\u7f7215\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u722c\u866b\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u793e\u533a\u722c\u866b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fde\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u8bae\u63a8\u65ad\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8303\u56f4\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u91cf\u5316IPv4\u4e0eIPv6\u4f7f\u7528\u8d8b\u52bf\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5f39\u6027\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on rigid, manually designed components such as infill criteria and evolutionary strategies during the search process limits their flexibility across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Dual-Control Bi-Space Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (DB-SAEA), a Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) framework tailored for multi-objective problems. DB-SAEA learns a meta-policy that jointly regulates candidate generation and infill criterion selection, enabling dual control. The bi-space Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module in DB-SAEA adopts an attention-based architecture to capture optimization states from both true and surrogate evaluation spaces, while ensuring scalability across problem dimensions, population sizes, and objectives. Additionally, we integrate TabPFN as the surrogate model for accurate and efficient prediction with uncertainty estimation. The framework is trained via reinforcement learning, leveraging parallel sampling and centralized training to enhance efficiency and transferability across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that DB-SAEA not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, but also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks with higher-dimensional settings.

This paper demonstrates that when factor models are misspecified -- an almost certain reality -- traditional event study estimators produce inconsistent estimates of treatment effects. The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures. Revisiting four empirical applications, we show that some established findings may reflect model misspecification rather than true treatment effects.

We share the insights and lessons learned from deployment of the tool - in production since March 2024 - scaled across 70 software products, processing over 2000 tickets for issue diagnosis, achieving a time savings of 300+ man hours and an estimated $15,444 per month in manpower costs compared to the traditional log analysis practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdCPU\u8fd0\u884cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u4eab\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "IT\u73af\u5883\u65e5\u5fd7\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884cLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u81ea2024\u5e743\u6708\u6295\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u8986\u76d670\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8d852000\u5f20\u95ee\u9898\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5355\uff0c\u8282\u7701300\u591a\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u6708\u8282\u7701\u7ea615444\u7f8e\u5143\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products.

A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5171\u5f62\u5316\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u3001\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u5206\u6570\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u867d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u6392\u5e8f\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4e0d\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4ecd\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5171\u5f62\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5019\u9009\u5206\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u8f93\u56fe\u5b9a\u4e49\u5019\u9009\u8005\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u5728\u5206\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u5206\u533a\u4e0a\u662f\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u6574\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u5206\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Our method derives conditions for when subtrees can be pruned (or included wholesale), expressed in terms of the metadata available at each node. We efficiently generate these conditions using symbolic interval analysis, extended with new rules to handle geometric predicates (e.g., intersection, containment). Additionally, our compiler fuses compound queries (e.g., reductions on filters) into a single tree traversal. These techniques enable the automatic derivation of generalized single-index and dual-index tree joins that support a wide class of join predicates beyond standard equality and range predicates.

However, most systems are optimized solely for engagement metrics, such as click rate, viewing time, or scrolling, without accounting for users' emotional states. Repeated exposure to emotionally charged content has been shown to negatively affect users' emotional well-being over time. We propose an Emotion-aware Social Media Recommendation (ESMR) framework that personalizes content based on users' evolving emotional trajectories. ESMR integrates a Transformer-based emotion predictor with a hybrid recommendation policy: a LightGBM model for engagement during stable periods and a reinforcement learning agent with causally informed rewards when negative emotional states persist. Through behaviorally grounded evaluation over 30-day interaction traces, ESMR demonstrates improved emotional recovery, reduced volatility, and strong engagement retention.

Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.\n  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty.

Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u8865\u507f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u52a9\u529b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u6574\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u6d41\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6b64\u7c7b\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u80fd\u4f7f\u591a\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6307\u5bfc\u7f13\u6162\u6574\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability.

Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fatransformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3eVTOL\u98de\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901aDRL\u3002", "motivation": "eVTOL\u98de\u673a\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u5c0f\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u95ee\u9898\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u666e\u901aDRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fatransformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DRL\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4f7f\u7528transformer\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "result": "transformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DRL\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u8d77\u98de\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u662f\u666e\u901aDRL\u768425%\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u80fd\u8017\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97.2%\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u666e\u901aDRL\u768496.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684transformer\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684DRL\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901aDRL\u3002"}}

In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.\n  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\\log n)$ and $O(\\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).\n  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $\u0398(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies?

The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e2d\u6587\u5a74\u513f\u53d6\u540d\u8fd9\u4e00\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u521b\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faNAMeGEn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53e4\u5178\u8bd7\u8bcd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u516d\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u521b\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u521b\u610f\u548c\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAMeGEn\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u540d\u79f0\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u6784\u5efa17k+\u53e4\u5178\u8bd7\u8bcd\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6CBNames\u53ca\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "NAMeGEn\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u521b\u610f\u540d\u5b57\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMeGEn\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u5a74\u513f\u53d6\u540d\u8fd9\u4e00\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u521b\u610f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive \"space-ification\" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters.

Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.\n  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark.

LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible.

We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels.

However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.\n  Our method is implemented in the \\texttt{R} package \\texttt{heavylasso} available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6307\u6570Lasso\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178Lasso\u5bf9\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178Lasso\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u65b9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6307\u6570Lasso\uff0c\u5728Lasso\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u6307\u6570\u578b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528MM\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6307\u6570Lasso\u6709\u5f3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5728\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178Lasso\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u6570Lasso\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u6709\u754cn\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u8bcd\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u4e14\u65e0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u4e00\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u4e5fNP\u5b8c\u5168\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5206\u8bcdNP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u65e0\u754c\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u6709\u754c\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u5206\u8bcd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6709\u754cn\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u8bcd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5148\u8bf4\u660en\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\uff0c\u518d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e8c\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u8bcd\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u4e14\u65e0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u8bcd\u5728\u4e00\u5143\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u4e0aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982BPE\u548cUnigramLM\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u5206\u8bcd\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves.

SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model.\n  Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.\n  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.\n  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining.

A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as \"laissez-faire\" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation.

This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments.

Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks.

Because data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets.

The approach extends max-affine methods from convex shape-restricted regression to the more general Lipschitz setting. A key component is a nonlinear feature expansion that maps max-affine functions into a subclass of delta-convex functions, which act as universal approximators of Lipschitz functions while preserving their Lipschitz constants. Leveraging this property, the estimator attains the minimax convergence rate (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the intrinsic dimension of the data under squared loss and subgaussian distributions in the random design setting. The algorithm integrates adaptive partitioning to capture intrinsic dimension, a penalty-based regularization mechanism that removes the need to know the true Lipschitz constant, and a two-stage optimization procedure combining a convex initialization with local refinement. The framework is also straightforward to adapt to convex shape-restricted regression.

By leveraging prior estimates of proficiency to select questions and updating the estimates iteratively based on responses, CAT enables personalized learner modeling and has attracted substantial attention. Despite this progress, most existing works focus primarily on improving diagnostic accuracy, while overlooking the selection bias inherent in the adaptive process. Selection Bias arises because the question selection is strongly influenced by the estimated proficiency, such as assigning easier questions to learners with lower proficiency and harder ones to learners with higher proficiency. Since the selection depends on prior estimation, this bias propagates into the diagnosis model, which is further amplified during iterative updates, leading to misalignment and biased predictions. Moreover, the imbalanced nature of learners' historical interactions often exacerbates the bias in diagnosis models. To address this issue, we propose a debiasing framework consisting of two key modules: Cross-Attribute Examinee Retrieval and Selective Mixup-based Regularization. First, we retrieve balanced examinees with relatively even distributions of correct and incorrect responses and use them as neutral references for biased examinees. Then, mixup is applied between each biased examinee and its matched balanced counterpart under label consistency. This augmentation enriches the diversity of bias-conflicting samples and smooths selection boundaries. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets with multiple advanced diagnosis models demonstrate that our method substantially improves both the generalization ability and fairness of question selection in CAT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08CAT\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u504f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CAT\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u5c5e\u6027\u8003\u751f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u5e73\u8861\u8003\u751f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u53bb\u504f\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3CAT\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

(2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6SafeRBench\uff0c\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u62ec\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff08\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u7b49\u7ea7\u7eb3\u5165\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5f15\u5165\u5fae\u601d\u7ef4\u5206\u5757\u673a\u5236\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u91ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSafeRBench\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeRBench\u53ef\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6d1e\u5bdf\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them.

This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples.

In parallel, many studies suggested investigating the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with heavy-tailed noise, both as a model for modern deep learning models and to improve their performance. However, most DP bounds focus on light-tailed noise, where satisfactory guarantees have been obtained but the proposed techniques do not directly extend to the heavy-tailed setting. Recently, the first DP guarantees for heavy-tailed SGD were obtained. These results provide $(0,\u03b4)$-DP guarantees without requiring gradient clipping. Despite casting new light on the link between DP and heavy-tailed algorithms, these results have a strong dependence on the number of parameters and cannot be extended to other DP notions like the well-established R\u00e9nyi differential privacy (RDP). In this work, we propose to address these limitations by deriving the first RDP guarantees for heavy-tailed SDEs, as well as their discretized counterparts. Our framework is based on new R\u00e9nyi flow computations and the use of well-established fractional Poincar\u00e9 inequalities.

Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports.

Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5e76\u53d1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00M\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8bd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u805a\u7126\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8bd1\u96be\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u652f\u6301\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8c03\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00M\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6d88\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u53cd\u5e94\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "M\u80fd\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u76ee\u6807\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9b\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u6258\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8bd1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Although ID algorithm is very useful and is proved effective for causal relation identification in general causal graphs (if it is identifiable), performing ID algorithm does not guarantee to obtain a practical, easy-to-estimate interventional distribution expression. We argue that the applicability of the front-door criterion is not as limited as it seems: many more complicated causal graphs can be reduced to the front-door criterion. In this paper, We introduce front-door reducibility (FDR), a graphical condition on acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) that extends the applicability of the classic front-door criterion to reduce a large family of complicated causal graphs to a front-door setting by aggregating variables into super-nodes (FDR triple) $\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^{*},\\boldsymbol{Y}^{*},\\boldsymbol{M}^{*}\\right)$. After characterizing FDR criterion, we prove a graph-level equivalence between the satisfication of FDR criterion and the applicability of FDR adjustment. Meanwhile, we then present FDR-TID, an exact algorithm that detects an admissible FDR triple, together with established the algorithm's correctness, completeness, and finite termination. Empirically-motivated examples illustrate that many graphs outside the textbook front-door setting are FDR, yielding simple, estimable adjustments where general ID expressions would be cumbersome. FDR thus complements existing identification method by prioritizing interpretability and computational simplicity without sacrificing generality across mixed graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u524d\u95e8\u53ef\u7ea6\u6027\uff08FDR\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178\u524d\u95e8\u51c6\u5219\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u524d\u95e8\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faFDR - TID\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8868\u660eFDR\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u524d\u95e8\u51c6\u5219\u9002\u7528\u6027\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u72ed\u7a84\u4e25\u683c\uff0cID\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u6613\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u524d\u95e8\u51c6\u5219\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FDR\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u8d85\u7ea7\u8282\u70b9\u628a\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u524d\u95e8\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u63d0\u51faFDR - TID\u7b97\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u5141\u8bb8\u7684FDR\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7ec8\u6b62\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3FDR\u51c6\u5219\u4e0e\u9002\u7528FDR\u8c03\u6574\u5728\u56fe\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff1b\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u524d\u95e8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u56fe\u662fFDR\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "conclusion": "FDR\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level).

While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.\n  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen\" (training data) and ``unseen\" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\\% balanced accuracy.

Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\u8bfe\u5802\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8003\u8651\u65b0\u5b66\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u62df\u8bfe\u5802\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u4e0d\u540c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e72\u9884\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u4e2a\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\uff1b\u9690\u85cf\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u96be\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e72\u9884\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u73ed\u7ea7\uff1b\u975e\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6d4b\u9a8c\u548c\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8bd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u671f\u672b\u8003\u8bd5\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u5e72\u9884\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff1b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u76ca\u3002"}}

This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior.

However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements.

It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets.

Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single \"macro-agent\", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ffd\u8e2a\u79d1\u6280\u535a\u4e3b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7c89\u4e1d\u60c5\u7eea\u8f68\u8ff9\u9075\u5faa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c2\u70b9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u535a\u5ba2\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7c89\u4e1d\u95f4\u60c5\u7eea\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4f20\u67d3\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cd\u8005\u548c\u8425\u9500\u4eba\u5458\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u60c5\u7eea\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8ffd\u8e2a\u79d1\u6280\u535a\u4e3b\u516d\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u5316\u7c89\u4e1d\u60c5\u7eea\uff0c\u5c06\u535a\u4e3b\u53d7\u4f17\u89c6\u4e3a\u201c\u5b8f\u89c2\u4e3b\u4f53\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u60c5\u7eea\u8f68\u8ff9\u9075\u5faa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e73\u5747\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e0e\u89c2\u70b9\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u7684French - DeGroot\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u535a\u5ba2\u95f4\u56e0\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7c89\u4e1d\u60c5\u7eea\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This paper argues that efficiency alone will not lead to sustainable reasoning AI and discusses research and policy directions to embed explicit limits into the optimization and governance of such systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u8d8b\u5411\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u63a8\u7406AI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9971\u548c\u70b9\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u6548\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u7406AI\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5d4c\u5165\u660e\u786e\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u8fd1\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u63a8\u7406AI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9971\u548c\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u7406AI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u4ec5\u9760\u6548\u7387\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u63a8\u7406AI\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u5728\u63a8\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u660e\u786e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.\n  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMutDafny\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793aDafny\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728794\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "Dafny\u7b49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0e\u9884\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u9700\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u8303\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5411\u4ee3\u7801\u5f15\u5165\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u53d8\u5f02\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4eceGitHub\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u517132\u4e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728794\u4e2aDafny\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30MutDafny\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b05\u4e2a\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "conclusion": "MutDafny\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bDafny\u89c4\u8303\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u52a0\u5f3a\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u542b\u5c40\u90e8\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5236\u5b9a\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7531\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5c40\u90e8 - \u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u52a0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728 MITDB \u548c AFDB \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MITDB \u548c AFDB \u4e0a\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u53d1\u4f5c\u548c Dice \u5206\u6570\u7684 F1 \u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u8fbe 96.45%\u300182.05%\u300196.31% \u548c 97.57%\u300198.31%\u300197.45%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e5f\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u53ca\u5176\u53d1\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u4e34\u5e8a\u5236\u5b9a\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

Scientists typically hypothesize about dynamical behavior, propose a mathematical model, and compare its predictions to data. However, modern computing and algorithmic advances now enable purely data-driven learning of governing dynamics directly from observations. In data-driven settings, one learns the ODE's right-hand side (RHS). Dense measurements are often assumed, yet high temporal resolution is typically both cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, one usually has only sparsely sampled data. In this work we introduce ChaosODE (CODE), a Polynomial Chaos ODE Expansion in which we use an arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion (aPCE) for the ODE's right-hand side, resulting in a global orthonormal polynomial representation of dynamics. We evaluate the performance of CODE in several experiments on the Lotka-Volterra system, across varying noise levels, initial conditions, and predictions far into the future, even on previously unseen initial conditions. CODE exhibits remarkable extrapolation capabilities even when evaluated under novel initial conditions and shows advantages compared to well-examined methods using neural networks (NeuralODE) or kernel approximators (KernelODE) as the RHS representer. We observe that the high flexibility of NeuralODE and KernelODE degrades extrapolation capabilities under scarce data and measurement noise.

Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions. We argue that making explicit these underlying assumptions can contribute to a clearer understanding of disagreements in AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faAI\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5b9e\u5728\u8bba\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u591a\u5143\u8bba\u4e24\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3AI\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "motivation": "\u660e\u786e\u5f53\u524dAI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524dAI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548cAI\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u89e3\u8bfb\u77db\u76fe\uff1b\u5bf9AI\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u5047\u8bbe\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3AI\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u3002"}}

To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them.

We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts.

The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients.

In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.\n  Keywords: time-series anomaly detection, state-space model, Mamba, Fourier transform, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFourier - KAN - Mamba\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Mamba\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFourier - KAN - Mamba\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5c42\u3001KAN\u7f51\u7edc\u548cMamba\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u95e8\u63a7\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSL\u3001SMAP\u548cSWaT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Fourier - KAN - Mamba\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators.

For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation.

A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability.

Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u5904\u8d77\u6b65\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790MLE - bench\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6539\u53d8\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u989d\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8bba\u4ecd\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5728AI\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u521b\u610f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels.

Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos.

We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level K\u00e4hler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric K\u00e4hler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a K\u00e4hler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying K\u00e4hler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale.

To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations.

However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization.

However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names.

Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training.

Addressing this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent scheduling method based on the improved Dual-Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PVTD3) algorithm. System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range.

We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions.

However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%.

However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts.

This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency.

Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis. Most of the existing methods, which include lexicon-based approaches and traditional machine learning techniques, are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification.

Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation.\n  In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics.\n  Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684STREAM - VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u79bb\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u6162\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5feb\u5c16\u5cf0\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTREAM - VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u6162\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5feb\u5c16\u5cf0\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u77ac\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u5f00\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5171SMD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6c7d\u8f66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cSTREAM - VAE\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CAP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u6e38\u4ef7\u503c\u6743\u8861\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u6e38\u4ef7\u503c\u6743\u8861\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u529b\u8870\u7aed\u60a3\u80051\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u5f71\uff08CIP\uff09\u66f2\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6210\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u4e2aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u7531\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "result": "XGB\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684AUROC\u3001AUPRC\u548cBrier\u5f97\u5206\uff1bCIP\u6210\u672c\u66f2\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6210\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\u6982\u8ff0\uff0cLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u597d\u8bc4\u3002", "conclusion": "CAP\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6574\u5408ML\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMergeDNA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Token Merging\u6280\u672f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u6f5c\u5728Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u4e14\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6700\u5c0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u5355\u5143\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5e8f\u5217\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u6f5c\u5728Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "MergeDNA\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cDNA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DNA\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MergeDNA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Accepted to SPIE Medical Imaging 2026: Image Processing", "summary": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u6269\u6563\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08dMRI\uff09\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u6210\u50cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ea4\u7ef4\u675f\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePyTorch\u7684\u6d41\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u963b\u788d\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u53ef\u5fae\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6d41\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5fae\u7684PyTorch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold.

We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels.

Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model.

However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.\n  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data.

This is particularly useful in multi-task settings or in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics can change over time. This is particularly relevant in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving. However, despite recent advances in CL, successfully applying it to reinforcement learning (RL) is still an open problem.\n  This paper highlights open challenges in continual RL (CRL) based on experiments in an autonomous driving environment. In this environment, the agent must learn to successfully park in four different scenarios corresponding to parking spaces oriented at varying angles. The agent is successively trained in these four scenarios one after another, representing a CL environment, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These experiments exposed a number of open challenges in CRL: finding suitable abstractions of the environment, oversensitivity to hyperparameters, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient use of neural network capacity.\n  Based on these identified challenges, we present open research questions that are important to be addressed for creating robust CRL systems.

However, progress is stalled by a fundamental conflict: existing models use a single autoregressive decoder for both sequential CoT reasoning and high-dimensional, parallelizable robot actions. This architectural mismatch degrades motor control and fails to forge a strong causal link between thought and action. We introduce DeepThinkVLA, which resolves this conflict through a tightly integrated architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, our hybrid-attention decoder generates sequential CoT with causal attention and then switches to bidirectional attention for fast, parallel decoding of action vectors. This design is complemented by a two-stage training pipeline: we first use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to teach the model foundational reasoning, then apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-success rewards to causally align the full reasoning-action sequence with desired outcomes. This synergy leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 97.0% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark. Our ablations confirm the design's effectiveness: the hybrid architecture alone outperforms standard decoders by 15.5%, and the final RL stage provides a crucial 2% boost to secure top performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeepThinkVLA\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f9797.0%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u601d\u8003\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u601d\u8003\u94fe\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u52a8\u4f5c\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406 - \u884c\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u7ed3\u679c\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f9797.0%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u9ad815.5%\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u53472%\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepThinkVLA\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524dCO2\u6fc0\u5149\u62bd\u5438\u6cf5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u900f\u955c\u6563\u6591\u4f20\u611f\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236CNN\u3001USB\u76f8\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VGG16\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u70df\u96fe\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6cf5\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4f7f\u70df\u96fe\u62bd\u5438\u6cf5\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e20% - 50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

This paper will assess whether we maximize overall long-term legal coherence by (A) maintaining an object classification for all future AI systems, (B) creating fictional legal persons associated with suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (giving these fictional legal persons derogable rights and duties associated with certified groups of existing persons, potentially including free speech, contract rights, and standing to sue ''on behalf of'' the AI system), or (C) recognizing non-fictional legal personhood through legal identity for suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (recognizing them as entities meriting legal standing with non-derogable rights which for the human case include life, due process, habeas corpus, freedom from slavery, and freedom of conscience). We will clarify the meaning and implications of each option along the way, considering liability, copyright, family law, fundamental rights, civil rights, citizenship, and AI safety regulation. We will tentatively find that the non-fictional personhood approach may be best from a coherence perspective, for at least some advanced AI systems. An object approach may prove untenable for sufficiently humanoid advanced systems, though we suggest that it is adequate for currently existing systems as of 2025. While fictional personhood would resolve some coherence issues for future systems, it would create others and provide solutions that are neither durable nor fit for purpose. Finally, our review will suggest that ''hybrid'' approaches are likely to fail and lead to further incoherence: the choice between object, fictional person and non-fictional person is unavoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8ba4\u4e3a\u975e\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u591a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u54ea\u79cd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u7c7b\u9009\u9879\uff08\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u865a\u6784\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u683c\u3001\u975e\u865a\u6784\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4eba\u683c\uff09\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89d2\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u548c\u975e\u865a\u6784\u4eba\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u505a\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728MELD\u548cIEMOCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9MELD\u548cIEMOCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u65bd\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RecoMadeEasy(R)\u5f15\u64ce\u63d0\u53d6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03MPNet - v2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u7684MLP\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eMAMBA\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728MELD\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe64.8%\uff0c\u5728IEMOCAP\u4e0a\u8fbe74.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e26\u6765\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4f4e\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEdge - Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA)\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u4ea4\u53c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165EGSA\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728Syn - TODD\u548cClearPose\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cEGSA\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MODEST\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u900f\u660e\u533a\u57df\u6539\u8fdb\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks.

This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification.

The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches.

While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow.

Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.\n  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.\n  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations.

In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165VR - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SFT\u53ef\u6fc0\u53d1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5230\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u9002\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VR - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ff7\u5bab\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u542b7920\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SFT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u53d1\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9886\u5148VLM\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u602710 - 20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728COVID - 19\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728COVID - 19\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Coswara\u548cCOUGHVID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03Audio - MAE\u548c\u4e09\u79cdPANN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6309\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u4eba\u53e3\u5206\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5185Audio - MAE\u5728Coswara\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u5728Coughvid\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\uff0cAudio - MAE\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u53e3\u5e73\u8861\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f46\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u540e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u4eba\u53e3\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Since functions over discrete structures lack overt derivatives, differentiable programs do not differentiate through them and limit where they can be used. For example, when programming a neural network, conditionals and iteration cannot be used everywhere; they can break the derivatives necessary for gradient-based learning to work. This limits the class of differentiable algorithms we can directly express, imposing restraints on how we build neural networks and differentiable programs more generally. However, these restraints are not fundamental. Recent work shows conditionals can be first-class, by compiling them into differentiable form as linear neurons. Similarly, this work shows iteration can be first-class -- by compiling to linear recurrent neurons. We present a minimal typed, higher-order and linear programming language with iteration called $\\textsf{Cajal}\\scriptstyle(\\mathbb{\\multimap}, \\mathbb{2}, \\mathbb{N})$. We prove its programs compile correctly to recurrent neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation, we conduct two experiments where we link these recurrent neurons against a neural network solving an iterative image transformation task. This determines part of its function prior to learning. As a result, the network learns faster and with greater data-efficiency relative to a neural network programmed without first-class iteration. A key lesson is that recurrent neurons enable a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MFNN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de3D\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u91cd\u5efa3D\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u8870\u8001\u751f\u7406\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u75c5\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMFNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u524d\u9988\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7403\u4f53\u548c\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u8868\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u540c\u80da\uff0c\u7528\u8017\u6563\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MFNN\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u5750\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d8595%\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u659c\u622a\u9762\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "MFNN\u80fd\u4ece\u5e38\u89c4\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u8870\u8001\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de3D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u3002"}}

Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies.\n  We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks.

Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%.

WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities.

To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations.

However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention.

Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications.

However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training.

We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text \"representationally simple\" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively \"easy\", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08ID\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ID\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e92\u8865\u3001\u5177\u6709\u4f53\u88c1\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u89e3\u8bfbID\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08ID\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "1.

To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples.

To address this, we propose OEMA, a zero-shot clinical NER framework using multi-agent collaboration.

Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $\u03c1=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784BrainRotViT\u8fdb\u884c\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0eCNN\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548cSOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7eafTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBrainRotViT\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u77e2\u72b6\u5207\u7247\u751f\u6210\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u76842D\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u5728\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u7ed3\u5408\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6027\u522b\u7684\u6b8b\u5deeCNN\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fde\u7eed\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2dMAE\u4e3a3.34\u5e74\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u57284\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u961f\u5217\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8001\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u8111\u8001\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8111\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f25\u5408CNN\u548cTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8870\u8001\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback.

We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios.

While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process.

Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability.

However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u58f0\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u672a\u5fc5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "ML\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30GNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u539f\u5b50\u6784\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6676\u683c\u632f\u52a8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u58f0\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u63a7\u5236\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u672a\u5fc5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u597d\u7684GNN\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u6750\u6599\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.

On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u7f51\u7edcGQN\u7528\u4e8e3D\u96f7\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728NuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u96f7\u8fbe\u957f\u6ce2\u957f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u53cd\u5c04\u7ed9\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GQN\uff0c\u4ee5\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7528\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u6ce8BEV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7EdgeFocus\u548cDeepContext Pooling\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728NuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9mAP\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534753%\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5148\u524d\u96f7\u8fbe\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad88.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5cf0\u503c\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e80%\uff0cFLOPs\u6210\u672c\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "GQN\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e3D\u96f7\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdAI\u6846\u67b6ClimateAgents\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e265\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5320\u5e74\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u4e09\u5927\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u653f\u7b56\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u68077\uff0c\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6355\u6349\u53cd\u9988\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ClimateAgents\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e265\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5320\u5e74\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6392\u653e\u6570\u636e\u53ca98\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u4e09\u5927\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u519c\u6751\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u6e05\u6d01\u70f9\u996a\u71c3\u6599\u83b7\u53d6\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u4eba\u53e3\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6e05\u6d01\u70f9\u996a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6392\u653e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cClimateAgents\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u5b64\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6c\u5411\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u884c\u52a8\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\\%p (avg. 1.78\\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods.

While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput.

We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences.

While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6D4C\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u4f1a\u56e0\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faD4C\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eD4C\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684Top - 1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "D4C\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u5728CLIP\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u662f\u9002\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance.

Most existing sampling-based algorithms neglect environmental information or the information from previous samples. Yet, these pieces of information are highly informative, as leveraging them can provide better heuristics when sampling the next state. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based planning algorithm, called \\emph{RRT*former}, which integrates the standard RRT* algorithm with a Transformer network in a novel way.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency.

However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets.

The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox.

Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services.

These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm.

However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6CODE - II\uff0c\u542b\u516c\u5f00\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5df4\u897f\u7c73\u7eb3\u65af\u5409\u62c9\u65af\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u91ca\u5e76\u7ecf\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ba1\u6838\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e4966\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5f00\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CODE - II\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08PTB - XL\u548cCPSC 2018\uff09\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CODE - II\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bca\u65ad\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7535\u56feAI\u5206\u6790\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled.

Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like \"dog\" subsumes fine-grained categories such as \"Labrador\" and \"Golden Retriever,\" and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships.

Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens.

Volunteer feedback allows food rescue organizations to identify issues early and ensure volunteer satisfaction. However, food rescue organizations monitor feedback manually, which can be cumbersome and labor-intensive, making it difficult to prioritize which issues are most important. In this work, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) assist food rescue organizers in understanding and taking action based on volunteer experiences. We work with 412 Food Rescue, a large food rescue organization based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to design RescueLens, an LLM-powered tool that automatically categorizes volunteer feedback, suggests donors and recipients to follow up with, and updates volunteer directions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of RescueLens on an annotated dataset, and show that it can recover 96% of volunteer issues at 71% precision. Moreover, by ranking donors and recipients according to their rates of volunteer issues, RescueLens allows organizers to focus on 0.5% of donors responsible for more than 30% of volunteer issues.

A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis.

This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.\n  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining.

Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions.

These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.
