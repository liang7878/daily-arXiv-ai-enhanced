### [1] [The Illusion of Procedural Reasoning: Measuring Long-Horizon FSM Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14777)
*Mahdi Samiei,Mahdi Mansouri,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 引入有限状态机执行框架评估大语言模型程序推理能力，发现模型在任务复杂度增加时性能下降，该评估有助于理解和改进模型算法可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在程序推理能力不明确，且缺乏可控、可解释的基准测试来衡量其在长推理链中的性能崩溃。

Method: 引入有限状态机执行框架，让模型根据明确的FSM定义逐步执行任务，测量转弯准确率和任务准确率。

Result: 随着任务范围或分支复杂度增加，模型性能系统下降；规则检索分支因子高时模型表现更差；大模型局部准确性提高，但多步推理仍脆弱。

Conclusion: FSM评估为诊断模型失败模式和设计归纳偏置提供透明、复杂度可控的方法，有助于建立理解和改进大语言模型算法可靠性的实验基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on tasks framed as reasoning problems, yet their true ability to perform procedural reasoning, executing multi-step, rule-based computations remains unclear. Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence. By grounding reasoning in measurable execution fidelity rather than surface correctness, this work helps establish a rigorous experimental foundation for understanding and improving the algorithmic reliability of LLMs.

### [2] [Learning Interestingness in Automated Mathematical Theory Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14778)
*George Tsoukalas,Rahul Saha,Amitayush Thakur,Sabrina Reguyal,Swarat Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章介绍了自动发现新数学理论的两个关键步骤，包括引入FERMAT环境和探索数学对象趣味性评分问题并采用进化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能中自动发现新数学理论这一重大挑战。

Method: 引入FERMAT强化学习环境，通过该环境探索数学对象趣味性评分问题，采用进化算法，引入基于大语言模型（LLM）且具有函数抽象的进化算法。

Result: 在发现初等数论和有限域方面，基于LLM的进化算法相较于硬编码基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: 推进了自动发现新数学理论的进程，并开源了FERMAT环境。

Abstract: We take two key steps in automating the open-ended discovery of new mathematical theories, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence. First, we introduce $\emph{FERMAT}$, a reinforcement learning (RL) environment that models concept discovery and theorem-proving using a set of symbolic actions, opening up a range of RL problems relevant to theory discovery. Second, we explore a specific problem through $\emph{FERMAT}$: automatically scoring the $\emph{interestingness}$ of mathematical objects. We investigate evolutionary algorithms for synthesizing nontrivial interestingness measures. In particular, we introduce an LLM-based evolutionary algorithm that features function abstraction, leading to notable improvements in discovering elementary number theory and finite fields over hard-coded baselines. We open-source the $\emph{FERMAT}$ environment at this URL(https://github.com/trishullab/Fermat).

### [3] [Ask WhAI:Probing Belief Formation in Role-Primed LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14780)
*Keith Moore,Jun W. Kim,David Lyu,Jeffrey Heo,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Ask WhAI框架用于检查和扰动多智能体交互中的信念状态，应用于医疗案例模拟，揭示智能体信念特点，提供研究多智能体科学推理中信念形成和认知孤岛的可重复方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体交互中信念状态，理解信念形成和认知孤岛问题。

Method: 提出Ask WhAI框架，记录和重放智能体交互，支持查询和反事实证据注入；应用于医疗案例模拟器进行压力测试。

Result: 模拟显示智能体信念常反映现实学科立场，如过度依赖经典研究和抗拒反证，且可追溯和询问。

Conclusion: Ask WhAI框架为研究多智能体科学推理中的信念形成和认知孤岛提供了可重复的方法。

Abstract: We present Ask WhAI, a systems-level framework for inspecting and perturbing belief states in multi-agent interactions. The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors ("act like a neurologist", "act like an infectious disease specialist"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.

### [4] [Subnational Geocoding of Global Disasters Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14788)

TL;DR: 本文提出基于GPT - 4o的自动化工作流程处理灾害数据库中的文本位置信息，实现事件地理编码，展示了大语言模型在地理信息处理中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾害数据库中位置信息以非结构化文本形式呈现，存在粒度和拼写不一致问题，难以与空间数据集集成，需要有效处理方法。

Method: 采用基于GPT - 4o的全自动工作流处理和清理文本位置信息，通过交叉核对GADM、OpenStreetMap和Wikidata三个地理信息库分配几何信息，同时分配可靠性分数。

Result: 应用于2000 - 2024年EM - DAT数据集，对17948个独特位置的14215个事件进行地理编码。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工干预，涵盖所有灾害类型，可跨多源交叉验证，能灵活重新映射到首选框架，展示了大语言模型在提取和构建非结构化文本地理信息方面的潜力，是相关分析的可扩展可靠方法。

Abstract: Subnational location data of disaster events are critical for risk assessment and disaster risk reduction. Disaster databases such as EM-DAT often report locations in unstructured textual form, with inconsistent granularity or spelling, that make it difficult to integrate with spatial datasets. We present a fully automated LLM-assisted workflow that processes and cleans textual location information using GPT-4o, and assigns geometries by cross-checking three independent geoinformation repositories: GADM, OpenStreetMap and Wikidata. Based on the agreement and availability of these sources, we assign a reliability score to each location while generating subnational geometries. Applied to the EM-DAT dataset from 2000 to 2024, the workflow geocodes 14,215 events across 17,948 unique locations. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual intervention, covers all disaster types, enables cross-verification across multiple sources, and allows flexible remapping to preferred frameworks. Beyond the dataset, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to extract and structure geographic information from unstructured text, offering a scalable and reliable method for related analyses.

### [6] [Uncertainty-Aware Measurement of Scenario Suite Representativeness for Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14853)
*Robab Aghazadeh Chakherlou,Siddartha Khastgir,Xingyu Zhao,Jerein Jeyachandran,Shufeng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文聚焦AI系统数据集代表性问题，提出概率方法量化代表性，用不精确贝叶斯方法处理有限数据和不确定先验，并给出数值示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统（如自动驾驶汽车）的可信度和安全性依赖于数据集的数据安全属性，本文聚焦其中的代表性。

Method: 提出概率方法，通过比较场景套件编码特征的统计分布与代表目标操作域（TOD）特征的对应分布来量化代表性；应用不精确贝叶斯方法处理有限数据和不确定先验。

Result: 不精确贝叶斯公式产生区间值、考虑不确定性的代表性估计，给出比较场景套件和推断的TOD分布的数值示例。

Conclusion: 可对代表性进行局部（类别间）和全局的区间估计。

Abstract: Assuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV), depends critically on the data-related safety properties, e.g., representativeness, completeness, etc., of the datasets used for their training and testing. Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.
  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.

*Fatemeh Lotfi,Hossein Rajoli,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出在分布式多智能体强化学习框架中用Sharpness - Aware Minimization增强Soft Actor Critic算法的资源管理方法，实验显示效果优于传统DRL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代网络利用O - RAN架构实现动态资源管理，现有深度强化学习模型在动态环境中鲁棒性和泛化性不足。

Method: 引入自适应和选择性的SAM机制，由时间差分误差方差驱动正则化，仅对面临高环境复杂性的智能体正则化；采用动态$ρ$调度方案优化探索 - 利用权衡。

Result: 该方法显著优于传统DRL方法，资源分配效率最高提升22%，在不同O - RAN切片中确保更好的QoS满意度。

Conclusion: 提出的资源管理方法有效，能提高资源分配效率和QoS满意度。

Abstract: Next-generation networks utilize the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enable dynamic resource management, facilitated by the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models show promise in optimizing network resources, they often struggle with robustness and generalizability in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel resource management approach that enhances the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in a distributed Multi-Agent RL (MARL) framework. Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $ρ$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.

### [8] [Learning Human-Like RL Agents Through Trajectory Optimization With Action Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15055)

Method: 将类人性表述为轨迹优化，引入MAQ框架，通过Vector - Quantized VAE将人类示范提炼为宏观动作。

Result: 在D4RL Adroit基准测试中，MAQ显著提升类人性，提高轨迹相似度得分，在人类评估研究中排名最高，且可集成到现有强化学习算法。

Conclusion: MAQ为学习类人强化学习智能体开辟了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Human-like agents have long been one of the goals in pursuing artificial intelligence. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents. Our code is available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/MAQ.

### [9] [Beyond GeneGPT: A Multi-Agent Architecture with Open-Source LLMs for Enhanced Genomic Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15061)
*Haodong Chen,Guido Zuccon,Teerapong Leelanupab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出GeneGPT存在的问题，用开源模型复现GeneGPT并发现局限，开发了模块化多智能体框架OpenBioLLM，其性能优于GeneGPT且提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GeneGPT依赖专有模型，存在可扩展性差、运营成本高、数据隐私和泛化性等问题，需改进。

Method: 先使用开源模型复现GeneGPT以发现局限，再开发模块化多智能体框架OpenBioLLM实现协调推理和基于角色的任务执行。

Result: OpenBioLLM在超90%的基准任务上匹配或优于GeneGPT，在Gene - Turing和GeneHop上取得不错分数，模块化设计降低40 - 50%延迟。

Conclusion: 开源多智能体系统在基因组问答方面有潜力。

Abstract: Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.
  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.
  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

TL;DR: 提出神经符号框架ProRAC解决RAC问题，评估显示其表现良好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型解决RAC问题

Method: 从问题中提取RAC基本元素，逐步执行动作推导最终状态并评估查询得出答案

Result: 在多个RAC基准测试中表现出色

Conclusion: ProRAC在不同基准、领域、大语言模型主干和RAC任务类型中都有良好性能

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProRAC (Progression-based Reasoning about Actions and Change), a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages LLMs to tackle RAC problems. ProRAC extracts fundamental RAC elements including actions and questions from the problem, progressively executes each action to derive the final state, and then evaluates the query against the progressed state to arrive at an answer. We evaluate ProRAC on several RAC benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance across different benchmarks, domains, LLM backbones, and types of RAC tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于大语言模型的多智能体框架Rogue One用于自动特征提取，结合外部知识，在多数据集上表现优于现有方法，还能助力科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自动特征提取方法存在整体架构、反馈机制和外部知识集成方面的局限，需要改进。

Method: 引入Rogue One框架，包含Scientist、Extractor和Tester三个智能体，采用定性反馈机制和“flooding - pruning”策略，通过集成检索增强系统引入外部知识。

Result: 在19个分类和9个回归数据集上显著优于现有方法，还在心肌数据集上发现新的潜在生物标志物。

Conclusion: Rogue One是有效的自动特征提取框架，可用于科学发现。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a "flooding-pruning" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出首个端到端评估大推理模型安全性的基准SafeRBench，能进行多维度安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型在推理过程中存在安全风险，现有评估主要关注输出，难以捕捉推理过程中的动态风险。

Method: 包括输入特征化（将风险类别和等级纳入输入设计）、细粒度输出分析（引入微思维分块机制）和人类安全对齐（用人类注释验证基于大语言模型的评估）。

Result: 在19个大推理模型上的评估表明，SafeRBench能进行详细的多维度安全评估。

Conclusion: SafeRBench可从多视角洞察大推理模型的风险和保护机制。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve answer quality through explicit chain-of-thought, yet this very capability introduces new safety risks: harmful content can be subtly injected, surface gradually, or be justified by misleading rationales within the reasoning trace. Existing safety evaluations, however, primarily focus on output-level judgments and rarely capture these dynamic risks along the reasoning process. In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出 HISE - KT 框架结合 HINs 与 LLMs 用于知识追踪，在四个公开数据集上表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于 HINs 的知识追踪方法易引入噪声且缺乏元路径实例质量评估，基于 LLMs 的方法忽略学生间丰富信息，两者都难提供准确且有依据的解释。

Method: 构建多关系 HIN 捕获结构关系，用 LLM 对元路径实例打分过滤，设计基于元路径的相似学生检索机制，使用结构化提示整合目标学生历史与相似轨迹。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，HISE - KT 在预测性能和可解释性上优于现有 KT 基线。

Conclusion: HISE - KT 框架有效结合 HINs 与 LLMs，在知识追踪的预测和解释方面表现良好。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to mine students' evolving knowledge states and predict their future question-answering performance. Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports. Experiments on four public datasets show that HISE-KT outperforms existing KT baselines in both prediction performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出COPYCHECK框架利用不确定性信号检测LLM训练集是否使用版权内容，实验效果好，有泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练常使用版权材料引发未经授权使用担忧，现有检测方法有局限。

Method: 利用不确定性模式区分训练和非训练数据，采用文件分割和无监督聚类策略。

Result: 在LLaMA 7b和LLaMA2 7b上平均平衡准确率分别达90.1%和91.6%，相对SOTA基线提升超90%，在GPT - J 6B上也表现好。

Conclusion: 首次将不确定性用于LLM版权检测，为训练数据透明度提供实用工具。

Abstract: The remarkable language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from extensive training on vast datasets, often including copyrighted material, which raises serious concerns about unauthorized use. While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.
  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen" (training data) and ``unseen" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\% balanced accuracy. It further exhibits strong generalizability across architectures, maintaining high performance on GPT-J 6B. This work presents the first application of uncertainty for copyright detection in LLMs, offering practical tools for training data transparency.

Result: 在股票投资案例中，不同场景下收敛，年化回报优于仅使用优化器的方法。

Conclusion: SOLID为不同领域的智能决策提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces SOLID (Synergizing Optimization and Large Language Models for Intelligent Decision-Making), a novel framework that integrates mathematical optimization with the contextual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SOLID facilitates iterative collaboration between optimization and LLMs agents through dual prices and deviation penalties. This interaction improves the quality of the decisions while maintaining modularity and data privacy. The framework retains theoretical convergence guarantees under convexity assumptions, providing insight into the design of LLMs prompt. To evaluate SOLID, we applied it to a stock portfolio investment case with historical prices and financial news as inputs. Empirical results demonstrate convergence under various scenarios and indicate improved annualized returns compared to a baseline optimizer-only method, validating the synergy of the two agents. SOLID offers a promising framework for advancing automated and intelligent decision-making across diverse domains.

Result: 指出仅靠效率无法实现可持续推理AI。

Conclusion: 需要在推理AI系统的优化和治理中嵌入明确限制，并探讨了相关研究和政策方向。

Abstract: AI research is increasingly moving toward complex problem solving, where models are optimized not only for pattern recognition but for multi-step reasoning. Historically, computing's global energy footprint has been stabilized by sustained efficiency gains and natural saturation thresholds in demand. But as efficiency improvements are approaching physical limits, emerging reasoning AI lacks comparable saturation points: performance is no longer limited by the amount of available training data but continues to scale with exponential compute investments in both training and inference. This paper argues that efficiency alone will not lead to sustainable reasoning AI and discusses research and policy directions to embed explicit limits into the optimization and governance of such systems.

TL;DR: 本文指出AI研究存在智能实在论和智能多元论两种潜在概念，分析其对研究的影响，认为明确这些假设可助于理解AI研究分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确当前AI研究中潜在的不同智能概念及其对研究的影响。

Method: 分析当前AI研究中的辩论，探讨两种概念在方法论、解释和AI风险评估三方面产生的不同研究方法。

Result: 两种概念在模型选择、基准设计、实验验证方法上不同；对相同经验现象解读矛盾；对AI风险评估不同。

Conclusion: 明确这些潜在假设有助于更清晰理解AI研究中的分歧。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that current AI research operates on a spectrum between two different underlying conceptions of intelligence: Intelligence Realism, which holds that intelligence represents a single, universal capacity measurable across all systems, and Intelligence Pluralism, which views intelligence as diverse, context-dependent capacities that cannot be reduced to a single universal measure. Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions. We argue that making explicit these underlying assumptions can contribute to a clearer understanding of disagreements in AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型和框架存在架构局限，缺乏自主探索推理路径能力，难以适应动态任务需求，且覆盖人类思维能力维度有限。

Method: 提出Octopus：具备六种能力编排的多模态推理新范式，定义六种核心能力并组织评估基准Octopus - Bench，Octopus能在推理中自主探索并动态选能力。

Result: Octopus在Octopus - Bench的绝大多数任务中取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: 能力协调在多模态推理中至关重要。

Abstract: Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 明确综合挑战环境与仅聚合无关任务的多任务基准的区别，强调前者更能测试智能体跨多交互挑战的深度推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Terra Nova, a new comprehensive challenge environment (CCE) for reinforcement learning (RL) research inspired by Civilization V. A CCE is a single environment in which multiple canonical RL challenges (e.g., partial observability, credit assignment, representation learning, enormous action spaces, etc.) arise simultaneously. Mastery therefore demands integrated, long-horizon understanding across many interacting variables. We emphasize that this definition excludes challenges that only aggregate unrelated tasks in independent, parallel streams (e.g., learning to play all Atari games at once). These aggregated multitask benchmarks primarily asses whether an agent can catalog and switch among unrelated policies rather than test an agent's ability to perform deep reasoning across many interacting challenges.

Motivation: 探究智能体能否像人类一样从交互中获得类人推理能力并随经验提升。

Method: 在 G2U 设定下研究，评估三个类人水平；提出 IPR 模型，用世界模型滚动评分强化 VLM 策略，引入 PhysCode 提供共享动作空间。

Result: IPR 在三个层面表现稳健，总体与 GPT - 5 相当，好奇心层面超越；性能随训练游戏和交互步骤增加而提升，可零样本迁移到未见游戏。

Conclusion: 以物理为中心的交互是稳步提升物理推理能力的途径。

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.

Motivation: DeFi发展中理解交易用户意图很关键，但因复杂合约交互、多因素及不透明日志等，现有方法缺乏深度语义洞察。

Method: 提出TIM框架，利用基于扎根理论的DeFi意图分类法和多智能体大语言模型系统，通过元级规划器、问题解决器和认知评估器协同工作。

Result: TIM显著优于机器学习模型、单LLM和单智能体基线。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于更可靠地理解DeFi用户动机，为复杂区块链活动提供上下文感知解释。

Abstract: As Decentralized Finance (DeFi) develops, understanding user intent behind DeFi transactions is crucial yet challenging due to complex smart contract interactions, multifaceted on-/off-chain factors, and opaque hex logs. Existing methods lack deep semantic insight. To address this, we propose the Transaction Intent Mining (TIM) framework. TIM leverages a DeFi intent taxonomy built on grounded theory and a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system to robustly infer user intents. A Meta-Level Planner dynamically coordinates domain experts to decompose multiple perspective-specific intent analyses into solvable subtasks. Question Solvers handle the tasks with multi-modal on/off-chain data. While a Cognitive Evaluator mitigates LLM hallucinations and ensures verifiability. Experiments show that TIM significantly outperforms machine learning models, single LLMs, and single Agent baselines. We also analyze core challenges in intent inference. This work helps provide a more reliable understanding of user motivations in DeFi, offering context-aware explanations for complex blockchain activity.

Result: 不同模型和代理框架的创意多样性不同，高性能代理的创意多样性更高，增加创意多样性能提升性能，且在其他评估指标下结论仍成立。

Abstract: AI research agents offer the promise to accelerate scientific progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine learning models. However, the field is still in its infancy, and the key factors driving the success or failure of agent trajectories are not fully understood. We examine the role that ideation diversity plays in agent performance. First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.

Abstract: Background. Bimanual psychomotor proficiency is fundamental to neurosurgical procedures, yet it remains difficult for trainees to acquire and for educators to objectively evaluate performance. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of a neurosurgical simulation platform that integrates an anatomically realistic brain model with surgical instrument tracking to support training and objective assessment of bimanual tasks in the context of subpial corticectomy. Methods. We developed and evaluated a neurosurgical simulation platform based on an ex-vivo calf brain model and a multi-camera tracking system capable of simultaneously capturing the motion of surgical instruments in both hands, including collection of real-time instrument trajectories and synchronized video recordings. These enabled extraction of motion-based, time-based, and bimanual coordination metrics. We conducted a case series involving 47 participants across four training levels: medical students, junior residents, senior residents, and neurosurgeons. Results. The tracking system successfully captured instrument motion during 81% of the periods when instruments were actively used throughout the simulation procedure. Several extracted metrics were able to significantly differentiate between levels of surgical expertise. In particular, instrument usage duration and custom-defined bimanual coordination metrics such as instrument tip separation distance and simultaneous usage time, show potential as features to identify participant expertise levels with different instruments. Conclusions. We demonstrated the feasibility of tracking surgical instruments during complex bimanual tasks in an ex-vivo brain simulation platform. The metrics developed provide a foundation for objective performance assessment and highlight the potential of motion analysis to improve neurosurgical training and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的Text2SQL代码生成方法主要关注SELECT查询，忽略SQL更新操作及其连锁反应，传统CASCADE UPDATE约束不适合现代非规范化数据库，需动态、上下文感知的更新。

Method: 将UPDATE SQL生成构建为分治任务，利用大语言模型推理能力，通过嵌套查询和子结构确保数据机密性。

Result: 在真实世界因果更新场景评估中，显示出能产生准确的SQL更新。

Conclusion: 突出了大语言模型在自动化数据库管理系统中的推理能力。

Abstract: This work introduces Castle, the first framework for schema-only cascade update generation using large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in LLMs for Text2SQL code generation, existing approaches focus primarily on SELECT queries, neglecting the challenges of SQL update operations and their ripple effects. Traditional CASCADE UPDATE constraints are static and unsuitable for modern, denormalized databases, which demand dynamic, context-aware updates. Castle enables natural language instructions to trigger multi-column, causally consistent SQL UPDATE statements, without revealing table content to the model. By framing UPDATE SQL generation as a divide-and-conquer task with LLMs' reasoning capacity, Castle can determine not only which columns must be directly updated, but also how those updates propagate through the schema, causing cascading updates -- all via nested queries and substructures that ensure data confidentiality. We evaluate it on real-world causal update scenarios, demonstrating its ability to produce accurate SQL updates, and thereby highlighting the reasoning ability of LLMs in automated DBMS.

Conclusion: BBox DocVQA数据集能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，数据和代码公开将推动可解释和空间定位视觉语言推理研究。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a fundamental task for multimodal document understanding and a key testbed for vision language reasoning. However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning.

Motivation: 当前广泛使用的HNSW算法存在内存设计、缓存性能差、加速范围有限和仅支持语义相似查询等问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 将输入数据划分为包含语义相似项的块，构建B+树变体在内存和磁盘存储块，支持混合的基于边和块的内存遍历。

Result: B+ANN在质量（召回值）和执行性能（每秒查询数）上优于HNSW，减少缓存缺失19.23%，内存消耗和磁盘构建时间比DiskANN算法减少24倍，还支持相异性查询。

Conclusion: B+ANN能有效解决HNSW的问题，在性能和功能上有显著提升。

Abstract: Storing and processing of embedding vectors by specialized Vector databases (VDBs) has become the linchpin in building modern AI pipelines. Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm. Finally, it enables dissimilarity queries, which are not supported by similarity-oriented ANN indices.

Result: 发现系统创新和数据库理论可启发新的交互与可视化设计。

Conclusion: HDI系统是可靠、交互式、AI驱动应用的基础。

Abstract: Human-data interaction (HDI) presents fundamentally different challenges from traditional data management. HDI systems must meet latency, correctness, and consistency needs that stem from usability rather than query semantics; failing to meet these expectations breaks the user experience. Moreover, interfaces and systems are tightly coupled; neither can easily be optimized in isolation, and effective solutions demand their co-design. This dependence also presents a research opportunity: rather than adapt systems to interface demands, systems innovations and database theory can also inspire new interaction and visualization designs. We survey a decade of our lab's work that embraces this coupling and argue that HDI systems are the foundation for reliable, interactive, AI-driven applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN在AI for Science领域有优势，但现有并行实现GPU利用率低阻碍实际应用。

Method: 将多项式KAN层的前后向传播融合为优化的CUDA内核，采用查找表、2D分块、两阶段规约、系数布局重排序四种技术。

Result: 以Chebyshev KAN为例，在高端和消费级GPU上，推理快1.2 - 10倍，训练快1.4 - 12倍，精度相同。

Conclusion: PolyKAN能有效提高KAN在GPU上的运行效率。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) promise higher expressive capability and stronger interpretability than Multi-Layer Perceptron, particularly in the domain of AI for Science. However, practical adoption has been hindered by low GPU utilization of existing parallel implementations. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated operator library, named PolyKAN which is the first general open-source implementation of KAN and its variants. PolyKAN fuses the forward and backward passes of polynomial KAN layers into a concise set of optimized CUDA kernels. Four orthogonal techniques underpin the design: (i) \emph{lookup-table} with linear interpolation that replaces runtime expensive math-library functions; (ii) \emph{2D tiling} to expose thread-level parallelism with preserving memory locality; (iii) a \emph{two-stage reduction} scheme converting scattered atomic updates into a single controllable merge step; and (iv) \emph{coefficient-layout reordering} yielding unit-stride reads under the tiled schedule. Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.

Abstract: We present a general, flexible modeling abstraction for building and working with distributed optimization problems called a RemoteOptiGraph. This abstraction extends the OptiGraph model in Plasmo$.$jl, where optimization problems are represented as hypergraphs with nodes that define modular subproblems (variables, constraints, and objectives) and edges that encode algebraic linking constraints between nodes. The RemoteOptiGraph allows OptiGraphs to be utilized in distributed memory environments through InterWorkerEdges, which manage linking constraints that span workers. This abstraction offers a unified approach for modeling optimization problems on distributed memory systems (avoiding bespoke modeling approaches), and provides a basis for developing general-purpose meta-algorithms that can exploit distributed memory structure such as Benders or Lagrangian decompositions. We implement this abstraction in the open-source package, Plasmo$.$jl and we illustrate how it can be used by solving a mixed integer capacity expansion model for the western United States containing over 12 million variables and constraints. The RemoteOptiGraph abstraction together with Benders decomposition performs 7.5 times faster than solving the same problem without decomposition.

TL;DR: 文章介绍NCCL 2.28的GIN架构，包括其设计、语义及对MoE通信的影响，通过与DeepEP集成展示实用性，基准测试表明GIN能在NCCL统一运行时提供设备发起的通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI工作负载尤其是MoE架构对低延迟、细粒度且由设备端控制的GPU - GPU通信需求增加，传统主机发起的GPU通信有CPU协调开销，需要设备发起的通信。

Method: 提出GIN架构，采用三层架构，包括NCCL Core主机端API、设备端API和网络插件架构，有两种后端，并与DeepEP集成。

Result: 通过综合基准测试，GIN能在NCCL统一运行时提供设备发起的通信，结合了低延迟操作与NCCL的集体算法和生产基础设施。

Conclusion: GIN架构具有实用性，可满足现代AI工作负载对GPU - GPU通信的需求。

Abstract: Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead.
  NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.

Method: 构建两层共识架构BlueBottle，核心层BB - Core用部分容错换低延迟，防护层BB - Guard提供去中心化时间戳等功能。

Result: 实验显示BB - Core比Mysticeti降低20 - 25%的延迟。

Conclusion: BlueBottle能在温和同步假设下，在高吞吐量时实现乐观亚秒级确定性，同时保持强安全性和活性。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.

Abstract: Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems, and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly.
  Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.

Result: 建立了块深度与分叉导致确认撤销概率的关系。

Conclusion: 可依据交易金额和用户风险承受能力来评估比特币交易确认的最终性。

Abstract: We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.

Abstract: Local certification is a mechanism for certifying to the nodes of a network that a certain property holds. In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates.
  Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants).
  A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $Θ(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]

Conclusion: 在一些场景下可以用亚二次数量的复合查询学习加权图。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the exact learning problem for weighted graphs, where we are given the vertex set, $V$, of a weighted graph, $G=(V,E,w)$, but we are not given $E$. The problem, which is also known as graph reconstruction, is to determine all the edges of $E$, including their weights, by asking queries about $G$ from an oracle. As we observe, using simple shortest-path length queries is not sufficient, in general, to learn a weighted graph. So we study a number of scenarios where it is possible to learn $G$ using a subquadratic number of composite queries, which combine two or three simple queries.

Conclusion: 提出的Intergrams算法能有效且快速恢复最频繁n - gram，结合理论说明了多遍方法的有效性。

Abstract: The number of n-gram features grows exponentially in n, making it computationally demanding to compute the most frequent n-grams even for n as small as 3. Motivated by our production machine learning system built on n-gram features, we ask: is it possible to accurately, deterministically, and quickly recover the top-k most frequent n-grams? We devise a multi-pass algorithm called Intergrams that constructs candidate n-grams from the preceding (n - 1)-grams. By designing this algorithm with hardware in mind, our approach yields more than an order of magnitude speedup (up to 33x!) over the next known fastest algorithm, even when similar optimizations are applied to the other algorithm. Using the empirical power-law distribution over n-grams, we also provide theory to inform the efficacy of our multi-pass approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/rcurtin/Intergrams.

Conclusion: 明确了不同交叉类型子集下1-平面图及直线1-平面图识别问题的复杂度特征。

Abstract: A drawing of a graph is 1-planar if each edge participates in at most one crossing and adjacent edges do not cross. Up to symmetry, each crossing in a 1-planar drawing belongs to one out of six possible crossing types, where a type characterizes the subgraph induced by the four vertices of the crossing edges. Each of the 63 possible nonempty subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of crossing types gives a recognition problem: does a given graph admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, that is, a 1-planar drawing where the crossing type of each crossing is in $\mathcal{S}$?
  We show that there is a set $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$ with three crossing types and the following properties: If $\mathcal{S}$ contains no crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then the recognition of graphs that admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the treewidth of the input graph. If $\mathcal{S}$ contains any crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph has an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, even when considering graphs of constant pathwidth.
  We also extend this characterization of crossing types to 1-planar straight-line drawings and show the same complexity behaviour parameterized by treewidth.

Abstract: In a linear combinatorial optimization problem, we are given a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ of feasible subsets of a ground set $U$ of $n$ elements, and aim to find $S^* = \arg\min_{S \in \mathcal{F}} \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Traditionally, the weight vector is given, or a value oracle allows evaluating $w(S) := \langle w, \mathbbm{1}_S \rangle$. Motivated by practical interest in pairwise comparisons, and by the theoretical quest to understand computational models, we study a weaker, more robust comparison oracle that for any $S, T \in \mathcal{F}$ reveals only whether $w(S) <, =, > w(T)$. We ask: when can we find $S^*$ using few comparison queries, and when can this be done efficiently?
  We present three contributions: (1) We establish that the query complexity over any set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^U$ is $\tilde O(n^2)$, using the inference dimension framework, highlighting a separation between information and computational complexity (runtime may still be exponential for NP-hard problems under ETH). (2) We introduce a Global Subspace Learning (GSL) framework for objective functions with discrete integer weights bounded by $B$, giving an algorithm to sort all feasible sets using $O(nB \log(nB))$ queries, improving the $\tilde O(n^2)$ bound when $B = o(n)$. For linear matroids, algebraic techniques yield efficient algorithms for problems including $k$-SUM, SUBSET-SUM, and $A{+}B$ sorting. (3) We give the first polynomial-time, low-query algorithms for classic combinatorial problems: minimum cuts, minimum weight spanning trees (and matroid bases), bipartite matching (and matroid intersection), and shortest $s$-$t$ paths.
  Our work provides the first general query complexity bounds and efficient algorithms for this model, opening new directions for comparison-based optimization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we consider dynamic matroids, where elements can be inserted to or deleted from the ground set over time. The independent sets change to reflect the current ground set. As matroids are central to the study of many combinatorial optimization problems, it is a natural next step to also consider them in a dynamic setting. The study of dynamic matroids has the potential to generalize several dynamic graph problems, including, but not limited to, arboricity and maximum bipartite matching. We contribute by providing efficient algorithms for some fundamental matroid questions.
  In particular, we study the most basic question of maintaining a base dynamically, providing an essential building block for future algorithms. We further utilize this result and consider the elementary problems of base packing and base covering. We provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base packing number $Φ$ in $O(Φ\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Similarly, we provide a deterministic algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(β\cdot \text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update. Moreover, we give an algorithm that maintains a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation of the base covering number $β$ in $O(\text{poly}(\log n, \varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries per update against an oblivious adversary.
  These results are obtained by exploring the relationship between base collections, a generalization of tree-packings, and base packing and covering respectively. We provide structural theorems to formalize these connections, and show how they lead to simple dynamic algorithms.

Abstract: We extend the coopetition index introduced by Aleandri and Dall'Aglio (2025) for simple games to the broader class of monotone transferable utility (TU) games and to all non-empty coalitions, including singletons. The new formulation allows us to define an absolute coopetition index with a universal range in [-1,1], facilitating meaningful comparisons across coalitions.
  We study several notable instances of the index, including the Banzhaf, Uniform Shapley, and Shapley-Owen coopetition indices, and we derive explicit formulas that connect coopetition to classical semivalues. Finally, we provide axiomatic characterizations of the Uniform Shapley and Shaple--Owen versions, showing that each is uniquely determined by linearity, symmetry over pure bargaining games, external null player neutrality, and a contraction axiom reflecting its internal distribution. These results position the coopetition index as a versatile tool for quantifying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of coalitions in TU-games.

Abstract: This paper investigates probabilistic robustness of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems via the scenario approach. Inspired by recent advances in scenario optimization (Garatti and Campi, 2025), we obtain robustness results for key equilibria with nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs, overcoming the dependence on the non-degeneracy assumption. Specifically, under convex strategy sets for all players, we first establish a probabilistic robustness guarantee for an epsilon-stationary point by proving the monotonicity of the stationary residual in the number of scenarios. Moreover, under nonconvex strategy sets for all players, we derive a probabilistic robustness guarantee for a global minimax point by invoking the extreme value theorem and Berge's maximum theorem. A numerical experiment on a unit commitment problem corroborates our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attack (MIA) aims to determine if a data sample is used in the training dataset of a target model. Traditional MIA obtains feature of target model via shadow models and uses the feature to train attack model, but the scale and complexity of training or fine-tuning data for large language model (LLM)-based recommendation systems make shadow models difficult to construct. Knowledge distillation as a method for extracting knowledge contributes to construct a stronger reference model. Knowledge distillation enables separate distillation for member and non-member data during the distillation process, enhancing the model's discriminative capability between the two in MIA. This paper propose a knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm to improve the performance of membership inference attacks on LLM-based recommendation systems. Our paradigm introduces knowledge distillation to obtain a reference model, which enhances the reference model's ability to distinguish between member and non-member data. We obtain individual features from the reference model and train our attack model with fused feature. Our paradigm improves the attack performance of MIA compared to shadow model-based attack.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming personalized search, recommendations, and customer interaction in e-commerce. Customers increasingly shop across multiple devices, from voice-only assistants to multimodal displays, each offering different input and output capabilities. A proactive suggestion to switch devices can greatly improve the user experience, but it must be offered with high precision to avoid unnecessary friction. We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy. Incorporating a differentiable precision-oriented loss further reduces false positives. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to power intelligent, cross-device shopping assistants that anticipate and adapt to user needs, enabling more seamless and personalized e-commerce experiences.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach within natural language processing (NLP), combining neural information retrieval with generative language modeling to enhance both contextual accuracy and factual reliability of responses. Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The framework underscores the potential of AI-driven knowledge discovery to accelerate agroecological innovation and enhance decision-making in sustainable farming systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出OTCR框架解决多模态信息提取问题，在多数据集上表现良好，提供可控多模态融合范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态信息提取方法大多隐式假设模态等价或统一处理模态，依赖通用融合范式，导致多模态信号融合无差别、任务无关冗余控制不足，限制泛化能力。

Method: 提出两阶段框架OTCR，第一阶段使用跨模态最优传输生成文本标记和视觉块的稀疏概率对齐，用上下文感知门控控制视觉注入；第二阶段使用变分信息瓶颈压缩融合特征，过滤任务无关噪声。

Result: 在FUNSD和XFUND (ZH)数据集上取得了较高的SER和RE指标，特征级分析证实减少了模态冗余，增强了任务信号。

Conclusion: 该工作为文档AI中的可控多模态融合提供了可解释的信息论范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) requires fusing text and visual cues from visually rich documents. While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms. This often results in indiscriminate incorporation of multimodal signals and insufficient control over task-irrelevant redundancy, which may in turn limit generalization. We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations. On FUNSD, OTCR achieves 91.95% SER and 91.13% RE, while on XFUND (ZH), it reaches 91.09% SER and 94.20% RE, demonstrating competitive performance across datasets. Feature-level analyses further confirm reduced modality redundancy and strengthened task signals. This work offers an interpretable, information-theoretic paradigm for controllable multimodal fusion in document AI.

TL;DR: 提出情感感知社交媒体推荐框架ESMR，基于用户情感轨迹个性化内容，经评估能改善情感恢复、减少波动并保持高参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数社交媒体推荐系统仅优化参与度指标，未考虑用户情绪状态，反复接触情绪化内容会影响用户情绪健康。

Method: 提出ESMR框架，集成基于Transformer的情绪预测器和混合推荐策略，稳定期用LightGBM模型，负面情绪持续时用带因果信息奖励的强化学习代理。

Result: 通过30天交互轨迹评估，ESMR改善了情绪恢复，减少了波动，并保持了较高的参与度。

Conclusion: ESMR提供了一种在不影响参与度的情况下实现情感感知推荐的途径。

Abstract: Social media recommendation systems play a central role in shaping users' emotional experiences. However, most systems are optimized solely for engagement metrics, such as click rate, viewing time, or scrolling, without accounting for users' emotional states. Repeated exposure to emotionally charged content has been shown to negatively affect users' emotional well-being over time. We propose an Emotion-aware Social Media Recommendation (ESMR) framework that personalizes content based on users' evolving emotional trajectories. ESMR integrates a Transformer-based emotion predictor with a hybrid recommendation policy: a LightGBM model for engagement during stable periods and a reinforcement learning agent with causally informed rewards when negative emotional states persist. Through behaviorally grounded evaluation over 30-day interaction traces, ESMR demonstrates improved emotional recovery, reduced volatility, and strong engagement retention. ESMR offers a path toward emotionally aware recommendations without compromising engagement performance.

<details>

Motivation: RAG中常见的静态top - k检索方法无法适应查询特征的变化，可能导致上下文不足或信息冗余。

Method: 提出Cluster - based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR)算法，通过分析查询 - 文档相似度距离的聚类模式动态确定最佳文档数量。

Result: 在Coinbase的CDP语料库和公共MultiHop - RAG基准上，CAR始终能选择最佳检索深度，取得最高TES分数；下游RAG评估中，减少LLM令牌使用、端到端延迟和幻觉，保留答案相关性；应用后用户参与度提升200%。

Conclusion: CAR算法有效解决了RAG中静态检索的问题，能提升性能和用户参与度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by pulling in external material, document, code, manuals, from vast and ever-growing corpora, to effectively answer user queries. The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance. Since integrating CAR into Coinbase's virtual assistant, we've seen user engagement jump by 200%.

Abstract: Serving deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) at scale is challenging. Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval.
  In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model.
  Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SilverTorch's solution is 13.35x more cost-efficient than CPU-based solution while improving accuracy via serving more complex models. SilverTorch serves over hundreds of models online across major products and recommends contents for billions of daily active users.

Motivation: 当前生成式推荐方法在利用多模态信息和捕捉模态间复杂交互方面存在局限，难以学习高质量语义ID和训练有效模型。

Method: 提出Multi - Aspect Cross - modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec)方法，在ID学习过程引入跨模态量化，在生成模型训练中加入多方面跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个知名推荐数据集上进行了大量实验。

Conclusion: 所提出的MACRec方法是有效的。

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: ItemRAG方法在大语言模型推荐中有效，能提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as recommender systems, owing to their strong reasoning capability and their effectiveness in handling cold-start items. To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.

Conclusion: 所提去偏框架能有效解决CAT中的选择偏差问题，提高相关性能。

Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a widely used technology for evaluating learners' proficiency in online education platforms. By leveraging prior estimates of proficiency to select questions and updating the estimates iteratively based on responses, CAT enables personalized learner modeling and has attracted substantial attention. Despite this progress, most existing works focus primarily on improving diagnostic accuracy, while overlooking the selection bias inherent in the adaptive process. Selection Bias arises because the question selection is strongly influenced by the estimated proficiency, such as assigning easier questions to learners with lower proficiency and harder ones to learners with higher proficiency. Since the selection depends on prior estimation, this bias propagates into the diagnosis model, which is further amplified during iterative updates, leading to misalignment and biased predictions. Moreover, the imbalanced nature of learners' historical interactions often exacerbates the bias in diagnosis models. To address this issue, we propose a debiasing framework consisting of two key modules: Cross-Attribute Examinee Retrieval and Selective Mixup-based Regularization. First, we retrieve balanced examinees with relatively even distributions of correct and incorrect responses and use them as neutral references for biased examinees. Then, mixup is applied between each biased examinee and its matched balanced counterpart under label consistency. This augmentation enriches the diversity of bias-conflicting samples and smooths selection boundaries. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets with multiple advanced diagnosis models demonstrate that our method substantially improves both the generalization ability and fairness of question selection in CAT.

Result: 在个性化评论生成实验中，DRP在多个指标上始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DRP框架能有效提升大语言模型的个性化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, driving a growing demand for personalized outputs. Prior work has primarily leveraged a user's own history, often overlooking inter-user differences that are critical for effective personalization. While recent methods have attempted to model such differences, their feature extraction processes typically rely on fixed dimensions and quick, intuitive inference (System-1 thinking), limiting both the coverage and granularity of captured user differences. To address these limitations, we propose Difference-aware Reasoning Personalization (DRP), a framework that reconstructs the difference extraction mechanism by leveraging inference scaling to enhance LLM personalization. DRP autonomously identifies relevant difference feature dimensions and generates structured definitions and descriptions, enabling slow, deliberate reasoning (System-2 thinking) over user differences. Experiments on personalized review generation demonstrate that DRP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: CroPS能有效缓解过滤气泡问题，已在快手搜索全面部署服务大量用户。

Abstract: Dense retrieval has become a foundational paradigm in modern search systems, especially on short-video platforms. However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

Motivation: 细化先前关于解码器Transformer从离散提示到最后一个标记隐藏状态映射的研究，深入探究其注入性。

Method: 理论上定义碰撞判别式和注入层，证明二分性；实证研究中定义分离裕度和co - Lipschitz常数，通过最近邻统计估计，应用于预训练模型和从头训练的模型。

Result: 理论上在温和非奇异性假设和绝对连续初始化下，泛化注入性在平滑训练轨迹上持续存在；实证上全精度或8位无碰撞，4位量化有少量碰撞且co - Lipschitz估计显著缩小，小GPT - 2在训练中归一化指标稳定。

Conclusion: Transformer表示在连续参数理想化下通常具有持久注入性，其实用可逆性可用简单几何诊断方法探测。

Abstract: Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\ell \subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\ell = Θ\setminus Δ^\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\ell_θ$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $Θ/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.
  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed machine learning for language and vision, but achieving comparable impact in physical simulation remains a challenge. Data heterogeneity and unstable long-term dynamics inhibit learning from sufficiently diverse dynamics, while varying resolutions and dimensionalities challenge efficient training on modern hardware. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we incorporate new approaches to mitigate these obstacles, including a harmonic-analysis-based stabilization method, load-balanced distributed 2D and 3D training strategies, and compute-adaptive tokenization. Using these tools, we develop Walrus, a transformer-based foundation model developed primarily for fluid-like continuum dynamics. Walrus is pretrained on nineteen diverse scenarios spanning astrophysics, geoscience, rheology, plasma physics, acoustics, and classical fluids. Experiments show that Walrus outperforms prior foundation models on both short and long term prediction horizons on downstream tasks and across the breadth of pretraining data, while ablation studies confirm the value of our contributions to forecast stability, training throughput, and transfer performance over conventional approaches. Code and weights are released for community use.

Abstract: Assessing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) over data remains an open and pressing research question. Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP).

Motivation: 当代机器学习模型架构僵化，在非平稳环境中难以持续适应和进行终身学习。

Method: 基于嵌套学习范式，提出动态嵌套层次结构，让模型能在训练或推理时自主调整优化级别、嵌套结构和更新频率。

Result: 通过数学公式、理论证明和实证，展示了在语言建模、持续学习和长上下文推理方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: 动态嵌套层次结构是迈向自适应通用智能的基础进步。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning models, including large language models, exhibit remarkable capabilities in static tasks yet falter in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that hinder continual adaptation and lifelong learning. Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.

Result: GTPO在不同推理基准测试中平均比GRPO高3.0%。

Conclusion: GTPO算法在推进现实世界复杂数学推理方面有效。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.

Conclusion: 这是首个综合考虑技术和业务因素的金融服务统一序列推荐建模研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures are widely adopted in sequential recommendation systems, yet their application in Financial Services (FS) presents distinct practical and modeling challenges for real-time recommendation. These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offers a promising opportunity to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the tradeoff between sample complexity and round complexity in on-demand sampling, where the learning algorithm adaptively samples from $k$ distributions over a limited number of rounds. In the realizable setting of Multi-Distribution Learning (MDL), we show that the optimal sample complexity of an $r$-round algorithm scales approximately as $dk^{Θ(1/r)} / ε$. For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\widetilde O((d + k) / ε^2)$ within $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\widetilde O(\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.

Abstract: As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations rapidly expand to hundreds and thousands of spacecraft, the need for distributed on-board machine learning becomes critical to address downlink bandwidth limitations. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive "space-ification" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters. These results provide actionable insights for future mission designers, enabling distributed on-board learning for more autonomous, resilient, and data-driven satellite operations.

Result: 大语言模型使用该框架能在保持任务性能的同时，实现更可靠、明智的问题解决。

Conclusion: LIT框架可提升大语言模型在解决问题时的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.

Motivation: 解决神经网络对语义无关变换的脆弱性问题，根源是“自由放任”的表征学习。

Method: 提出SCL框架，将潜在空间表征分为不变、可变和自由特征三组，通过可变机制增强对比学习。

Result: 在ECG相位不变性和IMU旋转鲁棒性实验中表现出色，如ECG相似度提升，WISDM活动识别准确率和旋转一致性高。

Conclusion: 实现从被动数据增强到主动结构学习的范式转变，使神经网络潜在表征具有可解释性。

Abstract: Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as "laissez-faire" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation. This work represents a paradigm shift from reactive data augmentation to proactive structural learning, enabling interpretable latent representations in neural networks.

Abstract: Deep graph learning has advanced Alzheimer's (AD) disease classification from MRI, but most models remain correlational, confounding demographic and genetic factors with disease specific features. We present Causal-GCN, an interventional graph convolutional framework that integrates do-calculus-based back-door adjustment to identify brain regions exerting stable causal influence on AD progression. Each subject's MRI is represented as a structural connectome where nodes denote cortical and subcortical regions and edges encode anatomical connectivity. Confounders such as age, sec, and APOE4 genotype are summarized via principal components and included in the causal adjustment set. After training, interventions on individual regions are simulated by serving their incoming edges and altering node features to estimate average causal effects on disease probability. Applied to 484 subjects from the ADNI cohort, Causal-GCN achieves performance comparable to baseline GNNs while providing interpretable causal effect rankings that highlight posterior, cingulate, and insular hubs consistent with established AD neuropathology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模可靠性和关系结构，GM在非参数学习中为局部证据和全局一致性搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Graph Memory (GM), a structured non-parametric framework that augments embedding-based inference with a compact, relational memory over region-level prototypes. Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.

Validating on held-out storm-time and quiet conditions highlights improved skill compared to persistence. By unifying heterogeneous data with scalable graph-based spatiotemporal learning, IonCast demonstrates how machine learning can augment physical understanding of ionospheric variability and advance operational space weather resilience.

Conclusion: 探测干预有助于智能辅导系统，但存在成本效益决策；强化学习和启发式策略各有优劣；更多信息对提升系统性能有益。

Abstract: While intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can use information from past students to personalize instruction, each new student is unique. Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.

Abstract: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that caused a global pandemic in 2019. It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉信息和动态，减少信息损失，更准确检测心律失常及其发作时间，助力临床制定治疗计划。

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.

Conclusion: CODE是一种有效的从稀疏数据中学习ODE的方法，同时给出了动力学学习问题的实用优化指南。

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a conventional way to describe the observed dynamics of physical systems. Scientists typically hypothesize about dynamical behavior, propose a mathematical model, and compare its predictions to data. However, modern computing and algorithmic advances now enable purely data-driven learning of governing dynamics directly from observations. In data-driven settings, one learns the ODE's right-hand side (RHS). Dense measurements are often assumed, yet high temporal resolution is typically both cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, one usually has only sparsely sampled data. In this work we introduce ChaosODE (CODE), a Polynomial Chaos ODE Expansion in which we use an arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion (aPCE) for the ODE's right-hand side, resulting in a global orthonormal polynomial representation of dynamics. We evaluate the performance of CODE in several experiments on the Lotka-Volterra system, across varying noise levels, initial conditions, and predictions far into the future, even on previously unseen initial conditions. CODE exhibits remarkable extrapolation capabilities even when evaluated under novel initial conditions and shows advantages compared to well-examined methods using neural networks (NeuralODE) or kernel approximators (KernelODE) as the RHS representer. We observe that the high flexibility of NeuralODE and KernelODE degrades extrapolation capabilities under scarce data and measurement noise. Finally, we provide practical guidelines for robust optimization of dynamics-learning problems and illustrate them in the accompanying code.

Motivation: 结直肠癌异质性高，传统TNM分期系统不适用于个性化医疗，需开发新的预后预测模型。

Method: 在TCGA发现队列训练TDAM - CRC模型，在独立外部队列验证，整合多组学数据提升模型可解释性并寻找新生物标志物。

Conclusion: AI驱动的TDAM - CRC模型为结直肠癌风险分层提供有力工具，揭示新分子靶点，促进个性化临床决策。

Abstract: Precise prognostic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high heterogeneity. The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, including industrial monitoring and fault diagnosis. Recently, Mamba-based state-space models have shown remarkable efficiency in long-sequence modeling. However, directly applying Mamba to anomaly detection tasks still faces challenges in capturing complex temporal patterns and nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we propose Fourier-KAN-Mamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Fourier layer, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and Mamba selective state-space model. The Fourier layer extracts multi-scale frequency features, KAN enhances nonlinear representation capability, and a temporal gating control mechanism further improves the model's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous patterns. Extensive experiments on MSL, SMAP, and SWaT datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Validated on three RF passive components, the framework achieves accurate modeling while using only 2.86% EM simulation time compared to traditional ML-based flow, achieving a 35 times speedup.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been significantly improved through reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, LLMs still struggle to consistently verify their own reasoning traces. This raises the research question of how to enhance the self-verification ability of LLMs and whether such an ability can further improve reasoning performance. In this work, we propose GRPO-Verif, an algorithm that jointly optimizes solution generation and self-verification within a unified loss function, with an adjustable hyperparameter controlling the weight of the verification signal. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances self-verification capability while maintaining comparable performance in reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法是脑机接口系统中基于EEG的情感解码的数据高效且抗噪的方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.

Conclusion: 这些策略能产生更平滑表示和更少语义异常值。

Abstract: It has been discovered that latent-Euclidean variational autoencoders (VAEs) admit, in various capacities, Riemannian structure. We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level Kähler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.

Abstract: In industrial equipment monitoring, fault diagnosis is critical for ensuring system reliability and enabling predictive maintenance. However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis. Additionally, a diversity loss is introduced to prevent mode collapse, encouraging the generation of diverse fault samples through inter-sample difference regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods in authenticity and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks.

Conclusion: 参数化量子电路增强的图神经网络有潜力成为大规模路由和物流优化的紧凑有效求解器。

Abstract: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a fundamental NP-hard task in intelligent transportation systems with broad applications in logistics and distribution. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promise, yet classical models rely on large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are parameter-heavy and memory-bound. We propose a Quantum Graph Attention Network (Q-GAT) within a DRL framework, where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) replace conventional MLPs at critical readout stages. The hybrid model maintains the expressive capacity of graph attention encoders while reducing trainable parameters by more than 50%. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO) with greedy and stochastic decoding, experiments on VRP benchmarks show that Q-GAT achieves faster convergence and reduces routing cost by about 5% compared with classical GAT baselines. These results demonstrate the potential of PQC-enhanced GNNs as compact and effective solvers for large-scale routing and logistics optimization.

Conclusion: MARVAL为掩码自回归扩散模型的蒸馏和RL提供了首个实用路径，实现快速采样和更好的偏好对齐。

Abstract: Masked auto-regressive diffusion models (MAR) benefit from the expressive modeling ability of diffusion models and the flexibility of masked auto-regressive ordering. However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.

Result: 使用混合RoEC+CM规则，ATPO在基准测试中显著提高推理准确性和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 利用轨迹动态是推进扩散大语言模型强化学习的关键。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging alongside autoregressive models as a powerful paradigm for complex reasoning, with reinforcement learning increasingly used for downstream alignment. Existing trajectory-based RL methods uniformly allocate policy gradients across denoising steps, implicitly treating all steps as equally important. We challenge this assumption by analyzing trajectories with several step-level metrics: entropy-based uncertainty, Confidence-Margin (CM) uncertainty, and Rate of Entropy Change (RoEC). These reveal structured "zones of confusion": transient spikes in uncertainty and instability that strongly predict final success or failure, while most steps remain stable. We propose Adaptive Trajectory Policy Optimization (ATPO), a lightweight step-selection strategy that dynamically reallocates gradient updates to these high-leverage steps without changing the RL objective, rewards, or compute budget. Using a hybrid RoEC+CM rule, ATPO delivers substantial gains in reasoning accuracy and training stability across benchmarks, showing that exploiting trajectory dynamics is key to advancing dLLM RL.

Conclusion: EntroPIC方法在大规模大语言模型训练中能有效控制熵。

Abstract: Long-term training of large language models (LLMs) requires maintaining stable exploration to prevent the model from collapsing into sub-optimal behaviors. Entropy is crucial in this context, as it controls exploration and helps avoid premature convergence to sub-optimal solutions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to maintain an appropriate level of entropy, as the training process involves a mix of positive and negative samples, each affecting entropy in different ways across steps. To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training. Experimental results show that our method successfully maintains desired entropy levels, enabling stable and optimal RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: With the global energy transition and rapid development of renewable energy, the scheduling optimization challenge for combined power-heat systems under new energy integration and multiple uncertainties has become increasingly prominent. Addressing this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent scheduling method based on the improved Dual-Delay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PVTD3) algorithm. System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range. Multi-scenario comparative validation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm not only excels in economic efficiency and grid stability but also exhibits superior sustainable scheduling capabilities in energy storage device management.

Conclusion: PLATONT框架有效，能提升跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Network tomography aims to infer hidden network states, such as link performance, traffic load, and topology, from external observations. Most existing methods solve these problems separately and depend on limited task-specific signals, which limits generalization and interpretability. We present PLATONT, a unified framework that models different network indicators (e.g., delay, loss, bandwidth) as projections of a shared latent network state. Guided by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, PLATONT learns this latent state through multimodal alignment and contrastive learning. By training multiple tomography tasks within a shared latent space, it builds compact and structured representations that improve cross-task generalization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that PLATONT consistently outperforms existing methods in link estimation, topology inference, and traffic prediction, achieving higher accuracy and stronger robustness under varying network conditions.

Motivation: 探究GRPO能否推广到表征学习模型

Method: 建立预定义输出集替代大语言模型中的令牌序列采样以生成输出组，设计专门的奖励函数

Conclusion: 提出的GRPO - RM方法有效

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), has proved its effectiveness in practical applications such as DeepSeek-R1. It raises a question whether GRPO can be generalized to representation learning models. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization for Representation Model (GRPO-RM), and investigate the performance of GRPO-like policy in post-training representation models. Specifically, our method establishes a predefined output set to functionally replace token sequence sampling in LLMs, thereby generating an output group, which is essential for the probability-driven optimization of GRPO. In addition, a specialized reward function is designed to accommodate the properties of representation models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出稀疏TTA框架SNAP，减少适应频率和数据使用，集成到五种TTA算法中可降低延迟并保持精度，适用于边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法依赖频繁适应且计算成本高，不适用于资源受限的边缘环境。

Method: 引入Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM)和Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN)两个关键组件。

Result: SNAP在仅使用1%输入数据流进行适应时仍能保持竞争力，集成到五种TTA算法中可将延迟降低93.12%，精度下降控制在3.3%以内。

Conclusion: SNAP在服务于对延迟敏感应用的边缘设备上有很强的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) adjusts models using unlabeled test data to handle dynamic distribution shifts. However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%. This demonstrates its strong potential for practical use on edge devices serving latency-sensitive applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/chahh9808/SNAP.

TL;DR: 提出Quant - Trim方法，生成硬件中立检查点，缩小FP与低比特差距，减少对编译器依赖并避免后端重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业边缘加速器依赖低比特量化，但不同供应商编译器存在差异，导致同一浮点检查点在不同后端精度不一致，迫使从业者调整模型。

Method: 结合渐进式伪量化使训练与部署的整数网格对齐，使用反向剪枝控制异常值导致的尺度膨胀并保留可学习性。

Result: 在不同模型和任务中，缩小了FP与低比特的差距，减少了对编译器启发式/校准的依赖，避免了每个后端的重新训练，并报告了准确性和边缘指标。

Conclusion: Quant - Trim方法能产生硬件中立检查点，对量化方案无关，无需特定供应商图更改，在多方面有良好表现。

Abstract: Specialized edge accelerators rely on low-bit quantization, but vendor compilers differ in scaling, clipping, and kernel support, often as black boxes. The same floating-point (FP) checkpoint can therefore yield inconsistent accuracy across backends, forcing practitioners to tweak flags or refactor models to vendor-friendly operator subsets. We introduce Quant-Trim, a training-phase method that produces a hardware-neutral checkpoint robust to backend and precision choices. It combines progressive fake quantization to align training with the deployed integer grid and reverse pruning to tame outlier-driven scale inflation while preserving learnability. Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric,per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes.Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP,low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining. We report accuracy and edge metrics latency, throughput, energy/inference, and cost under static/dynamic activation scaling and varying operator coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对TSFMs表示基本时间序列概念的内部机制理解不足，需进行系统研究。

Method: 使用逐层分析、线性可恢复性测试和表示相似性度量等方法。

Result: 早期层捕捉局部时域模式，深层编码分散和变化时间信号，频谱和扭曲因素线性恢复最难，组合设置中探测性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前TSFMs在表示原子概念时较可靠，但在处理概念组合时存在局限。

Abstract: Time-series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently emerged as a universal paradigm for learning across diverse temporal domains. However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于离散Krawtchouk多项式的GNN滤波器KrawtchoukNet，解决谱图神经网络的过平滑和异质图性能崩溃问题，并取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于多项式滤波器的谱图神经网络存在异质图性能崩溃和高多项式阶数过平滑问题，源于标准滤波器的静态低通特性。

Method: 提出基于离散Krawtchouk多项式的KrawtchoukNet，通过固定多项式域N和使滤波器形状参数p可学习来解决问题。

Result: KrawtchoukNet对过平滑有很强的鲁棒性，在K=10时取得SOTA结果；在异质基准测试中优于标准GNN。

Conclusion: KrawtchoukNet为谱图神经网络的两个关键问题提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on polynomial filters, such as ChebyNet, suffer from two critical limitations: 1) performance collapse on "heterophilic" graphs and 2) performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters. In this work, we propose `KrawtchoukNet`, a GNN filter based on the discrete Krawtchouk polynomials. We demonstrate that `KrawtchoukNet` provides a unified solution to both problems through two key design choices. First, by fixing the polynomial's domain N to a small constant (e.g., N=20), we create the first GNN filter whose recurrence coefficients are \textit{inherently bounded}, making it exceptionally robust to over-smoothing (achieving SOTA results at K=10). Second, by making the filter's shape parameter p learnable, the filter adapts its spectral response to the graph data. We show this adaptive nature allows `KrawtchoukNet` to achieve SOTA performance on challenging heterophilic benchmarks (Texas, Cornell), decisively outperforming standard GNNs like GAT and APPNP.

Conclusion: `LaguerreNet`是一种有效解决谱图神经网络问题的方法，能显著提升性能并增强抗过平滑能力。

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from two critical limitations: poor performance on "heterophilic" graphs and performance collapse at high polynomial degrees (K), known as over-smoothing. Both issues stem from the static, low-pass nature of standard filters (e.g., ChebyNet). While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions. In this work, we propose `LaguerreNet`, a novel GNN filter based on continuous Laguerre polynomials. `LaguerreNet` learns the filter's spectral shape by making its core alpha parameter trainable, thereby advancing the adaptive polynomial approach. We solve the severe O(k^2) numerical instability of these unbounded polynomials using a `LayerNorm`-based stabilization technique. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach is highly effective: 1) `LaguerreNet` achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging heterophilic benchmarks. 2) It is exceptionally robust to over-smoothing, with performance peaking at K=10, an order of magnitude beyond where ChebyNet collapses.

Motivation: 汽车遥测数据存在慢漂移和快尖峰，标准重建方法难以可靠检测异常。

Method: 提出STREAM - VAE模型，用双路径编码器分离慢漂移和快尖峰信号动态，解码器将瞬态偏差与正常操作模式分开表示。

Result: 在汽车遥测数据集和公共SMD基准上的实验显示，相比其他基线方法，分离漂移和尖峰动态提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 明确分离漂移和尖峰动态有助于汽车遥测数据异常检测，STREAM - VAE模型适合部署。

Abstract: Automotive telemetry data exhibits slow drifts and fast spikes, often within the same sequence, making reliable anomaly detection challenging. Standard reconstruction-based methods, including sequence variational autoencoders (VAEs), use a single latent process and therefore mix heterogeneous time scales, which can smooth out spikes or inflate variances and weaken anomaly separation.
  In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics.
  Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.

Method: 评估33种（现有和新的）集成模型在50个真实数据集上的表现，提出多层堆叠框架。

Result: 堆叠能持续提高准确性，但无单一堆叠器在所有任务中表现最佳；多层堆叠框架在不同预测场景中提供更优准确性。

Conclusion: 基于堆叠的方法有潜力改进时间序列预测的AutoML系统。

Abstract: Ensembling is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of machine learning models, with methods like stacking achieving strong results in tabular tasks. In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.

Motivation: 解决机器学习预测模型在开发时未考虑下游价值权衡和临床可解释性的问题。

Method: 开发预测心力衰竭患者1年死亡率的ML模型；引入临床影响投影（CIP）曲线可视化成本维度；使用四个LLM代理生成患者特定描述；由临床医生评估系统决策支持价值。

Result: XGB模型表现最佳，有较好的AUROC、AUPRC和Brier得分；CIP成本曲线提供群体层面成本组成概述，LLM进行个体层面成本效益分析；系统获临床医生好评。

Conclusion: CAP利用LLM代理整合ML分类器结果和成本效益分析，实现更透明和可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability. This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力成为模型分析的有价值工具。

Abstract: Assessing the importance of individual features in Machine Learning is critical to understand the model's decision-making process. While numerous methods exist, the lack of a definitive ground truth for comparison highlights the need for alternative, well-founded measures. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc local feature importance method called Counterfactual Importance Distribution (CID). We generate two sets of positive and negative counterfactuals, model their distributions using Kernel Density Estimation, and rank features based on a distributional dissimilarity measure. This measure, grounded in a rigorous mathematical framework, satisfies key properties required to function as a valid metric. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by comparing with well-established local feature importance explainers. Our method not only offers complementary perspectives to existing approaches, but also improves performance on faithfulness metrics (both for comprehensiveness and sufficiency), resulting in more faithful explanations of the system. These results highlight its potential as a valuable tool for model analysis.

Conclusion: 为构建无灾难性遗忘、可扩展的领域自适应基础模型提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Domain-specific post-training often causes catastrophic forgetting, making foundation models lose their general reasoning ability and limiting their adaptability to dynamic real-world environments. Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks. Our results highlight a practical path to scalable, domain-adaptive foundation models without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: 在1297名健康受试者上训练达到先进精度，在27名MCI和AD患者队列验证，患者脑龄差距和原型对齐误差显著更高。

Conclusion: EVA - Net为使用不完美医疗数据的医疗智能提供可解释框架。

Abstract: The brain age is a key indicator of brain health. While electroencephalography (EEG) is a practical tool for this task, existing models struggle with the common challenge of imperfect medical data, such as learning a ``normal'' baseline from weakly supervised, healthy-only cohorts. This is a critical anomaly detection task for identifying disease, but standard models are often black boxes lacking an interpretable structure. We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold. EVA-Net provides an interpretable framework for healthcare intelligence using imperfect medical data.

Abstract: We present a class of algorithms for state estimation in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach is based on a variational Lagrangian formulation that casts Bayesian inference as a sequence of entropic trust-region updates subject to dynamic constraints. This framework gives rise to a family of forward-backward algorithms, whose structure is determined by the chosen factorization of the variational posterior. By focusing on Gauss--Markov approximations, we derive recursive schemes with favorable computational complexity. For general nonlinear, non-Gaussian models we close the recursions using generalized statistical linear regression and Fourier--Hermite moment matching.

In this paper, we investigate how the latent spaces evolve across layers in tabular ICL models, identify potential redundant layers, and compare these dynamics with those observed in LLMs. We analyze TabPFN and TabICL through the "layers as painters" perspective, finding that only subsets of layers share a common representational language, suggesting structural redundancy and offering opportunities for model compression and improved interpretability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a classification method using in-context learning in time-series foundation models (TSFM). We show how data, which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning. We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions. This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, balancing energy efficiency and fair participation while ensuring high model accuracy remains challenging in wireless edge systems due to heterogeneous resources, unequal client contributions, and limited communication capacity. To address these challenges, we propose FairEnergy, a fairness-aware energy minimization framework that integrates a contribution score capturing both the magnitude of updates and their compression ratio into the joint optimization of device selection, bandwidth allocation, and compression level. The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization. Experiments on non-IID data show that FairEnergy achieves higher accuracy while reducing energy consumption by up to 79\% compared to baseline strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)拟合高分辨率信号计算成本高，需优化大量坐标。

Method: 提出NINT方法，利用Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)，通过NTK增强损失梯度的范数对样本打分，动态选择使全局函数更新最大化的坐标。

Result: 通过大量实验，NINT显著减少近半训练时间，保持或提升表示质量。

Conclusion: NINT在近期基于采样的策略中实现了最先进的加速。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterize continuous signals via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enabling compact, resolution-independent modeling for tasks like image, audio, and 3D reconstruction. However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

Motivation: 现有地面车辆运行时地理围栏解决方案难以兼顾高保真学习和可验证控制的结构要求。

Method: 引入PCARNN - DCBF管道，PCARNN保留车辆动力学的控制仿射结构，DCBF通过实时二次规划执行多边形约束。

Result: 在CARLA中对电动和燃烧平台的实验显示，该结构保留方法性能显著优于分析和无结构神经基线。

Conclusion: PCARNN - DCBF管道在地面车辆运行时地理围栏方面是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Runtime geofencing for ground vehicles is rapidly emerging as a critical technology for enforcing Operational Design Domains (ODDs). However, existing solutions struggle to reconcile high-fidelity learning with the structural requirements of verifiable control. We address this by introducing PCARNN-DCBF, a novel pipeline integrating a Physics-encoded Control-Affine Residual Neural Network with a preview-based Discrete Control Barrier Function. Unlike generic learned models, PCARNN explicitly preserves the control-affine structure of vehicle dynamics, ensuring the linearity required for reliable optimization. This enables the DCBF to enforce polygonal keep-in constraints via a real-time Quadratic Program (QP) that handles high relative degree and mitigates actuator saturation. Experiments in CARLA across electric and combustion platforms demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach significantly outperforms analytical and unstructured neural baselines.

Motivation: 尽管持续学习（CL）有进展，但成功应用于强化学习（RL）仍是开放问题，尤其在自动驾驶等场景有应用需求。

Method: 在自动驾驶环境中，让智能体依次在四个不同停车场景中使用近端策略优化（PPO）算法进行训练。

Result: 实验暴露出CRL存在环境抽象、超参数敏感、灾难性遗忘和神经网络容量利用等挑战。

Conclusion: 需解决相关研究问题以创建稳健的CRL系统，质疑神经网络用于CL的适用性，呼吁计算机科学和神经科学的跨学科研究。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning that aims to enable agents to adapt and generalise previously learned abilities so that these can be reapplied to new tasks or environments. This is particularly useful in multi-task settings or in non-stationary environments, where the dynamics can change over time. This is particularly relevant in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving. However, despite recent advances in CL, successfully applying it to reinforcement learning (RL) is still an open problem.
  This paper highlights open challenges in continual RL (CRL) based on experiments in an autonomous driving environment. In this environment, the agent must learn to successfully park in four different scenarios corresponding to parking spaces oriented at varying angles. The agent is successively trained in these four scenarios one after another, representing a CL environment, using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These experiments exposed a number of open challenges in CRL: finding suitable abstractions of the environment, oversensitivity to hyperparameters, catastrophic forgetting, and efficient use of neural network capacity.
  Based on these identified challenges, we present open research questions that are important to be addressed for creating robust CRL systems. In addition, the identified challenges call into question the suitability of neural networks for CL. We also identify the need for interdisciplinary research, in particular between computer science and neuroscience.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型用单一自回归解码器处理思考和行动，存在架构不匹配问题，影响电机控制和思考与行动的因果联系，需解决该问题。

Method: 采用混合注意力解码器，先用因果注意力生成顺序思考链，再用双向注意力并行解码动作向量；使用两阶段训练策略，先监督微调训练基础推理能力，再用强化学习使推理 - 行动序列与期望结果因果对齐。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中取得97.0%的成功率；混合架构比标准解码器性能高15.5%，强化学习阶段提升2%。

Conclusion: DeepThinkVLA的架构和训练策略有效，能解决现有模型冲突，实现思考与行动的因果对齐，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to "think before acting" via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a promising path to overcoming the data-hungry nature of end-to-end robot policies. However, progress is stalled by a fundamental conflict: existing models use a single autoregressive decoder for both sequential CoT reasoning and high-dimensional, parallelizable robot actions. This architectural mismatch degrades motor control and fails to forge a strong causal link between thought and action. We introduce DeepThinkVLA, which resolves this conflict through a tightly integrated architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, our hybrid-attention decoder generates sequential CoT with causal attention and then switches to bidirectional attention for fast, parallel decoding of action vectors. This design is complemented by a two-stage training pipeline: we first use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to teach the model foundational reasoning, then apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-success rewards to causally align the full reasoning-action sequence with desired outcomes. This synergy leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 97.0% success rate on the LIBERO benchmark. Our ablations confirm the design's effectiveness: the hybrid architecture alone outperforms standard decoders by 15.5%, and the final RL stage provides a crucial 2% boost to secure top performance.

Abstract: Strong reasoning capabilities can now be achieved by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are well studied in the context of fine-tuning, how quantization impacts RL in large reasoning models (LRMs) remains an open question. To answer this question, we conducted systematic experiments and discovered a significant gap in reasoning performance on mathematical benchmarks between post-RL quantized models and their quantization-aware RL optimized counterparts. Our findings suggest that quantization-aware RL training negatively impacted the learning process, whereas PTQ and QLoRA led to greater performance.

Conclusion: 在储层计算架构中明确纳入多尺度特征映射对建模具有快慢相互作用的复杂动力系统有效。

Abstract: Forecasting nonlinear time series with multi-scale temporal structures remains a central challenge in complex systems modeling. We present a novel reservoir computing framework that combines delay embedding with random Fourier feature (RFF) mappings to capture such dynamics. Two formulations are investigated: a single-scale RFF reservoir, which employs a fixed kernel bandwidth, and a multi-scale RFF reservoir, which integrates multiple bandwidths to represent both fast and slow temporal dependencies. The framework is applied to a diverse set of canonical systems: neuronal models such as the Rulkov map, Izhikevich model, Hindmarsh-Rose model, and Morris-Lecar model, which exhibit spiking, bursting, and chaotic behaviors arising from fast-slow interactions; and ecological models including the predator-prey dynamics and Ricker map with seasonal forcing, which display multi-scale oscillations and intermittency. Across all cases, the multi-scale RFF reservoir consistently outperforms its single-scale counterpart, achieving lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and more robust long-horizon predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly incorporating multi-scale feature mappings into reservoir computing architectures for modeling complex dynamical systems with intrinsic fast-slow interactions.

Abstract: Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms typically require tailored designs for knowledge transfer, in order to assure convergence and optimality in multitask optimization. In this paper, we explore designing a systematic and generalizable knowledge transfer policy through Reinforcement Learning. We first identify three major challenges: determining the task to transfer (where), the knowledge to be transferred (what) and the mechanism for the transfer (how). To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained. Comprehensive validation experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our method against representative baselines. Further in-depth analysis not only reveals the rationale behind our proposal but also provide insightful interpretations on what the system have learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络近似结果依赖误差容限ε构建网络架构和权重，本文旨在引入一种量词顺序相反的新近似范式。

Method: 利用时间计算和权重共享机制，通过运行RNN更长时间减少近似误差；构建RNN时模仿深度前馈ReLU网络近似理论的结构演算。

Result: 得到的RNN大小与误差容限ε无关，隐藏状态维度与多项式次数呈线性关系，近似误差随运行时间指数衰减。

Conclusion: 新的近似范式在内存稀缺、运行时间成本较低的硬件实现中具有吸引力，且能有效逼近单变量多项式。

Abstract: Classical neural network approximation results take the form: for every function $f$ and every error tolerance $ε> 0$, one constructs a neural network whose architecture and weights depend on $ε$. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approximation paradigm that reverses this quantifier order. For each target function $f$, we construct a single recurrent neural network (RNN) with fixed topology and fixed weights that approximates $f$ to within any prescribed tolerance $ε> 0$ when run for sufficiently many time steps.
  The key mechanism enabling this quantifier reversal is temporal computation combined with weight sharing: rather than increasing network depth, the approximation error is reduced solely by running the RNN longer. This yields exponentially decaying approximation error as a function of runtime while requiring storage of only a small, fixed set of weights. Such architectures are appealing for hardware implementations where memory is scarce and runtime is comparatively inexpensive.
  To initiate the systematic development of this novel approximation paradigm, we focus on univariate polynomials. Our RNN constructions emulate the structural calculus underlying deep feed-forward ReLU network approximation theory -- parallelization, linear combinations, affine transformations, and, most importantly, a clocked mechanism that realizes function composition within a single recurrent architecture. The resulting RNNs have size independent of the error tolerance $ε$ and hidden-state dimension linear in the degree of the polynomial.

Specifically, we consider complicated functions with numerous local minima, as is often the case for real-world data mining losses. We do so by applying a model from theoretical physics to create an Ising model-based evolutionary optimization algorithm. Our algorithm creates stable regions of local optima and a high potential for improvement between these regions. This enables the accurate identification of global minima, surpassing comparable methods, and has promising applications to ensembles.

Result: DB - SAEA在不同基准上优于现有基线，在高维未见任务上有零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该工作引入首个对SAEAs进行双级控制并具有双空间ELA的MetaBBO框架。

Abstract: Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) are widely used for expensive Black-Box Optimization. However, their reliance on rigid, manually designed components such as infill criteria and evolutionary strategies during the search process limits their flexibility across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Dual-Control Bi-Space Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (DB-SAEA), a Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) framework tailored for multi-objective problems. DB-SAEA learns a meta-policy that jointly regulates candidate generation and infill criterion selection, enabling dual control. The bi-space Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module in DB-SAEA adopts an attention-based architecture to capture optimization states from both true and surrogate evaluation spaces, while ensuring scalability across problem dimensions, population sizes, and objectives. Additionally, we integrate TabPFN as the surrogate model for accurate and efficient prediction with uncertainty estimation. The framework is trained via reinforcement learning, leveraging parallel sampling and centralized training to enhance efficiency and transferability across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that DB-SAEA not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, but also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks with higher-dimensional settings. This work introduces the first MetaBBO framework with dual-level control over SAEAs and a bi-space ELA that captures surrogate model information.

Result: 在Qwen3 - 30B和Qwen3 - 80B MoE模型及六个代表性基准测试中，DynaExq能在单RTX 5090和A6000 GPU上部署大语言模型，比静态低精度基线精度提升达4.03点。

Conclusion: 自适应、感知工作负载的量化是内存受限的MoE服务的有效策略。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale LLM capacity efficiently, but deployment on consumer GPUs is limited by the large memory footprint of inactive experts. Static post-training quantization reduces storage costs but cannot adapt to shifting activation patterns, causing accuracy loss under aggressive compression. So we present DynaExq, a runtime system that treats expert precision as a first-class, dynamically managed resource. DynaExq combines (1) a hotness-aware precision controller that continuously aligns expert bit-widths with long-term activation statistics, (2) a fully asynchronous precision-switching pipeline that overlaps promotion and demotion with MoE computation, and (3) a fragmentation-free memory pooling mechanism that supports hybrid-precision experts with deterministic allocation. Together, these components enable stable, non-blocking precision transitions under strict HBM budgets.
  Across Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-80B MoE models and six representative benchmarks, DynaExq deploys large LLMs on single RTX 5090 and A6000 GPUs and improves accuracy by up to 4.03 points over static low-precision baselines. The results show that adaptive, workload-aware quantization is an effective strategy for memory-constrained MoE serving.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning represents a frontier in computational research, combining the potential advantages of quantum computing with established classical optimization techniques. PennyLane provides a Python framework that seamlessly bridges quantum circuits and classical machine learning, enabling researchers to build, optimize, and deploy variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces PennyLane as a versatile tool for quantum machine learning, optimization, and quantum chemistry applications. We demonstrate use cases including quantum kernel methods, variational quantum eigensolvers, portfolio optimization, and integration with classical ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Through concrete Python examples with widely used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, we show how PennyLane facilitates efficient quantum circuit construction, automatic differentiation, and hybrid optimization workflows. By situating PennyLane within the broader context of quantum computing and machine learning, we highlight its role as a methodological building block for quantum-enhanced data science. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that bridges foundational quantum computing concepts and applied machine learning practice, making PennyLane a default citation for hybrid quantum-classical workflows in Python-based research.

Abstract: Early detection of faults in district heating substations is imperative to reduce return temperatures and enhance efficiency. However, progress in this domain has been hindered by the limited availability of public, labelled datasets. We present an open source framework combining a service report validated public dataset, an evaluation method based on Accuracy, Reliability, and Earliness, and baseline results implemented with EnergyFaultDetector, an open source Python framework.
  The dataset contains time series of operational data from 93 substations across two manufacturers, annotated with a list of disturbances due to faults and maintenance actions, a set of normal-event examples and detailed fault metadata. We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days.
  Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.

Conclusion: 自动配置与大语言模型驱动的代码进化结合是推进启发式设计和元启发式优化的有效且低成本途径。

Abstract: Automatic algorithm configuration tools such as irace efficiently tune parameter values but leave algorithmic code unchanged. This paper introduces a first version of irace-evo, an extension of irace that integrates code evolution through large language models (LLMs) to jointly explore parameter and code spaces. The proposed framework enables multi-language support (e.g., C++, Python), reduces token consumption via progressive context management, and employs the Always-From-Original principle to ensure robust and controlled code evolution. We evaluate irace-evo on the Construct, Merge, Solve & Adapt (CMSA) metaheuristic for the Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (VSBPP). Experimental results show that irace-evo can discover new algorithm variants that outperform the state-of-the-art CMSA implementation while maintaining low computational and monetary costs. Notably, irace-evo generates competitive algorithmic improvements using lightweight models (e.g., Claude Haiku 3.5) with a total usage cost under 2 euros. These results demonstrate that coupling automatic configuration with LLM-driven code evolution provides a powerful, cost-efficient avenue for advancing heuristic design and metaheuristic optimization.

Conclusion: 讨论两种方法优缺点、提示设计考虑及未来人机混合评分系统方向，以提高CS课程评分的一致性、效率和公平性。

Abstract: Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading.
  This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types.
  Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.

Abstract: IT environments typically have logging mechanisms to monitor system health and detect issues. However, the huge volume of generated logs makes manual inspection impractical, highlighting the importance of automated log analysis in IT Software Support. In this paper, we propose a log analytics tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for log data processing and issue diagnosis, enabling the generation of automated insights and summaries. We further present a novel approach for efficiently running LLMs on CPUs to process massive log volumes in minimal time without compromising output quality. We share the insights and lessons learned from deployment of the tool - in production since March 2024 - scaled across 70 software products, processing over 2000 tickets for issue diagnosis, achieving a time savings of 300+ man hours and an estimated $15,444 per month in manpower costs compared to the traditional log analysis practices.

Abstract: Autonomous systems must sustain justified confidence in their correctness and safety across their operational lifecycle-from design and deployment through post-deployment evolution. Traditional assurance methods often separate development-time assurance from runtime assurance, yielding fragmented arguments that cannot adapt to runtime changes or system updates - a significant challenge for assured autonomy. Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability. We demonstrate our approach on a nuclear inspection robot scenario, and discuss its alignment with the Trilateral AI Principles, reflecting regulator-endorsed best practices.

Result: 对多个先进大语言模型评估，发现模型和评估模式存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: 提出的基准为结构化图表生成研究和开发更严谨细粒度评估方法奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in generating structured diagrams from natural language descriptions. In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: AdvPrompt - MIA方法能有效捕捉更丰富记忆模式，准确推断训练集成员，具有实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on code completion models offer an effective way to assess privacy risks by inferring whether a given code snippet was part of the training data. Existing black- and gray-box MIAs rely on expensive surrogate models or manually crafted heuristic rules, which limit their ability to capture the nuanced memorization patterns exhibited by over-parameterized code language models. To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%. In addition, our method exhibits strong transferability across different models and datasets, underscoring its practical utility and generalizability.

Abstract: Automated web application testing is a critical component of modern software development, with frameworks like Selenium widely adopted for validating functionality through browser automation. Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics. Our work lays the groundwork for future research on LLM-based web testing and provides resources to support ongoing progress in this area.

Abstract: Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂软件驱动系统开发需高效安全的软件模型，传统建模语言多聚焦单一目标，多目标编译难实现，因此开发支持多目标编译的工具和语言。

Method: 设计基于参与者模型并扩展离散事件调度语义的文本、语法驱动语言M，提供系统实体建模、消息交互和触发反应构造。

Conclusion: M语言可支持复杂系统的系统建模和多目标编译，有助于模型驱动工程。

Abstract: Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.

Conclusion: AutoSW为真正的端到端自动化软件开发提供了可行方向。

Abstract: Software development automation is a long-term goal in software engineering. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), more and more researchers are exploring approaches to software automation. They view AI systems as tools or assistants in software development, still requiring significant human involvement. Another initiative is ``vibe coding'', where AI systems write and repeatedly revise most (or even all) of the code. We foresee these two development paths will converge towards the same destination: AI systems participate in throughout the software development lifecycle, expanding boundaries of full-stack software development. In this paper, we present a vision of an iterative end-to-end automated software development paradigm AutoSW. It operates in an analyze-plan-implement-deliver loop, where AI systems as human partners become first-class actors, translating human intentions expressed in natural language into executable software. We explore a lightweight prototype across the paradigm and initially execute various representative cases. The results indicate that AutoSW can successfully deliver executable software, providing a feasible direction for truly end-to-end automated software development.

Conclusion: 可将ML文档纳入ML系统软件工程流程，把ML特定知识转化为结构化需求。

Abstract: In software engineering processes for machine learning (ML)-enabled systems, integrating and verifying ML components is a major challenge. A prerequisite is the specification of ML component requirements, including models and data, an area where traditional requirements engineering (RE) processes face new obstacles. An underexplored source of RE-relevant information in this context is ML documentation such as ModelCards and DataSheets. However, it is uncertain to what extent RE-relevant information can be extracted from these documents. This study first investigates the amount and nature of RE-relevant information in 20 publicly available ModelCards and DataSheets. We show that these documents contain a significant amount of potentially RE-relevant information. Next, we evaluate how effectively three established RE representations (EARS, Rupp's template, and Volere) can structure this knowledge into requirements. Our results demonstrate that there is a pathway to transform ML-specific knowledge into structured requirements, incorporating ML documentation in software engineering processes for ML systems.

Result: 在794个Dafny程序数据集评估MutDafny，手动分析未检测到的突变子集，发现5个需加强的规范。

Conclusion: MutDafny能有效检测Dafny规范弱点，帮助加强规范可靠性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior.
  We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.

Motivation: eBPF程序需有效优化，但现有编译器优化支持有限，手工设计优化规则有挑战，传统超级优化计算成本高。

Method: 提出EPSO，通过离线超级优化发现重写规则并缓存复用，以实现高质量优化且运行开销小。

Result: EPSO发现795条重写规则，相比Clang输出，程序大小最多减少68.87%（平均24.37%），在所有基准测试中优于K2，在92.68%的测试中优于Merlin，平均减少6.60%运行时间。

Conclusion: EPSO能有效优化eBPF程序，减小程序大小、降低运行时间，提升网络应用吞吐量并降低延迟。

Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) allows developers to extend Linux kernel functionality without modifying its source code. To ensure system safety, an in-kernel safety checker, the verifier, enforces strict safety constraints (for example, a limited program size) on eBPF programs loaded into the kernel. These constraints, combined with eBPF's performance-critical use cases, make effective optimization essential. However, existing compilers (such as Clang) offer limited optimization support, and many semantics-preserving transformations are rejected by the verifier, which makes handcrafted optimization rule design both challenging and limited in effectiveness. Superoptimization overcomes the limitations of rule-based methods by automatically discovering optimal transformations, but its high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we propose EPSO, a caching-based superoptimizer that discovers rewrite rules via offline superoptimization and reuses them to achieve high-quality optimizations with minimal runtime overhead. We evaluate EPSO on benchmarks from the Linux kernel and several eBPF-based projects, including Cilium, Katran, hXDP, Sysdig, Tetragon, and Tracee. EPSO discovers 795 rewrite rules and achieves up to 68.87 percent (average 24.37 percent) reduction in program size compared to Clang's output, outperforming the state-of-the-art BPF optimizer K2 on all benchmarks and Merlin on 92.68 percent of them. Additionally, EPSO reduces program runtime by an average of 6.60 percent, improving throughput and lowering latency in network applications.

Conclusion: 展示了生成式AI和组合优化在软件工程中的强大协同作用，强调了精确模型公式化的重要性。

Abstract: Precisely controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate efficient and concise code is a central challenge in software engineering. We introduce a framework based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) that transforms code specification into a combinatorial optimization task. The framework first prompts an LLM to generate a test suite, then formulates the Test Case Minimization (TCM) problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. This QUBO paradigm is compatible with both classical solvers and emerging hardware such as quantum annealers. Experimentally, quantum annealing solves the core TCM task 16 times faster than simulated annealing. This performance underpins our end-to-end framework, which reduces total token consumption by 36.5\% and significantly improves code quality. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between generative AI and combinatorial optimization in software engineering, highlighting the critical importance of precise model formulation.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Reinforcement Learning for the optimal execution of meta-orders, where the objective is to execute incrementally large orders while minimizing implementation shortfall and market impact over an extended period of time. Departing from traditional parametric approaches to price dynamics and impact modeling, we adopt a model-free, data-driven framework. Since policy optimization requires counterfactual feedback that historical data cannot provide, we employ the Queue-Reactive Model to generate realistic and tractable limit order book simulations that encompass transient price impact, and nonlinear and dynamic order flow responses. Methodologically, we train a Double Deep Q-Network agent on a state space comprising time, inventory, price, and depth variables, and evaluate its performance against established benchmarks. Numerical simulation results show that the agent learns a policy that is both strategic and tactical, adapting effectively to order book conditions and outperforming standard approaches across multiple training configurations. These findings provide strong evidence that model-free Reinforcement Learning can yield adaptive and robust solutions to the optimal execution problem.

Abstract: Clustering approaches that utilize convex loss functions have recently attracted growing interest in the formation of compact data clusters. Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters. By leveraging the robustness of MoM alongside the stability of convex clustering, our method enhances both performance and efficiency, especially on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates weak consistency under specific conditions, while experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow provides a general framework for minimizing an energy functional $J$ over the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \emph{modified} energy \[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \fracη{4}\int_M \Big\lVert \nabla_g \frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \Big\rVert_{2}^{2} \,ρ(dx), \] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.

Abstract: Understanding the relationships between data points in the latent decision space derived by the deep learning system is critical to evaluating and interpreting the performance of the system on real world data. Detecting \textit{out-of-distribution} (OOD) data for deep learning systems continues to be an active research topic. We investigate the connection between latent space OOD detection and classification accuracy of the model. Using open source simulated and measured Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the OOD detection cannot be used as a proxy measure for model performance. We hope to inspire additional research into the geometric properties of the latent space that may yield future insights into deep learning robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) constructs uncertainty sets for model outputs with finite-sample coverage guarantees. A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.

Conclusion: RCGP - UCB 算法在有异常值时具有鲁棒性，无异常值时性能与标准 GP - UCB 算法匹配。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is critically vulnerable to extreme outliers. Existing provably robust methods typically assume a bounded cumulative corruption budget, which makes them defenseless against even a single corruption of sufficient magnitude. To address this, we introduce a new adversary whose budget is only bounded in the frequency of corruptions, not in their magnitude. We then derive RCGP-UCB, an algorithm coupling the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) approach with a Robust Conjugate Gaussian Process (RCGP). We present stable and adaptive versions of RCGP-UCB, and prove that they achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to $O(T^{1/2})$ and $O(T^{1/3})$ corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude. This robustness comes at near zero cost: without outliers, RCGP-UCB's regret bounds match those of the standard GP-UCB algorithm.

Abstract: In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.
  Our method is implemented in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{heavylasso} available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论

Abstract: The Gini score is a popular tool in statistical modeling and machine learning for model validation and model selection. It is a purely rank based score that allows one to assess risk rankings. The Gini score for statistical modeling has mainly been used in a binary context, in which it has many equivalent reformulations such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) or the area under the curve (AUC). In the actuarial literature, this rank based score for binary responses has been extended to general real-valued random variables using Lorenz curves and concentration curves. While these initial concepts assume that the risk ranking is generated by a continuous distribution function, we discuss in this paper how the Gini score can be used in the case of ties in the risk ranking. Moreover, we adapt the Gini score to the common actuarial situation of having case weights.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于PINN的框架能有效解决最优传感器布置和参数估计问题，提高参数估计准确性。

Abstract: Parameter estimation remains a challenging task across many areas of engineering. Because data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity. The results demonstrate that our PINNs-based methodology consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to parameter values estimated from intuitively or randomly selected sensor positions.

Conclusion: 算法在实验中相对其他理论方法有竞争力。

Abstract: This paper presents a tractable algorithm for estimating an unknown Lipschitz function from noisy observations and establishes an upper bound on its convergence rate. The approach extends max-affine methods from convex shape-restricted regression to the more general Lipschitz setting. A key component is a nonlinear feature expansion that maps max-affine functions into a subclass of delta-convex functions, which act as universal approximators of Lipschitz functions while preserving their Lipschitz constants. Leveraging this property, the estimator attains the minimax convergence rate (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the intrinsic dimension of the data under squared loss and subgaussian distributions in the random design setting. The algorithm integrates adaptive partitioning to capture intrinsic dimension, a penalty-based regularization mechanism that removes the need to know the true Lipschitz constant, and a two-stage optimization procedure combining a convex initialization with local refinement. The framework is also straightforward to adapt to convex shape-restricted regression. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance relative to other theoretically justified methods, including nearest-neighbor and kernel-based regressors.

Result: 在满足分数Poincaré不等式的假设下，获得的DP保证对维度的依赖比现有技术弱得多。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了现有重尾SGD的DP保证的局限性。

Abstract: Characterizing the differential privacy (DP) of learning algorithms has become a major challenge in recent years. In parallel, many studies suggested investigating the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with heavy-tailed noise, both as a model for modern deep learning models and to improve their performance. However, most DP bounds focus on light-tailed noise, where satisfactory guarantees have been obtained but the proposed techniques do not directly extend to the heavy-tailed setting. Recently, the first DP guarantees for heavy-tailed SGD were obtained. These results provide $(0,δ)$-DP guarantees without requiring gradient clipping. Despite casting new light on the link between DP and heavy-tailed algorithms, these results have a strong dependence on the number of parameters and cannot be extended to other DP notions like the well-established Rényi differential privacy (RDP). In this work, we propose to address these limitations by deriving the first RDP guarantees for heavy-tailed SDEs, as well as their discretized counterparts. Our framework is based on new Rényi flow computations and the use of well-established fractional Poincaré inequalities. Under the assumption that such inequalities are satisfied, we obtain DP guarantees that have a much weaker dependence on the dimension compared to prior art.

Conclusion: FDR在不牺牲混合图通用性的前提下，优先考虑可解释性和计算简单性，补充了现有识别方法。

Abstract: Front-door adjustment provides a simple closed-form identification formula under the classical front-door criterion, but its applicability is often viewed as narrow and strict. Although ID algorithm is very useful and is proved effective for causal relation identification in general causal graphs (if it is identifiable), performing ID algorithm does not guarantee to obtain a practical, easy-to-estimate interventional distribution expression. We argue that the applicability of the front-door criterion is not as limited as it seems: many more complicated causal graphs can be reduced to the front-door criterion. In this paper, We introduce front-door reducibility (FDR), a graphical condition on acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) that extends the applicability of the classic front-door criterion to reduce a large family of complicated causal graphs to a front-door setting by aggregating variables into super-nodes (FDR triple) $\left(\boldsymbol{X}^{*},\boldsymbol{Y}^{*},\boldsymbol{M}^{*}\right)$. After characterizing FDR criterion, we prove a graph-level equivalence between the satisfication of FDR criterion and the applicability of FDR adjustment. Meanwhile, we then present FDR-TID, an exact algorithm that detects an admissible FDR triple, together with established the algorithm's correctness, completeness, and finite termination. Empirically-motivated examples illustrate that many graphs outside the textbook front-door setting are FDR, yielding simple, estimable adjustments where general ID expressions would be cumbersome. FDR thus complements existing identification method by prioritizing interpretability and computational simplicity without sacrificing generality across mixed graphs.

Abstract: Modelling epidemic events such as COVID-19 cases in both time and space dimensions is an important but challenging task. Building on in-depth review and assessment of two popular graph neural network (GNN)-based regional epidemic forecasting models of \textbf{EpiGNN} and \textbf{ColaGNN}, we propose a novel hybrid graph neural network model, \textbf{EpiHybridGNN}, which integrates the strengths of both EpiGNN and \textbf{ColaGNN}. In the EpiGNN, through its transmission risk encoding module and Region-Aware Graph Learner (RAGL), both multi-scale convolutions and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are combined, aiming to effectively capture spatio-temporal propagation dynamics between regions and support the integration of external resources to enhance forecasting performance. While, in the ColaGNN, a cross-location attention mechanism, multi-scale dilated convolutions, and graph message passing are utilized to address the challenges of long-term forecasting through dynamic graph structures and spatio-temporal feature fusion. Both enjoy respective advantages but also share mutual shortcomings. Our EpiHybridGNN is therefore designed to combine the advantages of both EpiGNN, in its risk encoding and RAGL, and ColaGNN, in its long-term forecasting capabilities and dynamic attention mechanisms. This helps to form a more comprehensive and robust prediction of spatio-temporal epidemic propagation. The computational architecture, core formulas and their interpretations of our proposed EpiHybridGNN are provided. Multiple numerical real data experiments validate that our EpiHybridGNN significantly outperforms both EpiGNN and ColaGNN in epidemic forecasting with comprehensive insights and references offered.

Conclusion: 提出的视觉攻击方法对MRAG有效。

Abstract: Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing, involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative, convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos. Project page: https://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com

Result: CNN架构DoubleU - Net取得最高的Dice系数、mIoU和精度，前3名结果均由CNN架构获得，Mamba和Transformer架构因数据有限和空间先验较弱表现不佳。

Conclusion: 在特定领域医学图像分割中，架构与任务的匹配比模型复杂性更重要。

Abstract: Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

Motivation: 为CAD边界表示（B - Rep）找到更好的几何表示方法，提高CAD模型生成的成功率。

Method: 将CAD模型表面网格几何编码为有符号距离函数（SDF），B - Rep顶点、边、面及其拓扑信息编码为逐面无符号距离函数（UDFs），用改进的Marching Cubes算法转换BR - DF为B - Rep模型，提出基于3D U - Net骨干的多分支潜在扩散模型生成BR - DF模型的SDF和逐面UDFs。

Result: CAD生成性能与SOTA方法相当，生成（多面）B - Rep模型成功率达100%。

Conclusion: BR - DF是一种有效的CAD B - Rep几何表示，所提方法在CAD生成中表现良好且能保证B - Rep模型生成成功率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel geometric representation for CAD Boundary Representation (B-Rep) based on volumetric distance functions, dubbed B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF). BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.

TL;DR: 提出新型皮肤病视觉语言模型SkinR1，结合推理与强化学习解决现有模型问题，实验显示其诊断准确率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在皮肤病诊断中的可信度和临床实用性受数据异质性、缺乏诊断依据和可扩展性与泛化性有限等因素限制。

Method: 设计基于教科书的推理生成器提供监督，利用构建的轨迹进行有监督微调，开发结合疾病层次结构的强化学习范式。

Result: 在多个皮肤病数据集上的实验表明SkinR1诊断准确率高，消融研究证明有监督微调对推理基础的重要性。

Conclusion: SkinR1有效解决了现有视觉语言模型在皮肤病诊断中的局限，提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.
  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.

Conclusion: 该方法对制造业可持续发展有重要贡献。

Abstract: This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体感知是计算机视觉难题，现有多任务学习框架存在负交叉任务交互影响性能。

Method: 引入EGSA融合机制，将边界信息融入语义和几何特征融合；提出多模态渐进训练策略，学习从RGB图像边缘过渡到预测深度图像边缘。

Result: 在Syn - TODD和ClearPose基准上，EGSA比当前最优方法（MODEST）持续提高深度精度，保持有竞争力的分割性能，在透明区域改进最大。

Conclusion: 边缘引导融合是一种能改善透明物体感知的稳健方法。

Abstract: Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.

Conclusion: 提出的特征知识蒸馏框架有效，代码开源利于后续研究。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) methods can transfer knowledge of a parameter-heavy teacher model to a light-weight student model. The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches. We publically share our code to facilitate future work at https://github.com/Thegolfingocto/KD_wo_CE.

The framework comprises three core line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite - a line-up of 6B parameter image generation models, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite - a fast and lightweight 2B parameter text-to-video and image-to-video models, and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro - 19B parameter models that achieves superior video generation quality. We provide a comprehensive review of the data curation lifecycle - including collection, processing, filtering and clustering - for the multi-stage training pipeline that involves extensive pre-training and incorporates quality-enhancement techniques such as self-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. We also present novel architectural, training, and inference optimizations that enable Kandinsky 5.0 to achieve high generation speeds and state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, as demonstrated by human evaluation. As a large-scale, publicly available generative framework, Kandinsky 5.0 leverages the full potential of its pre-training and subsequent stages to be adapted for a wide range of generative applications. We hope that this report, together with the release of our open-source code and training checkpoints, will substantially advance the development and accessibility of high-quality generative models for the research community.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督单图像双向MRI合成器有效且前向模型鲁棒。

Abstract: We present an unsupervised single image bidirectional Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) synthesizer that synthesizes an Ultra-Low Field (ULF) like image from a High-Field (HF) magnitude image and vice-versa. Unlike existing MRI synthesis models, our approach is inspired by the physics that drives contrast changes between HF and ULF MRIs. Our forward model simulates a HF to ULF transformation by estimating the tissue-type Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values based on target contrast values. For the Super-Resolution task, we used an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to synthesize HF image by simultaneously predicting tissue-type segmentations and image intensity without observed HF data. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments. WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated the robustness of our forward model to variations in target contrast, noise and initial seeding.

Abstract: In the field of human-object interaction (HOI), detection and generation are two dual tasks that have traditionally been addressed separately, hindering the development of comprehensive interaction understanding. To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.

Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 在大规模预训练网络时代，紧凑的特定任务架构至关重要。

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging analyses for clinical diagnosis are often constrained by compromises in spatiotemporal fidelity and by the limited adaptability of large-scale, general-purpose models. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Spatiotemporal Encoding (DCL-SE), an end-to-end framework centered on data-driven spatiotemporal encoding (DaSE). We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. These findings underscore the critical importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.

Abstract: We propose a new hologram representation based on structured complex-valued 2D Gaussian primitives, which replaces per-pixel information storage and reduces the parameter search space by up to 10:1. To enable end-to-end training, we develop a differentiable rasterizer for our representation, integrated with a GPU-optimized light propagation kernel in free space. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to 2.5x lower VRAM usage and 50% faster optimization while producing higher-fidelity reconstructions than existing methods. We further introduce a conversion procedure that adapts our representation to practical hologram formats, including smooth and random phase-only holograms. Our experiments show that this procedure can effectively suppress noise artifacts observed in previous methods. By reducing the hologram parameter search space, our representation enables a more scalable hologram estimation in the next-generation computer-generated holography systems.

Abstract: High-quality intraoperative feedback from a surgical trainer is pivotal for improving trainee performance and long-term skill acquisition. Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.

Conclusion: SEC - Depth框架有效解决了恶劣天气下自监督深度估计性能下降问题，提升了方法鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.

Abstract: Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.

Abstract: Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.

Abstract: Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.

Abstract: Object detection with 3D radar is essential for 360-degree automotive perception, but radar's long wavelengths produce sparse and irregular reflections that challenge traditional grid and sequence-based convolutional and transformer detectors. This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.

Conclusion: IPTQ - ViT是一种有效的全整数视觉Transformer后训练量化方法，无需重新训练，性能良好，代码将公开。

Abstract: Previous Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods for vision transformers rely on expensive retraining to recover accuracy loss in non-linear layer quantization, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments. In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\%p (avg. 1.78\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods. We plan to release our code https://github.com/gihwan-kim/IPTQ-ViT.git.

Abstract: Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.

Conclusion: D4C有效弥合了无数据量化在CLIP上的性能差距，是适用于CLIP的有效无数据量化框架。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.

Motivation: 现有方法在将HE切片与对应ST图谱对齐时采用单尺度，忽略细粒度细胞结构及其空间组织。

Method: 提出Sigmma框架，引入多尺度对比对齐，将细胞相互作用表示为图并整合子图内外关系。

Result: Sigmma学习的表示能更好捕捉跨模态对应关系，基因表达预测任务平均提升9.78%，跨模态检索任务平均提升26.93%。

Conclusion: Sigmma能学习有意义的多组织结构用于下游分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.

Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.

Abstract: Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

Conclusion: MILL数据集可全面评估增强算法，提出的改进方法能增强在不同光照场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imaging in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced scene radiance, which leads to elevated sensor noise and reduced color saturation. Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.

Conclusion: 所提出的HASTEN方法通过维护层次关系有效抵抗遗忘，在类增量学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: CompTrack能有效消除点云双重冗余，实现高性能和高效率的3D单目标跟踪。

Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild. The dataset is available at $\href{https://www.conservationxlabs.com/sa-fari}{\text{conservationxlabs.com/SA-FARI}}$.

TL;DR: GEO - Bench - 2提出综合框架评估地理空间基础模型，实验表明无单一模型在所有任务占优，模型选择依赖任务等因素，成果公开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间基础模型评估缺乏标准化协议，需改进。

Method: 提出综合框架，涵盖多种任务和19个许可数据集；引入“能力”组排名模型；定义评估协议。

Result: 无单一模型在所有任务占优，自然图像预训练模型在高分辨率任务表现好，特定EO模型在多光谱应用表现好。

Conclusion: 最佳模型选择取决于任务要求等因素，单一通用GeoFM待研究，GEO - Bench - 2可实现针对特定用例的评估，代码等成果公开。

Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.
  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的模型关注低频信息存在局限性，需要能利用高低频信号的模型来准确检测抑郁。

Method: 提出Multi - Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF - GCN)，包含Multi - Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM) 以利用高低频信号。

Result: 在二分类和三分类任务中，MF - GCN的各项指标优于传统机器学习算法和深度学习框架；在CMDC数据集上也取得良好表现。

Conclusion: 三模态、多频率框架能有效捕捉跨模态交互，实现准确的抑郁检测。

Abstract: Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary (depressed and non depressed) classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class (no depression, mild to moderate depression and severe depression) classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.

Motivation: 前沿基础模型如GPT - 5和Grok 4在从少量示例进行抽象推理方面存在问题，ARC - AGI可测试此能力，而现有方法存在缺陷，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出视觉和语言在推理不同阶段优势互补的假设，引入Vision - Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR) 和Modality - Switch Self - Correction (MSSC) 两种策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种旗舰模型和ARC - AGI任务上比仅基于文本的基线方法提升了4.33%。

Conclusion: 统一视觉抽象和语言推理是未来基础模型实现通用类人智能的关键一步。

Abstract: Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models. Source code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编译方法缺乏对多PIM后端的ML内核系统优化，且忽视数据重排与计算代码优化的相互依赖。

Method: 设计DCC，集成多层PIM抽象，将数据分区策略映射到计算循环分区，应用PIM特定代码优化，利用性能预测模型选择最优配置。

Result: 在多种ML内核中，DCC在HBM - PIM和AttAcc PIM后端相比仅GPU执行有显著加速；在端到端LLM推理中，DCC在AttAcc上加速GPT - 3和LLaMA - 2。

Conclusion: DCC能有效联合优化数据重排和计算代码，提升PIM系统性能。

Abstract: Processing-In-Memory (PIM) devices integrated with high-performance Host processors (e.g., GPUs) can accelerate memory-intensive kernels in Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by leveraging high memory bandwidth at PIM cores. However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种新的绿色洗绿度量方法，揭示污染企业如何利用社交媒体广告转移批评。

Method: 结合大语言模型、人工编码和贝叶斯项目反应理论的测量技术，分析Meta广告目标数据集里的1100万条社会政治广告。

Result: 洗绿行为主体和组成多样，发现政治洗绿现象，大量广告通过与化石燃料行业有未披露关联的组织投放，洗绿广告微目标定位左倾化石燃料资产社区，国家级舆论影响广告较少。

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法可识别洗绿行为，揭示了洗绿广告的投放特点和政治洗绿现象。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel measure for greenwashing -- i.e., climate-related misinformation -- that shows how polluting companies can use social media advertising related to climate change to redirect criticism. To do so, we identify greenwashing content in 11 million social-political ads in Meta's Ad Targeting Datset with a measurement technique that combines large language models, human coders, and advances in Bayesian item response theory. We show that what is called greenwashing has diverse actors and components, but we also identify a very pernicious form, which we call political greenwashing, that appears to be promoted by fossil fuel companies and related interest groups. Based on ad targeting data, we show that much of this advertising happens via organizations with undisclosed links to the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, we show that greenwashing ad content is being micro-targeted at left-leaning communities with fossil fuel assets, though we also find comparatively little evidence of ad targeting aimed at influencing public opinion at the national level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放比赛具有高度动态和长序列特性，战术空间随序列推进呈指数增长，使自动战术发现极具挑战，需辅助教练和分析师进行战术决策。

Method: 提出TacEleven框架，包含语言控制的战术生成器和基于多模态大语言模型的战术评估器，通过定量指标和基于问卷的定性评估在三个不同战术复杂度任务中进行评估。

Result: TacEleven发现的战术具有强现实性和战术创造性，多步战术替代方案中有52.50%在现实精英足球场景中被认为可采用。

Conclusion: TacEleven展示了创造性利用领域数据和生成模型推动体育战术分析的潜力。

Abstract: Creating offensive advantages during open play is fundamental to football success. However, due to the highly dynamic and long-sequence nature of open play, the potential tactic space grows exponentially as the sequence progresses, making automated tactic discovery extremely challenging. To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations. TacEleven demonstrates the potential of creatively leveraging domain data and generative models to advance tactical analysis in sports.

Method: 提出基于图神经网络的资源预测框架，将项目活动网络表示与图神经网络结合，用异构活动 - 资源图表示项目，评估多种学习范式。

Result: 相比传统回归和树基方法，平均绝对误差降低 23% - 31%，决定系数 R2 从约 0.78 提升到 0.91。

Conclusion: 该框架效果好，且学习嵌入能提供资源瓶颈和关键依赖的可解释见解，利于调度决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of project duration and cost remains one of the most challenging aspects of project management, particularly in resource-constrained and interdependent task networks. Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies.
  We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks. Furthermore, the learned embeddings provide interpretable insights into resource bottlenecks and critical dependencies, enabling more explainable and adaptive scheduling decisions.

Conclusion: 神经适应可解决关键的时间问题，实现动态环境中的高效学习。

Abstract: Working memory requires the brain to maintain information from the recent past to guide ongoing behavior. Neurons can contribute to this capacity by slowly integrating their inputs over time, creating persistent activity that outlasts the original stimulus. However, when these slowly integrating neurons are organized hierarchically, they introduce cumulative delays that create a fundamental challenge for learning: teaching signals that indicate whether behavior was correct or incorrect arrive out-of-sync with the neural activity they are meant to instruct. Here, we demonstrate that neurons enhanced with an adaptive current can compensate for these delays by responding to external stimuli prospectively -- effectively predicting future inputs to synchronize with them. First, we show that such prospective neurons enable teaching signal synchronization across a range of learning algorithms that propagate error signals through hierarchical networks. Second, we demonstrate that this successfully guides learning in slowly integrating neurons, enabling the formation and retrieval of memories over extended timescales. We support our findings with a mathematical analysis of the prospective coding mechanism and learning experiments on motor control tasks. Together, our results reveal how neural adaptation could solve a critical timing problem and enable efficient learning in dynamic environments.

Method: 对MELD和IEMOCAP数据集实施质量控制流程，利用说话人和人脸识别的迁移学习，使用RecoMadeEasy(R)引擎提取嵌入，微调MPNet - v2，通过特定情感的MLP调整特征，采用基于MAMBA的三模态融合。

Result: 在MELD上准确率达64.8%，在IEMOCAP上达74.3%。

Conclusion: 在质量控制的数据子集上结合基于身份的音频和视觉嵌入与情感调整的文本表示，能为对话多模态情感识别带来有竞争力的表现，并为改进低频情感类别提供基础。

Abstract: This paper addresses data quality issues in multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) through systematic quality control and multi-stage transfer learning. We implement a quality control pipeline for MELD and IEMOCAP datasets that validates speaker identity, audio-text alignment, and face detection. We leverage transfer learning from speaker and face recognition, assuming that identity-discriminative embeddings capture not only stable acoustic and Facial traits but also person-specific patterns of emotional expression. We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.

Method: 引入参数期权校准中选择性遗忘（机器遗忘）的原则性框架。

Result: 提供稳定性保证、扰动边界，证明所提操作符在标准正则性假设下满足局部精确性。

Conclusion: 所提框架可解决现有系统在移除数据时的不足。

Abstract: Calibration of option pricing models is routinely repeated as markets evolve, yet modern systems lack an operator for removing data from a calibrated model without full retraining. When quotes become stale, corrupted, or subject to deletion requirements, existing calibration pipelines must rebuild the entire nonlinear least-squares problem, even if only a small subset of data must be excluded. In this work, we introduce a principled framework for selective forgetting (machine unlearning) in parametric option calibration. We provide stability guarantees, perturbation bounds, and show that the proposed operators satisfy local exactness under standard regularity assumptions.

Conclusion: BaGGLS是揭示生物相关交互模式的有前景方法，在计算生物学高维任务中有潜在应用。

Abstract: Biological data sets are often high-dimensional, noisy, and governed by complex interactions among sparse signals. This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection. Tasks such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet their black-box nature limits interpretability. We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms. This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces. In extensive simulations, we can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns, with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拉地毯攻击检测器假设不符合实际情况，许多真实攻击通过时间和参与者维度分散攻击，需要新的研究。

Method: 将此类攻击形式化为FRP，定义三个原子谓词组，通过正交组合得出规避策略，并进行大规模测量验证。

Result: 语料库含303,614个LP，105,434个为FRP池，检测到大量相关交易、钱包，FRP标记LP中所有者钱包参与虚高抛售比例大幅下降，发现127,252个连环诈骗钱包。

Conclusion: 定义的规避策略广泛存在且具有操作意义。

Abstract: Existing rug pull detectors assume a simple workflow: the deployer keeps liquidity pool (LP) tokens and performs one or a few large sells (within a day) that collapse the pool and cash out. In practice, however, many real-world exits violate these assumptions by splitting the attack across both time and actor dimensions: attackers break total extraction into many low-impact trades and route proceeds through multiple non-owner addresses, producing low-visibility drains.
  We formalize this family of attacks as the fragmented rug pull (FRP) and offer a compact recipe for a slow-stewed beef special: (i) keep the lid on (to preserve LP control so on-chain extraction remains feasible), (ii) chop thin slices (to split the total exit volume into many low-impact micro-trades that individually fall below impact thresholds), and (iii) pass the ladle (to delegate sells across multiple wallets so that each participant takes a small share of the extraction). Technically, we define three atomic predicate groups and show that their orthogonal combinations yield evasive strategies overlooked by prior heuristics (USENIX Sec 19, USENIX Sec 23).
  We validate the model with large-scale measurements. Our corpus contains 303,614 LPs, among which 105,434 are labeled as FRP pools. The labeled subset includes 34,192,767 pool-related transactions and 401,838 inflated-seller wallets, involving 1,501,408 unique interacting addresses. Notably, owner-wallet participation in inflated selling among FRP-flagged LPs has declined substantially (33.1% of cases), indicating a shift in scam behavior: the liquidity drain is no longer held on the owner wallet. We also detected 127,252 wallets acting as serial scammers when repeatedly engaging in inflated selling across multiple FRP LPs. Our empirical findings demonstrate that the evasive strategies we define are widespread and operationally significant.

Result: 通过实际案例评估，GeoShield在有效性和资源效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个在不可靠网络下无需依赖可信硬件有效运行的有界时间恢复方案。

Abstract: Large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as railway control systems and smart grids, consist of geographically distributed subsystems that are connected via unreliable, asynchronous inter-region networks. Their scale and distribution make them especially vulnerable to faults and attacks. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerant methods either consume excessive resources or provide only eventual guarantees, making them unsuitable for real-time resource-constrained CPS.
  We present GeoShield, a resource-efficient solution for defending geo-distributed CPS against Byzantine faults. GeoShield leverages the property that CPS are designed to tolerate brief disruptions and maintain safety, as long as they recover (i.e., resume normal operations or transition to a safe mode) within a bounded amount of time following a fault. Instead of masking faults, it detects them and recovers the system within bounded time, thus guaranteeing safety with much fewer resources. GeoShield introduces protocols for Byzantine fault-resilient network measurement and inter-region omission fault detection that proactively detect malicious message delays, along with recovery mechanisms that guarantee timely recovery while maximizing operational robustness. It is the first bounded-time recovery solution that operates effectively under unreliable networks without relying on trusted hardware. Evaluations using real-world case studies show that it significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and resource efficiency.

Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.

Motivation: 软件定义汽车中安全软件更新至关重要，此前对UniSUF的评估未采用形式化验证方法，需弥补这一空白。

Method: 对UniSUF的架构和假设建模以反映现实汽车系统，开发基于ProVerif的框架，通过符号执行验证其是否符合安全要求。

Result: 结果表明UniSUF符合指定的安全保证。

Conclusion: UniSUF的安全框架具有正确性和可靠性。

Abstract: With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures.
  Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出块同步器概念，设计Beluga实例，集成到Sui区块链共识核心Mysticeti中，表现优于先前设计并被采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BFT共识协议缺乏高效块交换方式，易受攻击且在网络异步时性能崩溃。

Method: 引入块同步器概念，设计模块化且考虑稀缺性的Beluga实例并集成到Mysticeti。

Result: 在地理分布式AWS部署中，Beluga在乐观路径维持最优性能，受攻击时吞吐量最高提高3倍，延迟降低25倍。

Conclusion: Beluga能在常见情况实现最优延迟，限制故障和对抗行为下恢复成本，已被Sui区块链在生产中采用。

Abstract: Modern high-throughput BFT consensus protocols use streamlined push-pull mechanisms to disseminate blocks and keep happy-path performance optimal. Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.

Conclusion: 评估了对抗样本对自动驾驶系统攻击的效果，指出部分驾驶代理模块可抵御攻击。

Abstract: To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.
  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.
  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.

Conclusion: 该方法可解决AI部署的监管、安全和问责挑战，为大规模可信AI系统提供可行途径。

Abstract: The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced unprecedented security challenges, particularly in phishing detection within academic environments. Academic institutions and researchers are high-value targets, facing dynamic, multilingual, and context-dependent threats that leverage research backgrounds, academic collaborations, and personal information to craft highly tailored attacks. Existing security benchmarks largely rely on datasets that do not incorporate specific academic background information, making them inadequate for capturing the evolving attack patterns and human-centric vulnerability factors specific to academia. To address this gap, we present AdapT-Bench, a unified methodological framework and benchmark suite for systematically evaluating MLLM defense capabilities against dynamic phishing attacks in academic settings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with function-calling capabilities are increasingly deployed, but remain vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks that hijack their tool calls. In response, numerous IPI-centric defense frameworks have emerged. However, these defenses are fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses. Our paper provides a foundation and critical insights for the future development of more secure and usable IPI-centric agent defense frameworks.

Abstract: Phishing websites pose a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting unsuspecting users and causing significant financial and organisational harm. Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.

We further show that the contribution of several components is correlated with protein length. These findings provide insight into how OpenFold achieves accurate predictions and highlight directions for interpreting protein prediction networks more broadly.

Conclusion: 发布的Rebeca和ROS2代码可作为建模多自主机器人系统的基础。

Abstract: Model-based development enables quicker prototyping, earlier experimentation and validation of design intents. For a multi-agent system with complex asynchronous interactions and concurrency, formal verification, model-checking in particular, offers an automated mechanism for verifying desired properties. Timed Rebeca is an actor-based modelling language supporting reactive, concurrent and time semantics, accompanied with a model-checking compiler. These capabilities allow using Timed Rebeca to correctly model ROS2 node topographies, recurring physical signals, motion primitives and other timed and time-convertible behaviors. The biggest challenges in modelling and verifying a multi-robot system lie in abstracting complex information, bridging the gap between a discrete model and a continuous system and compacting the state space, while maintaining the model's accuracy. We develop different discretization strategies for different kinds of information, identifying the 'enough' thresholds of abstraction, and applying efficient optimization techniques to boost computations. With this work we demonstrate how to use models to design and verify a multi-robot system, how to discretely model a continuous system to do model-checking efficiently, and the round-trip engineering flow between the model and the implementation. The released Rebeca and ROS2 codes can serve as a foundation for modelling multiple autonomous robots systems.

Conclusion: SVBRD - LLM框架能有效从真实交通视频中发现可解释的自动驾驶车辆行为规则，具有较高准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: As more autonomous vehicles operate on public roads, understanding real-world behavior of autonomous vehicles is critical to analyzing traffic safety, making policies, and public acceptance. This paper proposes SVBRD-LLM, a framework that automatically discovers, verifies, and applies interpretable behavioral rules from real traffic videos through zero-shot prompt engineering. The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.

Result: 在CNN和Transformer架构下的多种机器人操作任务中，Eq.Bot优于现有方法，最大提升达50.0%。

Conclusion: Eq.Bot作为模型无关的解决方案，能有效赋予模型空间等变性，有更好的性能。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.

Conclusion: 两种方法在动态、不断发展的机器人系统中有各自的操作优势。

Abstract: This paper compares two distinct approaches to modeling robotic behavior: imperative Behavior Trees (BTs) and declarative Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework. BTs structure behavior hierarchically using control-flow, whereas EO represents the domain as a temporal, event-based semantic graph driven by dataflow rules. We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios. The comparison is grounded in a practical mobile manipulation task. This comparison highlights the respective operational strengths of each approach in dynamic, evolving robotic systems.

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in intelligent transportation and robotics, where obstacles and conditions change over time, introducing uncertainty and requiring continuous adaptation. While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.

Abstract: We investigate the sampling-based optimal path planning problem for robotics in complex and dynamic environments. Most existing sampling-based algorithms neglect environmental information or the information from previous samples. Yet, these pieces of information are highly informative, as leveraging them can provide better heuristics when sampling the next state. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based planning algorithm, called \emph{RRT*former}, which integrates the standard RRT* algorithm with a Transformer network in a novel way. Specifically, the Transformer is used to extract features from the environment and leverage information from previous samples to better guide the sampling process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency. The code for our implementation is available on https://github.com/fengmingyang666/RRTformer.

Motivation: 水下自主航行器团队依赖声学通信进行协调，但该通信方式存在局限性，需实时了解通信环境以应对不确定性。

Method: 将其作为分散分类问题，AUV共享部分通信测量数据构建地图，并提出严格推导的数据共享策略。

Result: 使用弗吉尼亚理工大学690型AUV团队收集的真实声学通信数据进行实验，验证了共享策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据共享策略在水下环境中是有效的。

Abstract: Teams of cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) rely on acoustic communication for coordination, yet this communication medium is constrained by limited range, multi-path effects, and low bandwidth. One way to address the uncertainty associated with acoustic communication is to learn the communication environment in real-time. We address the challenge of a team of robots building a map of the probability of communication success from one location to another in real-time. This is a decentralized classification problem -- communication events are either successful or unsuccessful -- where AUVs share a subset of their communication measurements to build the map. The main contribution of this work is a rigorously derived data sharing policy that selects measurements to be shared among AUVs. We experimentally validate our proposed sharing policy using real acoustic communication data collected from teams of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs, demonstrating its effectiveness in underwater environments.

Conclusion: 部分执行去噪过程的方法可行，能为实时应用提供解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Policy has shown great performance in robotic manipulation tasks under stochastic perturbations, due to its ability to model multimodal action distributions. Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled. The contribution of this work gives a framework for faster imitation learning and a metric that yields if a controller will be stable based on the variance of the demonstrations.

Abstract: The integration of advanced robotics in nuclear power plants (NPPs) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental monitoring in high-stakes environments. Our paper introduces the Optimus-Q robot, a sophisticated system designed to autonomously monitor air quality and detect contamination while leveraging adaptive learning techniques and secure quantum communication. Equipped with advanced infrared sensors, the Optimus-Q robot continuously streams real-time environmental data to predict hazardous gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH$_4$). Utilizing a federated learning approach, the robot collaborates with other systems across various NPPs to improve its predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy. Additionally, the implementation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive operational information. Our methodology combines systematic navigation patterns with machine learning algorithms to facilitate efficient coverage of designated areas, thereby optimizing contamination monitoring processes. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Optimus-Q robot in enhancing operational safety and responsiveness in nuclear facilities. This research underscores the potential of integrating robotics, machine learning, and quantum technologies to revolutionize monitoring systems in hazardous environments.

Conclusion: 提出的收集和使用以自我为中心数据的方法有效，能挖掘数据潜力，使策略具备多种新特性。

Abstract: Egocentric videos are a valuable and scalable data source to learn manipulation policies. However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估哪种法律分类能使AI系统的长期法律一致性最大化。

Method: 分析三种AI系统法律分类选项（物体分类、虚构法律人格、非虚构法律人格）的含义和影响，考虑多方面法律问题。

Result: 非虚构人格方法从一致性角度可能最佳，物体分类对现有系统足够，虚构人格有缺陷，混合方法会导致不一致。

Conclusion: 在物体、虚构人格和非虚构人格分类中必须做出选择。

Abstract: The law draws a sharp distinction between objects and persons, and between two kinds of persons, the ''fictional'' kind (i.e. corporations), and the ''non-fictional'' kind (individual or ''natural'' persons). This paper will assess whether we maximize overall long-term legal coherence by (A) maintaining an object classification for all future AI systems, (B) creating fictional legal persons associated with suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (giving these fictional legal persons derogable rights and duties associated with certified groups of existing persons, potentially including free speech, contract rights, and standing to sue ''on behalf of'' the AI system), or (C) recognizing non-fictional legal personhood through legal identity for suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (recognizing them as entities meriting legal standing with non-derogable rights which for the human case include life, due process, habeas corpus, freedom from slavery, and freedom of conscience). We will clarify the meaning and implications of each option along the way, considering liability, copyright, family law, fundamental rights, civil rights, citizenship, and AI safety regulation. We will tentatively find that the non-fictional personhood approach may be best from a coherence perspective, for at least some advanced AI systems. An object approach may prove untenable for sufficiently humanoid advanced systems, though we suggest that it is adequate for currently existing systems as of 2025. While fictional personhood would resolve some coherence issues for future systems, it would create others and provide solutions that are neither durable nor fit for purpose. Finally, our review will suggest that ''hybrid'' approaches are likely to fail and lead to further incoherence: the choice between object, fictional person and non-fictional person is unavoidable.

Abstract: Peer review is a cornerstone of scientific publishing, including at premier machine learning conferences such as ICLR. As submission volumes increase, understanding the nature and dynamics of the review process is crucial for improving its efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of published papers. We present a large-scale analysis of the ICLR 2024 and 2025 peer review processes, focusing on before- and after-rebuttal scores and reviewer-author interactions. We examine review scores, author-reviewer engagement, temporal patterns in review submissions, and co-reviewer influence effects. Combining quantitative analyses with LLM-based categorization of review texts and rebuttal discussions, we identify common strengths and weaknesses for each rating group, as well as trends in rebuttal strategies that are most strongly associated with score changes. Our findings show that initial scores and the ratings of co-reviewers are the strongest predictors of score changes during the rebuttal, pointing to a degree of reviewer influence. Rebuttals play a valuable role in improving outcomes for borderline papers, where thoughtful author responses can meaningfully shift reviewer perspectives. More broadly, our study offers evidence-based insights to improve the peer review process, guiding authors on effective rebuttal strategies and helping the community design fairer and more efficient review processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物救援组织手动监测志愿者反馈繁琐，难确定重要问题，需大语言模型辅助。

Method: 与412 Food Rescue合作设计RescueLens工具，自动分类反馈、建议跟进对象和更新志愿者指引。

Result: 在标注数据集上，RescueLens能以71%精度恢复96%志愿者问题，可聚焦0.5%造成超30%问题的捐赠者。

Conclusion: RescueLens简化反馈流程，助组织者更好分配时间。

Abstract: Food rescue organizations simultaneously tackle food insecurity and waste by working with volunteers to redistribute food from donors who have excess to recipients who need it. Volunteer feedback allows food rescue organizations to identify issues early and ensure volunteer satisfaction. However, food rescue organizations monitor feedback manually, which can be cumbersome and labor-intensive, making it difficult to prioritize which issues are most important. In this work, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) assist food rescue organizers in understanding and taking action based on volunteer experiences. We work with 412 Food Rescue, a large food rescue organization based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to design RescueLens, an LLM-powered tool that automatically categorizes volunteer feedback, suggests donors and recipients to follow up with, and updates volunteer directions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of RescueLens on an annotated dataset, and show that it can recover 96% of volunteer issues at 71% precision. Moreover, by ranking donors and recipients according to their rates of volunteer issues, RescueLens allows organizers to focus on 0.5% of donors responsible for more than 30% of volunteer issues. RescueLens is now deployed at 412 Food Rescue and through semi-structured interviews with organizers, we find that RescueLens streamlines the feedback process so organizers better allocate their time.

Motivation: 理解粉丝间情绪动态和传染对影响者和营销人员很重要，但解释情绪演变的动力学模型有限。

Method: 追踪科技博主六个月，从文本挖掘反馈量化粉丝情绪，将博主受众视为“宏观主体”。

Result: 情绪轨迹遵循迭代平均原则，与观点动力学模型尤其是改进的French - DeGroot模型相符，揭示博客间因同质性产生的相互依赖。

Conclusion: 研究为理解社交媒体上粉丝情绪动态提供了新视角和理论支持。

Abstract: Online social media platforms enable influencers to distribute content and quickly capture audience reactions, significantly shaping their promotional strategies and advertising agreements. Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single "macro-agent", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are highly effective for environmental monitoring, particularly for detecting temperature variations. However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous.

Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.

Conclusion: 大数据集未必产生更好的GNN预测模型，提出了在材料信息学中高效构建高质量训练数据的简单通用策略。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.

Abstract: The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.

Abstract: Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.

Abstract: Efficient and sustainable maritime transport increasingly depends on reliable forecasting and adaptive routing, yet operational adoption remains difficult due to forecast latencies and the need for human judgment in rapid decision-making under changing ocean conditions. We introduce SWR-Viz, an AI-assisted visual analytics framework that combines a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator wave forecast model with SIMROUTE-based routing and interactive emissions analytics. The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios. We evaluate the forecast models and SWR-Viz framework along key shipping corridors in the Japan Coast and Gulf of Mexico, showing both improved forecast stability and realistic routing outcomes comparable to ground-truth reanalysis wave products. Expert feedback highlights the usability of SWR-Viz, its ability to isolate voyage segments with high emission reduction potential, and its value as a practical decision-support system. More broadly, this work illustrates how lightweight AI forecasting can be integrated with interactive visual analytics to support human-centered decision-making in complex geospatial and environmental domains.

Conclusion: AI驱动的智能体可在教育和专业场景为演示技能发展提供有吸引力、以人为本且可扩展的支持。

Abstract: Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.

Motivation: 为实现可持续发展目标7，需深入理解社会经济因素对能源系统的影响，解决量化影响、建模跨领域交互和捕捉反馈动态等问题。

Method: 引入ClimateAgents框架，结合大语言模型与领域专业代理，利用机器学习因果推理方法，基于265个经济体20年社会经济和排放数据及98个指标进行分析。

Result: 分析确定碳排放三大驱动因素：农村和城市清洁烹饪燃料获取情况、城市人口百分比。

Conclusion: 强调清洁烹饪技术和城市化模式对排放结果的关键作用，ClimateAgents支持生成可信且可行的政策见解，推动从孤立建模转向反思性、模块化系统以应对气候行动。

Abstract: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) requires not only technological innovation but also a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing energy access and carbon emissions. While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.

Result: ARGOS指标优于文献中其他模型选择指标，如二元交叉熵损失。

Conclusion: ARGOS指标在多种现实应用中对异常检测的噪声条件具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.

Conclusion: SpotlightTTS能有效提升表达性文本转语音的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose SpotlightTTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI for music have achieved remarkable fidelity and stylistic diversity, yet these systems often fail to align with nuanced human preferences due to the specific loss functions they use. This paper advocates for the systematic application of preference alignment techniques to music generation, addressing the fundamental gap between computational optimization and human musical appreciation. Drawing on recent breakthroughs including MusicRL's large-scale preference learning, multi-preference alignment frameworks like diffusion-based preference optimization in DiffRhythm+, and inference-time optimization techniques like Text2midi-InferAlign, we discuss how these techniques can address music's unique challenges: temporal coherence, harmonic consistency, and subjective quality assessment. We identify key research challenges including scalability to long-form compositions, reliability amongst others in preference modelling. Looking forward, we envision preference-aligned music generation enabling transformative applications in interactive composition tools and personalized music services. This work calls for sustained interdisciplinary research combining advances in machine learning, music-theory to create music AI systems that truly serve human creative and experiential needs.

Motivation: 探究预训练音频模型在COVID - 19检测任务中的性能。

Method: 在Coswara和COUGHVID数据集上微调Audio - MAE和三种PANN架构，按年龄和性别进行严格人口分层。

Result: 数据集内Audio - MAE在Coswara表现较好，在Coughvid表现有限；跨数据集所有模型泛化失败，Audio - MAE性能严重下降。

Conclusion: 人口平衡虽降低模型表现但能消除混淆因素，平衡后数据集样本量不足，开发可泛化音频检测系统存在挑战，严格人口控制对临床模型评估很重要。

Abstract: This technical report investigates the performance of pre-trained audio models on COVID-19 detection tasks using established benchmark datasets. We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.

Conclusion: 开发支持不同模态多样无线任务的多模态无线基础模型潜力巨大，为AI原生6G和联合感知、通信与定位愿景提供了具体步骤。

Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.

Abstract: Data-driven methods for electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are rapidly progressing. Large datasets have enabled advances in artificial intelligence (AI) based ECG analysis, yet limitations in annotation quality, size, and scope remain major challenges. Here we present CODE-II, a large-scale real-world dataset of 2,735,269 12-lead ECGs from 2,093,807 adult patients collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), Brazil. Each exam was annotated using standardized diagnostic criteria and reviewed by cardiologists. A defining feature of CODE-II is a set of 66 clinically meaningful diagnostic classes, developed with cardiologist input and routinely used in telehealth practice. We additionally provide an open available subset: CODE-II-open, a public subset of 15,000 patients, and the CODE-II-test, a non-overlapping set of 8,475 exams reviewed by multiple cardiologists for blinded evaluation. A neural network pre-trained on CODE-II achieved superior transfer performance on external benchmarks (PTB-XL and CPSC 2018) and outperformed alternatives trained on larger datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的JSCCM方案在token通信中表现良好，能实现高效可靠的token传输。

Abstract: In recent years, the Transformer architecture has achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and modalities. Token is the unified input and output representation in Transformer-based models, which has become a fundamental information unit. In this work, we consider the problem of token communication, studying how to transmit tokens efficiently and reliably. Point cloud, a prevailing three-dimensional format which exhibits a more complex spatial structure compared to image or video, is chosen to be the information source. We utilize the set abstraction method to obtain point tokens. Subsequently, to get a more informative and transmission-friendly representation based on tokens, we propose a joint semantic-channel and modulation (JSCCM) scheme for the token encoder, mapping point tokens to standard digital constellation points (modulated tokens). Specifically, the JSCCM consists of two parallel Point Transformer-based encoders and a differential modulator which combines the Gumel-softmax and soft quantization methods. Besides, the rate allocator and channel adapter are developed, facilitating adaptive generation of high-quality modulated tokens conditioned on both semantic information and channel conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both joint semantic-channel coding and traditional separate coding, achieving over 1dB gain in reconstruction and more than 6x compression ratio in modulated symbols.

Method: 通过社会技术框架从技术、经济、政策和社会四个维度审查悖论，进行跨国比较。

Result: 技术可行性已确立，但大规模实施受充电协议标准、商业模式、监管和社会公平等因素限制，存在路径依赖。

Conclusion: 推进SolarEV城市需转向协调政策框架、互操作数字基础设施和包容性市场设计，多方协作构建城市能源系统。

Abstract: Urban decarbonization is central to meeting global climate goals, yet progress toward integrated low-carbon energy systems remains slow. The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably. Achieving this integrated energy transition will require strategic collaboration among researchers, governments, industries, and communities to build adaptive, resilient, and socially just urban energy systems.

Conclusion: 灵活性价值动态变化，根据负荷特性和激励措施估算节约情况可用于新系统设计、选址策略等。

Abstract: Load shifting by commercial and industrial power consumers reduces costs and Scope 2 emissions for the consumer and the grid. Incentivizing this behavior requires tools for valuing flexibility amidst the heterogeneity in load characteristics across diverse sectors and the spatiotemporal variation in electricity prices and emissions factors. This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility.

Conclusion: NAMeGEn框架在中文婴儿取名这一短文本创意自然语言生成任务中有效可行，能解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.

Method: 构建适应航空MRO环境的合规检索系统，利用ATA章节层次结构构建抗修订嵌入，用视觉语言解析结构化认证内容。

Result: 49k合成查询检索准确率超90%；10名持照AMT双语对照研究中，前10成功率90.9%，查找时间从6 - 15分钟降至18秒，减少95%。

Conclusion: 语义检索可在严格监管约束下运行，能有效减轻实际多语言MRO工作流程操作工作量。

Abstract: Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, a documented efficiency bottleneck in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources. We present a compliance-preserving retrieval system that adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to aviation MRO environments by operating alongside, rather than replacing, certified legacy viewers. The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task. These gains provide concrete evidence that semantic retrieval can operate within strict regulatory constraints and meaningfully reduce operational workload in real-world multilingual MRO workflows.

Conclusion: 研究为多语言迁移提供新见解，证明LiveCLKTBench作为可靠基准的价值。

Abstract: Evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models is challenging, as correct answers in a target language may arise either from genuine transfer or from prior exposure during pre-training. We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.

Conclusion: 提出的混合模型在情感分析中表现出色，能更好地处理上下文细微差别、可扩展性和类别不平衡问题，具有更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding customer attitudes has become a critical component of decision-making due to the growing influence of social media and e-commerce. Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis. Most of the existing methods, which include lexicon-based approaches and traditional machine learning techniques, are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification. Furthermore, the model diminished misclassification loss from 20.24% for unbalanced to 13.3% for balanced dataset, signifying enhanced generalization and resilience.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful linguistic engines but remain susceptible to hallucinations: plausible-sounding outputs that are factually incorrect or unsupported. In this work, we present a mathematically grounded framework to understand, measure, and mitigate these hallucinations. Drawing on probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation, we analyze how errors compound autoregressively, propose refined uncertainty metrics, including semantic and phase-aware variants, and develop principled mitigation strategies such as contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention. This unified lens connects recent advances in calibration, retrieval, and alignment to support safer and more reliable LLMs.

Conclusion: HTP是简单、与架构无关的方法，能增强零样本和微调模型，可扩展地提升长文档嵌入效果。

Abstract: Large language models produce powerful text embeddings, but their causal attention mechanism restricts the flow of information from later to earlier tokens, degrading representation quality. While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.

Conclusion: 在基于大语言模型的辅导系统中，对时间遗忘和学习者画像进行建模十分重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.

Motivation: 目前内在维度（ID）在大语言模型分析中很重要，但文本决定因素研究不足，因此开展综合研究。

Method: 通过交叉编码器分析、语言特征和稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）进行研究。

Result: 1. ID与基于熵的指标互补；2. ID具有体裁分层现象，科学散文ID低，百科内容中等，创意/观点写作ID高；3. 确定因果特征，科学信号降低ID，人性化信号增加ID。

Conclusion: 对于当代模型，科学写作相对‘简单’，小说、观点和情感增加表征自由度，研究为正确使用和解释基于ID的结果提供实用指导。

Abstract: Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text "representationally simple" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively "easy", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.

Abstract: With nearly 1.5 billion people and more than 120 major languages, India represents one of the most diverse regions in the world. As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding.

Result: 在MTSamples和VAERS数据集上，OEMA实现了最先进的精确匹配性能，相关匹配下与监督式BioClinicalBERT相当并超越CRF。

Conclusion: OEMA通过本体引导推理和多智能体协作解决关键零样本NER挑战，实现接近监督式的性能，对临床NLP应用有前景。

Abstract: Clinical named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs), but supervised models like CRF and BioClinicalBERT require costly annotated data. While zero-shot NER with large language models (LLMs) reduces this dependency, it struggles with example selection granularity and integrating prompts with self-improvement. To address this, we propose OEMA, a zero-shot clinical NER framework using multi-agent collaboration. OEMA's three components are: a self-annotator generating examples, a discriminator filtering them via SNOMED CT, and a predictor using entity descriptions for accurate inference. On MTSamples and VAERS datasets, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match performance. Under related-match, it matches supervised BioClinicalBERT and surpasses CRF. OEMA addresses key zero-shot NER challenges through ontology-guided reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, achieving near-supervised performance and showing promise for clinical NLP applications.

Conclusion: 风格变化可绕过当代安全机制，当前对齐方法和评估协议存在根本局限。

Abstract: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: DEPO方法能有效提升大语言模型代理的效率和性能，且有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their reasoning and decision-making abilities when deployed as agents. Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO.

We presented a novel training approach using Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic Common Label Set (CLS) as intermediate representation. It improved the performance over the baseline (in the CLS space). We also discuss various methods used to retain the gain obtained in the phonemic space while converting them back to the corresponding grapheme representations. Our systems beat the baseline in 3 languages (Track 2) in terms of WER/CER and achieved the highest language ID and dialect ID accuracy among all participating teams (Track 2).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.

Abstract: Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

Abstract: Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics enables mapping of gene expression within its native tissue context, but current platforms measure only a limited set of genes due to experimental constraints and excessive costs. To overcome this, computational models integrate Single-Cell RNA Sequencing data with Spatial Transcriptomics to predict unmeasured genes. We propose CASPER, a cross-attention based framework that predicts unmeasured gene expression in Spatial Transcriptomics by leveraging centroid-level representations from Single-Cell RNA Sequencing. We performed rigorous testing over four state-of-the-art Spatial Transcriptomics/Single-Cell RNA Sequencing dataset pairs across four existing baseline models. CASPER shows significant improvement in nine out of the twelve metrics for our experiments. This work paves the way for further work in Spatial Transcriptomics to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing modality translation. The code for CASPER is available at https://github.com/AI4Med-Lab/CASPER.

Abstract: In this report, we document patterns of Claude usage over time, in 150+ countries, across US states, and among businesses deploying Claude through the API. Based on a privacy-preserving analysis of 1 million conversations on Claude.ai and 1 million API transcripts, we have four key findings: (1) Users increasingly entrust Claude with more autonomy, with directive task delegation rising from 27% to 39% in the past eight months. (2) Claude usage is geographically concentrated with high income countries overrepresented in global usage relative to their working age population. (3) Local economic considerations shape patterns of use both in terms of topic and in mode of collaboration with Claude. (4) API customers use Claude to automate tasks with greater specialization among use cases most amenable to programmatic access. To enable researchers and policymakers to further study the impact of AI on the economy, we additionally open-source the underlying data for this report.

Motivation: 研究英国七个世纪的宏观经济波动情况，了解商业周期动态的演变。

Method: 使用带随机波动率的时变VAR模型，将解释未来产出方差最大份额的创新确定为商业周期冲击。

Result: 1900年前冲击呈滞胀性、供给驱动模式，1900年后变为需求驱动；产出波动率随时间下降，17世纪达到峰值；16 - 17世纪货币化有较大实际影响，之后转向更多通胀影响。

Conclusion: 商业周期动态随制度、货币和结构变革而演变。

Abstract: We study macroeconomic fluctuations in the United Kingdom over seven centuries (1271--2022) using a time-varying VAR with stochastic volatility. We identify business cycle shocks as innovations explaining the largest share of future output variance. Before 1900, these shocks display a stagflationary, supply-driven pattern, while post-1900 shocks become demand-driven, raising both output and inflation. Output volatility declines over time, peaking in the seventeenth century. Monetisation had large real effects in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, shifting to more inflationary impacts thereafter. Our results highlight how business cycle dynamics evolve with institutional, monetary, and structural transformations.

Conclusion: 解释长周期或动荡时期事件研究结果需谨慎，有条件时应重视准实验设计。

Abstract: Financial event studies, ubiquitous in finance research, typically use linear factor models with known factors to estimate abnormal returns and identify causal effects of information events. This paper demonstrates that when factor models are misspecified -- an almost certain reality -- traditional event study estimators produce inconsistent estimates of treatment effects. The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures. Revisiting four empirical applications, we show that some established findings may reflect model misspecification rather than true treatment effects. While traditional methods remain reliable for short-horizon studies with random event timing, our results suggest caution when interpreting long-horizon or volatile-period event studies and highlight the importance of quasi-experimental designs when available.

Abstract: Accurately simulating wave propagation is crucial in fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and seismic analysis. Traditional numerical methods, like finite difference and finite element approaches, are widely used to solve governing partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Helmholtz equation. However, these methods face significant computational challenges when applied to high-frequency wave problems in complex two-dimensional domains. This work investigates Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs) and their multilevel extensions as a promising alternative. These methods leverage domain decomposition, partitioning the computational domain into overlapping sub-domains, each governed by a local neural network. We assess their accuracy and computational efficiency in solving the Helmholtz equation for the homogeneous case, demonstrating their potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: In multi-objective optimization, multiple loss terms are weighted and added together to form a single objective. These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm. Code Availability: https://github.com/maxhirsch/Efficient-NTK

Conclusion: 所提技术有效，可推广和机械化树查询优化，提高查询性能。

Abstract: Trees can accelerate queries that search or aggregate values over large collections. They achieve this by storing metadata that enables quick pruning (or inclusion) of subtrees when predicates on that metadata can prove that none (or all) of the data in a subtree affect the query result. Existing systems implement this pruning logic manually for each query predicate and data structure. We generalize and mechanize this class of optimization. Our method derives conditions for when subtrees can be pruned (or included wholesale), expressed in terms of the metadata available at each node. We efficiently generate these conditions using symbolic interval analysis, extended with new rules to handle geometric predicates (e.g., intersection, containment). Additionally, our compiler fuses compound queries (e.g., reductions on filters) into a single tree traversal. These techniques enable the automatic derivation of generalized single-index and dual-index tree joins that support a wide class of join predicates beyond standard equality and range predicates. The generated traversals match the behavior of expert-written code that implements query-specific traversals, and can asymptotically outperform the linear scans and nested-loop joins that existing systems fall back to when hand-written cases do not apply.

Abstract: Discrete structures are currently second-class in differentiable programming. Since functions over discrete structures lack overt derivatives, differentiable programs do not differentiate through them and limit where they can be used. For example, when programming a neural network, conditionals and iteration cannot be used everywhere; they can break the derivatives necessary for gradient-based learning to work. This limits the class of differentiable algorithms we can directly express, imposing restraints on how we build neural networks and differentiable programs more generally. However, these restraints are not fundamental. Recent work shows conditionals can be first-class, by compiling them into differentiable form as linear neurons. Similarly, this work shows iteration can be first-class -- by compiling to linear recurrent neurons. We present a minimal typed, higher-order and linear programming language with iteration called $\textsf{Cajal}\scriptstyle(\mathbb{\multimap}, \mathbb{2}, \mathbb{N})$. We prove its programs compile correctly to recurrent neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation, we conduct two experiments where we link these recurrent neurons against a neural network solving an iterative image transformation task. This determines part of its function prior to learning. As a result, the network learns faster and with greater data-efficiency relative to a neural network programmed without first-class iteration. A key lesson is that recurrent neurons enable a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.
