This work aims to increase the representativeness of the\nvolume element by attenuating the mesh and size sensitivities in representative\nvolume element (RVE) modelling. A technique to alleviate mesh sensitivity in\nRVE modelling is proposed, which equalises the fracture energy observed from\ncomputational analysis with the real phenomenon, thereby keeping the response\nindependent of the bandwidth of strain localisation. Based on the hypothesis\nthat ensuring periodicity of strain, in addition to displacement periodicity\nacross the domain boundary and supplementing the capability of periodic\nboundary conditions (PBCs) to attenuate the size dependency in RVE modelling, a\nset of modified PBCs (MPBCs) are formulated. One thousand two hundred RVE\nsamples falling into combinations of five fibre volume fractions and four RVE\nsizes are analysed under transverse loading, and the ability of MPBCs to\nattenuate the effect of RVE size on the precision of material response,\nparticularly in the inelastic regime, is verified. This work also focuses on\nvarious factors affecting damage initiation in 2D composite RVEs.

Our empirical\nstrategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning,\nwhich we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from Amazon.com products.\nOur first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms\ncan facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers,\nand even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases\nthe algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive\nprices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower\nadvertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our\nsecond contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency\nkeyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on Amazon.com. Our\nestimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different\nproduct keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative\ninteraction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage\nindex, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we\nanalyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price\nadjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission\nadjustments will.

Previous\ntheoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal\nsequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all\ncontinuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings\nof tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures\nfor LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as\nfunctions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have\nfocused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this\npaper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM\narchitectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,\nthese new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM\ncategories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential\nobjects, and subobject classifiers.

However, the domain of game-playing poses\na particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large\nstate space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of\nthe policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal\npatterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this\nmatrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the\nhighest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE\nwith CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input\nstate, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using\nthis internal logic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u62d3\u6251\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08TCMs\uff09\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u5176\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8303\u7574\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u7b49\u4ef7\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c55\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4f17\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\uff08co\uff09\u5b8c\u5907\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u6210\u7684TCMs\uff0c\u7528\uff08co\uff09\u6781\u9650\u6c42\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u6362\u8861\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7528\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u7b49\u4ef7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7528Mitchell - Benabou\u8bed\u8a00\u548cKripke - Joyal\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eTCMs\u8303\u7574\u662f\uff08co\uff09\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6709\uff08co\uff09\u6781\u9650\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u201c\u89e3\u201d\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u7531\u5b50\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u6307\u6570\u5bf9\u8c61\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u5bf9TCMs\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u8303\u7574\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u7b49\u4ef7\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u903b\u8f91\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However,\ncommercial models like ChatGPT require significant computing power, which leads\nto high energy use and carbon emissions. This has raised concerns about their\nenvironmental impact. In this study, we evaluate open-source Small Language\nModels (SLMs) trained explicitly for code generation and compare their\nperformance and energy efficiency against large LLMs and efficient\nhuman-written Python code. The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match\nthe performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while\nproducing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from\nLeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and\nhard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,\nStarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial\nmodels, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner.

However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified\npredictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary\ndependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,\nand propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns\nfor prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive\nanalysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model\nbehaviors and practical guidelines for future applications.

Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our\nderandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing\ncongestion and maintaining a low round complexity.\n  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can\ntarget precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain\ncodeword.

Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node\nitself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes.

These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the\ndesign of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose\nHat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated\nlearning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated\nas a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the\ngoal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy\nconsumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a\ntwo-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication\ntopologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance\nand energy cost.

To tackle this, we\nintroduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote\nsensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in\nriver networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality\nseries and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally\nadaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components.

Log\nlevel choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it\ncontrols log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and\nperformance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged\nlarge language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that\ndemonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8).\nNevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context\nexamples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within\nmodern software projects.

By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from\nthese semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent\nprompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy.\nOur results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings\nstatistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\\% AUC) of the\nevaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging\nrandomly selected in-context examples from the whole project).

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines\npromise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal\nonly for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for\ndata layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead\nand underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we\npresent XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables\nlayout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three\nkey innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing\nsoftware address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA\narchitecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from\ndata transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data\nmanipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to 151.2x/8.2x higher\nlink utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and\nachieves 2.3x average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world\napplications. Our design incurs <2% area overhead over SoTA DMA solutions while\nconsuming 17% of system power.

Traditional user profiling often fails to\ncapture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as\ntransient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper\npresents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating\nsemantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel\nend-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a\nsystematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the\ndynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.\nThis approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for\nrecommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into\ncomprehensive user embeddings.

Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent\nrewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To\naddress these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting\nframework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It\nintegrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting.

It updates network weights through gradient\ndescent to minimize a loss function representing the mismatch between\npredictions and desired outputs. BP uses the chain rule to propagate the loss\ngradient backward through the network hierarchy, allowing efficient weight\nupdates. However, this process requires weight updates at every layer to rely\non a global error signal generated at the network's output.\n  In contrast, the Hebbian model of synaptic plasticity states that weight\nupdates are local, depending only on the activity of pre- and post-synaptic\nneurons. This suggests biological brains likely do not implement BP directly.\nRecently, Predictive Coding (PC) has gained interest as a biologically\nplausible alternative that updates weights using only local information.\nOriginating from 1950s work on signal compression, PC was later proposed as a\nmodel of the visual cortex and formalized under the free energy principle,\nlinking it to Bayesian inference and dynamical systems. PC weight updates rely\nsolely on local information and provide theoretical advantages such as\nautomatic scaling of gradients based on uncertainty.\n  This lecture notes column offers a novel, tutorial-style introduction to PC,\nfocusing on its formulation, derivation, and connections to well-known\noptimization and signal processing algorithms such as BP and the Kalman Filter\n(KF). It aims to support existing literature by guiding readers from the\nmathematical foundations of PC to practical implementation, including Python\nexamples using PyTorch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff08BP\uff09\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5f15\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\uff08PC\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6559\u7a0b\u98ce\u683c\u4ecb\u7ecdPC\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ca\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u542bPython\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "BP\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0BP\uff0cPC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ec5\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u65b0\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u751f\u7269\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecdPC\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u6559\u7a0b\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4ecePC\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bfb\u8005\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed9\u51faPython\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86PC\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eBP\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bfb\u8005\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3PC\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive\nRetrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the\nframework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to\nconstruct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery.

However, existing FL\nframeworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and\nthe growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers\nfrom high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with\nlarge models.

In this approach, each clause - a\nlogical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is\ndisqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict.

As a result, each clause\neffectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,\nenabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed\nfuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory\nfootprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy.

Our approach not only enhances the solution quality\nfor standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale\ninstances with up to 30,000 customer nodes.

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware\nSpatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph\nconvolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network\nto effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and\n(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both\nexpected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York\nCity, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty\nquantification.

Prior work\ntypically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards\nbetter solutions.

Recently,\ntest-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving\nsolution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to\neach task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this\nproblem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a\nsearch algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training\ndata.

HI aims to reduce\nlatency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the\nLocal-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the\nlocal inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating\nthe likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data\ndistributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term\nHierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by\nmodeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing\nfunction of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical\nobservations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and\nHI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We\ndemonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\\log T)$, a\nsignificant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret\nguarantees.

In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named\nGF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS\nbenchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model\nQwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading\nsymbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are\nnoticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive\nanalysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,\ntraining epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578bGF - Reasoner\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u51b3\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u7eaf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u9519\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u5728\u65b0\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5 - VL - 7B\u7684GF - Reasoner\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe15%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u77ed\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Among these physiological signals,\nheart rate (HR) plays a central role, as it is widely used in monitoring and\nmanaging cardiovascular conditions and detecting extreme physiological events\nsuch as hypoglycemia. However, data from wearable devices often suffer from\nmissing values. To address this issue, recent studies have employed various\nimputation techniques. Traditionally, the effectiveness of these methods has\nbeen evaluated using predictive accuracy metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE,\nwhich assess numerical proximity to the original data. While informative, these\nmetrics fail to capture the complex statistical structure inherent in\nphysiological signals. This study bridges this gap by presenting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of four statistical imputation methods, linear\ninterpolation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating\nPolynomial (PCHIP), and B splines, for short term HR data gaps. We assess their\nperformance using both predictive accuracy metrics and statistical distance\nmeasures, including the Cohen Distance Test (CDT) and Jensen Shannon Distance\n(JS Distance), applied to HR data from the D1NAMO dataset and the BIG IDEAs Lab\nGlycemic Variability and Wearable Device dataset.

Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks.

The\nhybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to\nsolve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as\ncombinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of\nnext-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further\nimproved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes\nsuch that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the\nformer. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration\nperformance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low\ncomputational cost even for a large-scale problem.

Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity\nchallenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart\ngrids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic\nobject-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and\nintroduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the\nlimitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting\nthreats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging\ngenerative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include\nthe suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to\ngenerate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring\nprotocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to\naddress data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs\nincorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for\nimproved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based\nADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the\noutperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated\nGOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eIEC61850\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5f00\u53d1\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u51faAATM\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8eGenAI\u7684ADS\u53ca\u4e0eML - based ADS\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eIEC61850\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u53d8\u7535\u7ad9\u5b58\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAATM\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210GOOSE\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eGenAI\u7684ADS\uff1b\u5c06GenAI - based ADS\u4e0eML - based ADS\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ec5\u8868\u793a\u8981\u5c55\u793aGenAI - based ADS\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u4e2d\u672a\u660e\u786e\u5f97\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u671fGenAI - based ADS\u5728\u8003\u8651AATM\u751f\u6210\u7684GOOSE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

In this paper, we benchmark\nthese algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including\none- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and\nnext-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total\n$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling\ninterpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal\nstates of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular\nand material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems\nas thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian\nconstructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges\nconstructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned\nalgorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including\nthose constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect\none-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.\nFinally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as\nalternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed\ntemperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these\nencoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical\nqubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u5076\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7535\u8377\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5df2\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u7ecf\u5178\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50 - \u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50 - \u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u63a7\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u70ed\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In-memory computing\narchitectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both\ndigital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from\nvarious limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy\nefficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing\narchitecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic\ncomputing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency,\nscalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory\nread operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a\nnegligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output\nmultiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality.\nExtensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the\naccuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4\nto 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average\nrelative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared\nto 64-bit double precision floating-point format.

However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such\ncomplex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under\nand following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively\ncaptured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and\ncalibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for\nPredicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict\nboth the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block\nlevel under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.\nGuided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory\nguides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation\ndynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention\nmodule for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a\nregularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs\nsignificantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial\nland use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%\nimprovement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided\nmodules was further validated through ablation studies.

To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped\npotential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective\ntools to harness them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63ed\u793a\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u632f\u8361\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u4f46\u88ab\u540e\u7eed\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u7968\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\uff08\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5982\u5728Countdown\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528\u8d1fTSE\u5956\u52b1\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534724.7%\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u7edd\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e24\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
