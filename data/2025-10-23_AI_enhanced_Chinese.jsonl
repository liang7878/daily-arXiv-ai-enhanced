Fields such as healthcare, biomedical\nresearch, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,\nlimited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.\nThese issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the\ndevelopment of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such\nhigh-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive\nlarge language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset\ngeneration in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,\nsemantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to\nspecialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)\nsyntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic\nelement injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.\nTogether, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,\ndomain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively\nalleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and\naccurate machine learning model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecdFlexiDataGen\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\uff09\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6311\u6218\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FlexiDataGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u53e5\u6cd5 - \u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u91ca\u4e49\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "FlexiDataGen\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexiDataGen\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We utilize this framework to parameterize the\none-dimensional advection-dispersion equation model, incorporating immobile\nphase exchange through a memory function. We solve the governing equation\nanalytically in the Laplace domain and numerically invert it to generate\nsynthetic breakthrough curves for different memory functions and boundary\nconditions. A dimensionless formulation enables decoupling the estimation of\nadvection velocity from other parameters, significantly reducing the number of\nrequired forward solutions. To improve computational efficiency, we apply a\nKarhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion to transform the synthetic dataset into a\nreduced-order space. Given a measured breakthrough curve, we estimate the\nadvection velocity by minimizing the distance from the measurement to the\nsynthetic data in KL space, and infer the remaining dimensionless parameters by\nProjected Barycentric Interpolation (PBI). We benchmark our method against\nseveral alternatives, including Laplace domain fitting, moment matching, global\nrandom optimization, and variations of the DSTE framework using\nnearest-neighbor interpolation and neural network-based estimation.

When\nprocessing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71\nseconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of\n9.62 seconds.

As part of\nthis, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing\nscalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and\ninstant feedback.

Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard\nUnit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality\nand impact on student performance.\n  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most\nhelpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.\nThese findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize\nautomated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming\neducation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u5404\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08APAS\uff09\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53cd\u9988\u53d7\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0cAI \u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76 APAS \u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u53d7\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e24\u6240\u5927\u5b66\u8d85 200 \u540d\u5b66\u751f\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53cd\u9988\u6700\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0cAI \u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6210\u7ee9\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c AI \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1\nsecond) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia,\nEurope. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging\nmethods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and\nhybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR\ncalculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5\nminute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant\neffect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong\nangular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT).

Many practical\nchallenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including\nthe considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial\ncomputational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of\nstatistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while\nenforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the\ngeneration of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack\nextremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a\nrigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.\nAdditionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable\nproperties of the $\\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and\nreal-world precipitation downscaling problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Abstract modified for arXiv", "summary": "The main goal in distributed symmetry-breaking is to understand the locality\nof problems; i.e., the radius of the neighborhood that a node needs to explore\nin order to arrive at its part of a global solution. In this work, we study the\nlocality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of\nthe main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of\nsymmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.\nFor approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the\nlocality depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph\nparameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\\Delta$ is not very small\n(namely, as long as $\\Delta \\geq \\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$), this dependence is\nonly logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal\nmatching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of\nnodes $n$ or the degree $\\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both\nresults. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a\nstrong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case\ncomplexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is\nonly $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel\nmartingale-based analysis for the $\\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby.

We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities.

RL workflows involve\ninterleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource\nrequirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales\nefficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training\nrequires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL\nframeworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated\narchitectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing\nboth stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without\nmodifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource\nunder-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances\non public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant\ncost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently\nharvested for rollout.\n  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient\nRL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that\nrollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with\npreemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these\nresources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost\nadopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout\noffload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,\n(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available\ninstances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient\npreemption handling and continuous load balancing.

However, this often leads\nto overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address\nthis issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT\n(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking\nmode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during\nthe iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational\nburden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging\nvariant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ\nin decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping\npoint for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this\ndecision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake\nthoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as\nzero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe\nthat prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification\ncapabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,\napproaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across\nmost scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate\nthat existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are\ninsufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with\nlimited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

The suffix array\n$SA_T[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ encodes the lexicographic order of its\nsuffixes and underlies numerous applications in pattern matching, data\ncompression, and bioinformatics. Previous work established one-way reductions\nshowing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank\nqueries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. More recently, a new class of prefix\nqueries was introduced, together with reductions that, among others, transform\na simple tradeoff for prefix-select queries into a suffix array tradeoff\nmatching state-of-the-art space and query-time bounds, while achieving\nsublinear construction time. For binary texts, the resulting data structure\nachieves space $O(n)$ bits, preprocessing time $O(n / \\sqrt{\\log n})$,\npreprocessing space of $O(n)$ bits, and query time $O(\\log^{\\epsilon} n)$ for\nany constant $\\epsilon > 0$. However, whether these bounds could be improved\nusing different techniques has remained open.\n  We resolve this question by presenting the first bidirectional reduction\nshowing that suffix array queries are, up to an additive $O(\\log\\log n)$ term\nin query time, equivalent to prefix-select queries in all parameters. This\nresult unifies prior approaches and shows that essentially all efficient suffix\narray representations can be expressed via prefix-select structures. Moreover,\nwe prove analogous equivalences for inverse suffix array queries, pattern\nranking, lexicographic range, and SA-interval queries, identifying six core\nproblem pairs that connect string and prefix query models. Our framework thus\nprovides a unified foundation for analyzing and improving the efficiency of\nfundamental string-processing problems through the lens of prefix queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u6761\u76ee\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbf\u95ee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u5f52\u7ea6\u8bc1\u660e\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u80fd\u5426\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u53cc\u5411\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u540e\u7f00\u6570\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u524d\u7f00\u9009\u62e9\u67e5\u8be2\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u516d\u7ec4\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u8fde\u63a5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u548c\u524d\u7f00\u67e5\u8be2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u7f00\u67e5\u8be2\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u672c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing\nsource code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate\ndevelopment artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.\nThird-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these\nrepositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code\ncontains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing\ntools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability\nto handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract\nto be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.\nThis paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart\ncontract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs\nLLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,\ntransfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into\na fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the\nabstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow\ngraph (CFG) of each function as node information.

Nearly all\nfundamental queries can currently be efficiently supported in\n$O(\\delta(T)\\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, where $\\delta(T)$ is the substring\ncomplexity, a strong compressibility measure that lower-bounds the optimal\nspace to represent the text [Kociumaka, Navarro, Prezza, IEEE Trans.

However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore\nbuild a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability.

Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends.

For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

The former,\nsuch as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream\ntasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption.

For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses\nthe ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA\nformulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future\ndirections in RCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9135\u7bc7\u4e91\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08RCA\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bbaRCA\u7ec8\u6781\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524dRCA\u8c03\u67e5\u5ffd\u7565\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u6309\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4f1a\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u5178\u578b\u53d7\u4f17\u9700\u8981\u6309\u76ee\u6807\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684RCA\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u5bf92014 - 2025\u5e74135\u7bc7RCA\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9135\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86RCA\u7684\u7ec8\u6781\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6309\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9RCA\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51faRCA\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was\nalso empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on\nclassification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we\nshow that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient\nlearning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We\nshow that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies\nmaximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural\nactivities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an\nunderlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual\ninformation implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)\nbuilding a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is\nbased on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural\nactivity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural\nFisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the\nsensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an\nexpansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the\nproperties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors\ngive the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We\nfind that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,\nthe class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we\nnumerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices\nmatch, and essentially align with the category boundaries.

To this end, the Maximal Update\nParameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the\nupdate dynamics of internal representations stable across different model\nwidths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,\nparticularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its\nweights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we\nshow that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the\npractical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM\ntraining.

Therefore, in practice, it is\ndifficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and\neven harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which\nleverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent\nconfounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with\nedge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In\naddition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions.

Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained\nmodel's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available\ndownstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and\nenhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the\nfeature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank\nFeature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space\nadaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of\ndownstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that\nunobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on\nobserved features.

A formal proof on the logical limits of symbol\n  grounding", "summary": "This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified\ntheory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate\nthrough a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise\nfrom a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove\nthat any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot\ninternally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to\nself-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with\nany finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently\nincomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very \"act\" of connecting an internal\nsymbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within\nthe system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that\nany attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external \"judgment\"\nalgorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic\nsystem.

Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that\nenergy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize\nthat, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to\nidentical feature vectors as diffusion progresses.

We\npropose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER\nto multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL\npolicy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method\nfirst extracts compact feature representations from image observations,\nperforms SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to\ngenerate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as\ndecision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to\ninterpret RL policy's decision structure.

Existing approaches typically\nrely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection.

Extensive experiments\nacross vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently\nimproves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training\ndata, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.\nOur findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently\ntransferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer\nexpertise for building a stronger SSM community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCAB\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230SSM\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u5347SSM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SSM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u751f\u6001\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u4e0eTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross - architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6865\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347SSM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u5229\u7528Transformer\u4e13\u957f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684SSM\u793e\u533a\u3002"}}

Both architectures are trained on\npaired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter\ncorpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across\nall benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a\n31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading\nWhisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%\ndecrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the\nfeasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering\nnew opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and\naccessibility-oriented AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdStutterZero\u548cStutterFormer\u4e24\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6ce2\u5f62\u5230\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u5df4\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6d41\u7545\u8bed\u97f3\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8f6c\u6362\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u8d857000\u4e07\u4eba\u7ed3\u5df4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u5df4\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5df4\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStutterZero\u548cStutterFormer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5377\u79ef - \u53cc\u5411LSTM\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u53cc\u6d41Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728FluencyBank\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "StutterZero\u6bd4Whisper - Medium\u6a21\u578bWER\u964d\u4f4e24%\uff0cBERTScore\u63d0\u9ad831%\uff1bStutterFormer\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0cWER\u964d\u4f4e28%\uff0cBERTScore\u63d0\u9ad834%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u5df4\u5230\u6d41\u7545\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\u3002"}}

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets.

Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules\nin LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied\nindependently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio\nconstraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules\nbecomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms\nand mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.\nHowever, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic\nalgorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while\nmask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between\nsingular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current\nmethods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a\ncompression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal\nlocal minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation\n(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that\nenables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable\nparameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter\nselection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is\noften suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling\nor disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness\ncorrection. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness\ncorrection mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and\nthereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new\ncontrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed\nto minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive\ngroups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups.

PoSh is replicable,\ninterpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics\n(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new\ndataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with\nexpert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with\ngranular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,\nDOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed\nimage description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh\nachieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\\rho$) with the human judgments\nin DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type\n(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward\nfunction, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we\ncharacterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the\npaintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models\nstruggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene\ndynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress.

In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the\nIntegrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and\nenergy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate\n(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively\napplies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and\nre-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed\nstorage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization\nscale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs\nenergy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while\navoiding explicit dequantization.

Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning\n(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed\nby operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm\npresents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision\nmisalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy\nwithout considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved\npredictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the\nbias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,\nselection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized\ncontrolled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --\nresulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused\nCausal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.\nFirst, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using\nexperimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss\nfunctions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a\nbi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and\nexperimental data, solved via implicit differentiation.

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on\nseveral widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream\nMLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the\neffectiveness and superiority of our method.

Existing meta-learners for the\ntime-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus\nsuffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address\nthis problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)\nmeta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with\nhigh probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This\noffers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract\ninstabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE\nestimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population\nrisk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our\nWO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it\nis robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions.

This paper systematically argues that the\nfield of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning\nand modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference,\nDensity Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation\nLearning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and\nUnification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical\nprinciples. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and\nestimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of\nclustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent\nnetworks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an\nunbroken statistical lineage.

Recognizing\nthis statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary\nstep for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent\nsystems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to\nre-embrace this statistical foundation.

Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action\ntraces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance\nreasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on\ntext-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in\nshaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage\nscreenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By\ngrounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim\nto narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby\nenabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.\nSpecifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale\ngeneration, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises\naction history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot.

In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy\nLearning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'\nbehavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model\ninfers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a\ntrait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The\nmechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting\nwith the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online\nduring real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.\nExperiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and\nfacility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based\nand model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSWM - AP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SWM - AP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6536\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u65ad\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a0e\u6536\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\u9009\u5740\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSWM - AP\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SWM - AP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\\% compared to\nstate-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed\nclassification accuracy up to 8\\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate\nenhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth\nbiases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling\ndepth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,\noffering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data.

By foregrounding this\nthree-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just\nautomation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt\ncrafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured\nreflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with\nnotes of teachers and researchers.

However, the\nobjective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning\nobjective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good\nplanning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future\nframes as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic\ninformation about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

Existing computational and\nexperimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate\nchemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled\ndatasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse\napplication domains.

Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures\nnuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse\nrange of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400\nstructure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art\nperformance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and\nquantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve\nreal-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte\nsolvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction,\nstereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and\nmulti-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using\nmechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends\nnot explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn\ngeneralizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized\nBayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of\nmodel development by an order of magnitude.

The software (model) is now only minimally altered\nby tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation\nvalues when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those\nunique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant\nbit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly\nmanipulate the final output logits for misclassification.\n  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no\ncomplete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears\nfully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible\nclean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art\nmodel-level defenses without any adaptive optimization.

(3) The overall\nrecognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.\nThese findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition\nability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the\nneed for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical\npractice.

Two widely studied approaches are\ndirective feedback, which gives explicit explanations and reduces cognitive\nload to speed up learning, and metacognitive feedback which prompts learners to\nreflect, track their progress, and develop self-regulated learning (SRL)\nskills. While both approaches have clear theoretical advantages, their\ncomparative effects on engagement, confidence, and quality of work remain\nunderexplored. This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial\nwith 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an\nadaptive educational platform. Participants were assigned to receive directive,\nmetacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback that blended elements of both\ndirective and metacognitive feedback. Results showed that revision behaviour\ndiffered across feedback conditions, with Hybrid prompting the most revisions\ncompared to Directive and Metacognitive.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines.

We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bHubble\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u53d8\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u63d2\u5165\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u7531\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5927\u5c0f\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u6301\u7eed\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u91ca\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba9\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u524d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0cHubble\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
