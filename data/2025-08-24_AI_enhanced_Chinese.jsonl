We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents.

Even for options close\nto expiry and far-OTM, the pricing takes a few tens or hundreds of ms. We show\nthat, for the calibrated parameters in El Euch and Rosenbaum (Math.Finance\n2019, v.29), the model implied vol surface is much flatter and fits the market\ndata poorly; thus the calibration in op.cit. is a case of ``ghost calibration''\n(M.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorski\\u{i}, Quant.

We explain how such\nerrors arise in popular iFT implementations that use fixed numerical\nparameters, yielding spurious smiles/skews, and provide numerical evidence that\nSINH acceleration is faster and more accurate than competing methods. Robust\nerror control is ensured by a general Conformal Bootstrap principle that we\nformulate; the principle is applicable to many Fourier-pricing methods.

In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness\nare known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,\nthe stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to\nimproving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby\nrelaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to\nrelaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that\nstudents may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without\nsuch envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who\nare not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are\nacquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,\nrepresented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy\ntoward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property\nthat there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local\nenvy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved\nwhile maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph\nstructure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that\ncan achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the\nrelaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which\nparameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers.

As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the\nquery interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both\nthe number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the\ninterval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.\nExperimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up\nto four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art\nOTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core\nanalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u65f6\u6001k - \u6838\u67e5\u8be2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5CoreT\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4OTCD\u5feb\u8fbe\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5OTCD\u5728\u65f6\u6001k - \u6838\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u56e0\u533a\u95f4\u679a\u4e3e\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u957f\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5CoreT\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u8fdb\u5165k - \u6838\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u4ee5\u5927\u91cf\u524a\u51cf\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "CoreT\u53ea\u9700\u5355\u904d\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u65f6\u6001\u8fb9\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u533a\u95f4\u65f6\u957f\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6bd4OTCD\u5feb\u8fbe\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "CoreT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u6001k - \u6838\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Although no\ncommercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven\nstates have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This\nstudy evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned\nprojects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore\nRenewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional\ninput-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial\nEcology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation,\nwhich are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects.\nEnvironmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional\ngreenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions\nof offshore wind construction.

The conclusions of the study are that although the\nstrategies (portfolios) performance differed significantly between different\ncombinations of parameters, generally the best results in terms of the\ninformation ratio and annualized returns are obtained using the LSTM-RNN\nmodels. Moreover, longer observation windows translate into better performance\nof the deep learning models indicating that these methods require longer\nwindows to be able to efficiently capture the long-term dependencies of the\nvariance-covariance matrix structure.

However,\npractitioners often operate under a \"utility-first\" paradigm, prioritizing a\ndesired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.\n  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this \"utility-first\" perspective\nby introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace\nnoise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly\naccurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy\ncost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace\nmechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.\nHowever, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are\nprimarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.\n  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we\nextend the work of Wu et al.

However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces\npractical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference\nlatency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and\nacceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge\nfrom large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient\ninference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this\ntechnique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains\nlargely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of\nKD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD\nmethods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across\neight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three\ndownstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers\nnotable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared\nwith standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better\neffectiveness as the teacher model.

However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety\nalignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent\nplanning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access\nto both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently\nunavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe\nSpectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and\nmodel-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models\nby inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce\nMagnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes\nthe structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude\ninformation. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a\nsharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and\npotentially unsafe updates.

Traditional\napproaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully\nranked lists of items.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework\nthat learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our\napproach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,\ntask-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be\nexplicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given\napplication. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active\nsampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that\nare expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final\nrecommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic\nPlackett-Luce framework for pairwise data.

However,\nmany current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,\nand complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for\nsynthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this\nbackground, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can\nreliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the\nuse of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method\nfor synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we\nreplicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and\ncompared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood\npressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and\ndiabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO\nGesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family\nHealth Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and\nvariable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables\nrelevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all\nreplicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications\nconsistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively\nlow sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely\nmatched the original results across various descriptive and inferential\nanalyses.

GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations\nby 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query\nlatency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faI/O\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565GoVector\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u76d8\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u91cd\u6392\u78c1\u76d8\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u57fa\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u7d22\u5f15I/O\u6210\u4e3b\u5bfc\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGoVector\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u91cd\u6392\u78c1\u76d8\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11I/O\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c90%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1146% I/O\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.73\u500d\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e42%\u3002", "conclusion": "GoVector\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u78c1\u76d8\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the\nCRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into\ntransferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability\nvia multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level\ntransfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and\nStandalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully\ndeployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of\nbillions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters\nwith billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand\nfeatures. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+\nsuccessful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including\nprimary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an\noverall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated\nannual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u7684LFM4Ads\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u7efc\u5408\u8f6c\u79fb\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u817e\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GMV\u548c\u6536\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7528\u6237\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u7528\u6237 - \u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u53c9\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6237\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u5ffd\u7565\u66f4\u591a\u8f6c\u79fb\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLFM4Ads\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8f6c\u79fb\u7528\u6237\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4ea4\u53c9\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u63d0\u53d6\u5c42\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u540c\u6784\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u817e\u8baf\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u81ea2024\u5e74Q4\u4e0a\u7ebf\u540e\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b010\u591a\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u6574\u4f53GMV\u63d0\u53472.45%\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u5e74\u6536\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002", "conclusion": "LFM4Ads\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u3002"}}

Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to\nconduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to\napply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of\nGA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,\nexisting studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when\nsimultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal\nrecommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework\ntailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with\na GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,\nCAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining\nterms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is\nsolved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective\nunlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning\non batches of unlearning samples.

The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code\nwith no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and\ncoverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants\nof seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It\nuses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog\ndesigns, making the generated variants have complex control flows and\nstructures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,\ncompares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.\nExperiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to\nvendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5FPGA\u903b\u8f91\u7efc\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5VERMEI\uff0c\u542b\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "FPGA\u903b\u8f91\u7efc\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "VERMEI\u5305\u542b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u50f5\u5c38\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u627e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Yosys\u3001Vivado\u548cQuartus\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cVERMEI\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u5411\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u62a5\u544a15\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c9\u4e2a\u88ab\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "VERMEI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5FPGA\u903b\u8f91\u7efc\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each\nTD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used\naction research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates\nIT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed\nquestionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)\nadopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making\nsituations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.\nPractitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's\nevolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging\nfruits.

We showed that a\nworkshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.\nNew ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a\nre-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations\nfor TD prioritization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u6982\u5ff5\u5728IT\u516c\u53f8\u5efa\u7acbTDM\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eTD\u610f\u8bc6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "TDM\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u5c11\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acbTDM\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5bf9TD\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406IT\u56e2\u961f\u8fdb\u884c16\u4e2a\u6708\u4e94\u4e2a\u884c\u52a8\u5468\u671f\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u5377\u3001\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f1a\u8bae\u3001\u91c7\u7528TD - SAGAT\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u79ef\u538b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8003\u5bdfTD\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u503e\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684TD\u507f\u8fd8\u4e0e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u79ef\u538b\u9879\u63d0\u9192\u4f7fTD\u610f\u8bc6\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6d41\u7a0b\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6IT\u56e2\u961f\u7684TDM\u65b0\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient\ninformation interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially\naddress this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture\nuser intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into\ngenerative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.\nHowever, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic\nrepresentations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning\npathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that\nconstructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a\nself-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.\nSpecifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook\n(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby\nconstructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance\nthe reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement\nstage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a\nMulti-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions\ntailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA\nintroduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization.

GPS\ncan find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs\nthat trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that\nrenders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,\ninput-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense\nthat it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we\nintroduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve\nrefutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance.

However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of\nhyperparameters, especially the step-size.

Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024].

Inaccuracies in either lead to poor placement\ndecisions and degraded cluster performance. In this paper, we show that in\ndensely packed workloads, such as serverless applications, CPU context\nswitching overheads can become so significant that a node's performance is\nseverely degraded, even when the orchestrator placement is theoretically sound.\nIn practice this issue is typically mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster,\nleading to wasted resources.\n  We show that these context switching overhead arise from both an increase in\nthe average cost of an individual context switch and a higher rate of context\nswitching, which together amplify overhead multiplicatively when managing large\nnumbers of concurrent cgroups, Linux's group scheduling mechanism for managing\nmulti-threaded colocated workloads. We propose and evaluate modifications to\nthe standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the\nsame effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size. The key insight\nbehind our approach is to prioritise task completion over low-level per-task\nfairness, enabling the scheduler to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly\nand thereby reduce time spent on context switching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faKubernetes\u7b49\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u56e0CPU\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u81f4\u8282\u70b9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u6539Linux\u5185\u6838\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c0f28%\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u7fa4\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u4f5c\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u653e\u7f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0bCPU\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d6a\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6Linux\u5185\u6838\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u800c\u975e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u51cf\u5c0f28%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539Linux\u5185\u6838\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5207\u6362\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of\nnoise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.\nRecent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.\nHowever, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,\nresulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the\ncomplete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and\ngenerative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest\nNetwork) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user\ninterest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest\nextraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain\ninterest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between\ninterest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user\ninterests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and\ninterest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented\ninterest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with\nthe latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted\ninterest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the\ngenerated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive\noffline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial\ndataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.\nMoreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B\ntesting.

However, current CTR\nmodels generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by\nthe scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR\npredictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the\nmodel grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this\nmodel into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into\npractice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention\nNetwork). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single\nUAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also\nmeasures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple\nperspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving\nthe way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high\nperformance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long\ninference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel\ninference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to\ntrain the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The\ndistilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the\nLightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results\nshow that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning\nthree orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled\nLightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More\nimportantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online\nservice, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average\ninference time acceptable.

However, the vast\nmajority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully\nobserved data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an\nassumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often\nmissing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In\naddition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to\ndropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such\ncoarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of\nwell-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and\nefficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of\nobtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given\ncoarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve\nour goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the\noutcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened\ndata, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our\nprincipled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating\nflexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the\nunderlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well.

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations\ninto sparse, more interpretable features.

This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,\nwe propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention\nmethod that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted\nsuppression.

In the first half of the paper, we review the\nbasic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,\nshowing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce\na standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas\nand Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and\ntheir proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms\nfor MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain\ncategory forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject\nclassifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we\nmove on to universal coalgebras.

While prior\nwork typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward\nsignals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent\ncontributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment.

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the\nrecursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by\ninfrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and\ntemporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,\nparticularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and\ndeployment concentrate value and decision-making.

This research\nproposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate\nDifferential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation\nlearning.

Self-supervised contrastive learning has\nemerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from\nunlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise\naugmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG\nrecordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning\nframework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to\nconstruct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired\nby the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages\nthe model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features\nthat persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthat poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional\ntwo-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher\nAUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to\nfour times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock\npre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we\nachieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total\ncomputation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.\nThrough extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate\nrobustness across various hyperparameters.

Extensive evaluations on five\nbenchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal\nsegmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and\ntemporal biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEvoFormer\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbf\u95ee\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u6f14\u5316\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbf\u95ee\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\u6f14\u5316\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5Transformer\u6a21\u5757\u7f13\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbf\u95ee\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u6f14\u5316\u654f\u611f\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\u514b\u670d\u7a81\u53d8\u6f14\u5316\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEvoFormer\u5728\u56fe\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6392\u540d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoFormer\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

In humans, conformity arises from informational\ninfluence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence\n(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by\nshifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear\nwhether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts\nthe information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively\ndisentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated\nnine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,\ninvestment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,\nrespectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the\nmodels' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently\nrising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is\ndramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,\nthis informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs\nsystematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty\ntriggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models\nadditionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight\npublic signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f309\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4ece\u4f17\u5fc3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea7\u8054\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u64cd\u7eb5\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5d\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u968f\u8bc1\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c4\u8303\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4ece\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u53d7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Fast progression was VFI decline\n<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were\nAI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined\nfive regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution.

To address the rarity of\ndocumented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using\ndomain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating\nranges.

Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as\na mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a\nmulti-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply\nreversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a\ndiffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty.

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used\nmachine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness\nthroughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and\naccurate.

However, the adaptive routing in MoE\narchitectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized\nexperts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack\nsurface for privacy breaches.

In this work, we present an environment in\nwhich multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,\nreflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into\nthe development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent\nsettings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat\ncommon enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals.

First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support\nmultiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of\nheterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint\nenforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,\nreducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,\nto address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier\nfeature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple\nmappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,\nwe introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the\nterminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint\nfor the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we\npropose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which\npreserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger\npenalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively\nchallenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training.

Existing\napproaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal\naxis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and\ncomputational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained\nimportance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),\nthereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model\naccuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically\nacross both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero\ninformation for a given query, while others spike in relevance.

However, it creates novel\nattack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused\non attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more\nfundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are\nembedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has\nbeen primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,\nlarge-scale evaluation.\n  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent\nrobustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is\nconstructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To\nachieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a\ncomprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering\n10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents\nsetting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,\nachieving an attack success rate of 72.8\\%.

AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and\ninterpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression\nand explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph\nbaseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and\nheterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana\nspecimens.

Training and validation were conducted using\npatient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic\nimages via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was\nimplemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,\nRelativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN\nimproved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference\n(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical\nfor stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved\nunstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),\na Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement\n(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the\ngenerator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings\nhighlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,\nparticularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need\nfor careful selection of adversarial strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u76844D Flow MRI\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u60a3\u8005\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0cWasserstein GAN\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u63d0\u53474D Flow MRI\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "4D Flow MRI\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0cGAN\u5728\u975e\u533b\u5b66\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4f46\u57284D Flow MRI\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e13\u7528GAN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Vanilla\u3001Relativistic\u548cWasserstein\u4e09\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GAN\u6bd4\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u53c2\u8003\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd1\u58c1\u901f\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\uff1bVanilla\u548cRelativistic GAN\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cWasserstein GAN\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u65f6\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u63d0\u53474D Flow MRI\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While deep learning-based\naccelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from\nundersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with\ninfinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical\ntasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as\nacceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are\neither unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical\nendpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition\nframework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a\nprobabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then\npropagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of\ninterest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use\nconformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated\nconfidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively\nsamples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence\ninterval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a\nuser-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and\ncardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach\nreduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal\nstatistical guarantees on the precision of the final image.

To tackle these challenges, we\npropose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and\nmitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional\nframework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include\ntruthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types\ncovering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation\nstrategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and\ninference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and\n28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and\nproprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation\nmethods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in\ncurrent models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general\ncapabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by\nboth multimodal training and inference.

In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is\nemployed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this\nsetup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in\nterms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the\nwireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp\ndistortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically\nshows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network\nresources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we\ndesign the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function\ndegradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The\nchallenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and\ncomputation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a\nlow-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control\nand the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less\nsensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained\nand vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed\nof one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.\nNumerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the\ntheoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well\ncoordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,\ncommunication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u611f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5931\u771f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1ISCC\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ade\u4e89\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u5404\u73af\u8282\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6ISCC\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigated three models for the\nartificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a\nU-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a\nseries of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the\nclassification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant\ncategories.

The results demonstrate that\nthe best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an\nF1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with\nthe real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional\ndiagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher\nclassification accuracy.

Our extensive evaluation\nthrough supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including\nzero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual\ngeneralization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is\npossible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length\nwindows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578bCUPE\uff0c\u80fd\u5728120\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u53d7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7eaf\u97f3\u7d20\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1CUPE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "CUPE\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ecUCLA\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u97f3\u7d20\u957f\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source\nof the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction.
