We study the complexity of calculating the Shapley value of a tuple for\nan aggregate conjunctive query, which applies an aggregation function to the\nresult of a conjunctive query (CQ) based on a value function that assigns a\nnumber to each query answer. Prior work by Livshits, Bertossi, Kimelfeld, and\nSebag (2020) established that this task is #P-hard for every nontrivial\naggregation function when the query is non-hierarchical with respect to its\nexistential variables, assuming the absence of self-joins. They further showed\nthat this condition precisely characterizes the class of intractable CQs when\nthe aggregate function is sum or count. In addition, they posed as open\nproblems the complexity of other common aggregate functions such as min, max,\ncount-distinct, average, and quantile (including median). Towards the\nresolution of these problems, we identify for each aggregate function a class\nof hierarchical CQs where the Shapley value is tractable with every value\nfunction, as long as it is local (i.e., determined by the tuples of one\nrelation). We further show that each such class is maximal: for every CQ\noutside of this class, there is a local (easy-to-compute) value function that\nmakes the Shapley value #P-hard. Interestingly, our results reveal that each\naggregate function corresponds to a different generalization of the class of\nhierarchical CQs from Boolean to non-Boolean queries. In particular, max, min,\nand count-distinct match the class of CQs that are all-hierarchical (i.e.,\nhierarchical with respect to all variables), and average and quantile match the\nnarrower class of q-hierarchical CQs introduced by Berkholz, Keppeler, and\nSchweikardt (2017) in the context of the fine-grained complexity of query\nanswering."}

The cost of solving the HJB-PDE is\nincorporated into the total computational work, and an optimized trade off\nbetween preprocessing and sampling is proposed to minimize the overall cost.\nThe SLIS approach is extended to the multilevel setting to enhance efficiency,\nyielding a multilevel IS (MLIS) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition\nunder which the MLIS method outperforms the SLIS method is established, and a\ncommon likelihood MLIS formulation is introduced that satisfies this condition\nunder appropriate regularity assumptions. The classical multilevel Monte Carlo\ncomplexity theory can be extended to accommodate settings where the\nsingle-level variance varies with the discretization level. As a special case,\nthe variance-decay behavior observed in the IS framework stems from the zero\nvariance property of the optimal control. Notably, the total work complexity of\nMLIS can be better than an order of two. Numerical experiments in the context\nof fade duration estimation demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach\nand validate these theoretical results."}

The\nkey challenge lies in modeling the carbon footprint with limited data\navailability.\n  With the disclosed Top500.org data, and using a new tool, EasyC, we were able\nto model the operational carbon of 391 HPC systems and the embodied carbon of\n283 HPC systems. We further show how this coverage can be enhanced by\nexploiting additional public information. With improved coverage, then\ninterpolation is used to produce the first carbon footprint estimates of the\nTop 500 HPC systems. They are 1,393.7 million MT CO2e operational carbon (1\nYear) and 1,881.8 million MT CO2e embodied carbon. We also project how the Top\n500's carbon footprint will increase through 2030.\n  A key enabler is the EasyC tool which models carbon footprint with only a few\ndata metrics.

Since bit addition is such a basic task in Boolean circuit\nsynthesis, a lot of research has been done on constructing efficient circuits\nfor various special cases of it. A vast majority of these results are devoted\nto optimizing the circuit depth (also known as delay).\n  In this paper, we investigate the circuit size (also known as area) over the\nfull binary basis of bit addition. Though most of the known circuits are built\nfrom Half Adders and Full Adders, we show that, in many interesting scenarios,\nthese circuits have suboptimal size. Namely, we improve an upper bound $5n-3m$\nto $4.5n-2m$, where $n$ is the number of input bits and $m$ is the number of\noutput bits. In the regimes where $m$ is small compared to $n$ (for example,\nfor computing the sum of $n$ bits or multiplying two $n$-bit integers), this\nleads to $10\\%$ improvement.\n  We complement our theoretical result by an open-source implementation of\ngenerators producing circuits for bit addition and multiplication. The\ngenerators allow one to produce the corresponding circuits in two lines of code\nand to compare them to existing designs."}

A key ingredient in our approach is the use of flexible machine\nlearning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data\ncollection. A major novelty is that our procedure enables the construction of\nvalid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable\nand non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard\nbandit algorithms are used. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets\nconstructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method\nmaintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in\nadaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case."}

Each token is represented by a vector of\ninterpretable features (e.g. part-of-speech cues, shallow roles, boundary\nflags, sentiment polarity and strength) whose values are graded degrees from\ndifferentiable membership functions (e.g. power kernels). These per-token\nvectors form a sentence-level semantic matrix fused via a gated adapter into\nthe LM. Training uses standard next-token prediction, an auxiliary loss that\nreconstructs the semantic features from hidden states, and a lightweight\nuniformizer that regularizes adjective-class distributions. On a synthetic\ntwo-clause corpus with held-out adjectives for out-of-distribution (OOD)\ncontrol, semantic fusion improves perplexity and enables precise,\nuser-controllable generation of polarity and punctuation while maintaining\nmodel simplicity.

The emergence of more advanced\nmodels known as large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek\nR1, and Qwen3. They have demonstrated the capability of performing multi-step\nreasoning. Despite the advancement in LRMs, little attention has been paid to\nsystematically analyzing the reasoning patterns these models exhibit and how\nsuch patterns influence the generated code. This paper presents a comprehensive\nstudy aimed at investigating and uncovering the reasoning behavior of LRMs\nduring code generation. We prompted several state-of-the-art LRMs of varying\nsizes with code generation tasks and applied open coding to manually annotate\nthe reasoning traces. From this analysis, we derive a taxonomy of LRM reasoning\nbehaviors, encompassing 15 reasoning actions across four phases.\n  Our empirical study based on the taxonomy reveals a series of findings.\nFirst, we identify common reasoning patterns, showing that LRMs generally\nfollow a human-like coding workflow, with more complex tasks eliciting\nadditional actions such as scaffolding, flaw detection, and style checks.\nSecond, we compare reasoning across models, finding that Qwen3 exhibits\niterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows a more linear, waterfall-like\napproach. Third, we analyze the relationship between reasoning and code\ncorrectness, showing that actions such as unit test creation and scaffold\ngeneration strongly support functional outcomes, with LRMs adapting strategies\nbased on task context. Finally, we evaluate lightweight prompting strategies\ninformed by these findings, demonstrating the potential of context- and\nreasoning-oriented prompts to improve LRM-generated code.

To systematize this design space, we\npropose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation\nas a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three\nbias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling.\nThis formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables\nflexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive\nexperiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields\nsuperior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to\nexisting strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data\nconstruction in generative recommendation."}

Timed\nautomata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and\nrobustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal\nestimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria.\nWe integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic\noptimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision\nmission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting\nthe resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission\nparameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a\ncapability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show\nreductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating\nthe capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances."}

Their success demonstrates that large-scale\npretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize\nfrom temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to\nleverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for\naccurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific\nnature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a\nlightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate\ninformation without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on\nthe limited history provided during a single model call, learning a\nnon-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.\nHowever, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the\nhistory, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full\nhistorical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage\nmethod: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2)\ntraining a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo-\nand TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation\nmodels and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\\% improvement over base\nfoundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results\nhighlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between\ngeneric foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs."}

However,\nselecting the optimal development strategy requires balancing ease of use,\ncustomization, data privacy, and scalability. This study compares two\ndevelopment approaches: low-code platforms like AnythingLLM and Botpress, with\ncustom-coded solutions using LangChain, FAISS, and FastAPI. The research uses\nPrompt engineering, Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and personalization\nto evaluate chatbot prototypes across technical performance, scalability, and\nuser experience. Findings indicate that while low-code platforms enable rapid\nprototyping, they face limitations in customization and scaling, while\ncustom-coded systems offer more control but require significant technical\nexpertise. Both approaches successfully implement key research principles such\nas adaptive feedback loops and conversational continuity. The study provides a\nframework for selecting the appropriate development strategy based on\ninstitutional goals and resources.

Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness.

Here, we develop\na machine learning approach based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to analyze\ninterference measurements of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional Bose gases, which\nrealize the sine-Gordon quantum field theory. Trained in an unsupervised\nmanner, the VAE learns a minimal latent representation that strongly correlates\nwith the equilibrium control parameter of the system. Applied to\nnon-equilibrium protocols, the latent space uncovers signatures of frozen-in\nsolitons following rapid cooling, and reveals anomalous post-quench dynamics\nnot captured by conventional correlation-based methods. These results\ndemonstrate that generative models can extract physically interpretable\nvariables directly from noisy and sparse experimental data, providing\ncomplementary probes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics in quantum\nsimulators.

In federated learning, each client trains a local model\nusing its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the\ncentral server. The server then combines the received models using federated\naggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is\ndistributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical\nmanner.

Specifically, we employ contrastive learning to align\nmultimodality features in QB-SLT, then introduce a Sigmoid Self-attention\nWeighting (SSAW) module for adaptive feature extraction from question and sign\nlanguage sequences. Additionally, we leverage available question text through\nself-supervised learning to enhance representation and translation\ncapabilities. We evaluated our approach on newly constructed CSL-Daily-QA and\nPHOENIX-2014T-QA datasets, where SSL-SSAW achieved SOTA performance. Notably,\neasily accessible question assistance can achieve or even surpass the\nperformance of gloss assistance. Furthermore, visualization results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of incorporating dialogue in improving translation quality."}

Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse\nPDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters,\nprovides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges\nof data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for\ndiverse scientific and engineering applications."}

Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters\nseldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little\nperformance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit\nrepresentation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the\ndistributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we\nintroduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns\nauxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any\nbase forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its\nsuperior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily\nfrom correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future\noutputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of\nTimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations\nand predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible\noverhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep\nlearning time-series forecasting systems.
