A classic result of Goemans and Williamson [SODA 92:307-316] states that the problem of covering a proper set-family by a min-cost edge set admits approximation ratio $2$, by a classic primal-dual algorithm. However, there are several famous algorithmic problems whose set-family ${\\cal F}$ is disjointness-compliable but not symmetric -- among them $k$-Minimum Spanning Tree ($k$-MST), Generalized Point-to-Point Connection (G-P2P), Group Steiner, Covering Steiner, multiroot versions of these problems, and others. We will show that any such problem admits approximation ratio $O(α\\log τ)$, where $τ$ is the number of inclusion-minimal sets in the family ${\\cal F}$ that models the problem and $α$ is the best known approximation ratio for the case when $τ=1$. This immediately implies several results, among them the following two. (i) The first deterministic polynomial time $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for the G-P2P problem. Here the $τ=1$ case is the $k$-MST problem. (ii) Approximation ratio $O(\\log^4 n)$ for the multiroot version of the Covering Steiner problem, where each root has its own set of groups. Here the $τ=1$ case is the Covering Steiner problem.\n  We also discuss the parameterized complexity of covering a disjointness-compliable family ${\\cal F}$, when parametrized by $τ$. We will show that if ${\\cal F}$ is proper then the problem is fixed parameter tractable and can be solved in time $O^*(3^τ)$. For the non-symmetric case we will show that the problem admits approximation ratio between $α$ and $α+1$ in time $O^*(3^τ)$, which is essentially the best possible."}

(2024) suggest that this bound is loose, with real data bounding $χ$ by around $1.13r$ to $1.33r$ when the size of the alphabet is $σ= 4$. To better understand this gap, we present two cases for the asymptotic tightness of the $χ\\leq 2r$ bound: a general construction for arbitrary $σ$ values, and a binary alphabet case, consisting of de Bruijn sequences constructed by linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) from primitive polynomials over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.

Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search.

GACE selectively invokes GPU-based measurement only in risky intervals via a Risky Gate that detects estimation uncertainty, and a GPU Measurement Engine that performs high-speed probing with explicit cost accounting for the measurement itself. This design preserves low overhead in stable regions while improving plan stability and reducing tail latency (P99) in problematic scenarios."}

Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers."}

Designed to leverage quantitative techniques for enhanced risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies in volatile environments, the architecture employs FinBERT, a transformer-based NLP model, to extract sentiment from ESG texts, followed by unsupervised clustering (UMAP/HDBSCAN) to identify 5 latent ESG regimes, validated via PCA. These regimes are mapped to economic conditions using a dense neural network and gradient boosting classifier, achieving 84.04% training and 82.0% validation accuracy. Concurrently, time-series models (SRNN, MLP, LSTM, GRU) forecast daily closing prices, with GRU attaining an R-squared of 0.801 and LSTM delivering 52.78% directional accuracy on intraday data. A strong correlation between S&P SL20 and S&P 500, observed through moving average and volatility trend plots, further bolsters forecasting precision. A rule-based fusion logic merges ESG and time-series outputs for final market signals. By addressing literature gaps that overlook emerging markets and holistic integration, this quant-driven framework combines global correlations and local sentiment analysis to offer scalable, accurate tools for quantitative finance professionals navigating complex markets like Sri Lanka."}

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. The final published version will be available via IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Multimodal recommender systems (MRSs) are critical for various online platforms, offering users more accurate personalized recommendations by incorporating multimodal information of items. Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph.

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes."}

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal."}

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them.

A coarse mesh homogenized ESL model efficiently predicts the global displacement field, from which degrees of freedom (DOFs) along stiffened panel boundaries are extracted. A global to local DOF mapping and reconstruction procedure is developed to recover detailed boundary kinematics for local analysis. The reconstructed DOFs, together with panel geometry and loading, serve as inputs to a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT), a subtype of GNN, which rapidly and accurately predicts the detailed stress and displacement fields for any panel within the hull girder. The HGT is trained using high fidelity 3D panel finite element model with reconstructed boundary conditions, enabling it to generalize across varying panel geometries, loadings, and boundary behaviors. Once trained, the framework requires only the global ESL solution in order to generate detailed local responses, making it highly suitable for optimization. Validation on three box beam case studies demonstrates that the global prediction error is governed by the coarse mesh ESL solution, while the HGT maintains high local accuracy and clearly outperforms conventional ESL based stress estimation method."}

While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data.

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."}

We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises).\n  Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison.\n  We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead.

We evaluated multiple contemporary LLMs across two non-Cochrane systematic reviews and performance was assessed at both the full-text screening and final inclusion stages using accuracy, AUC, and calibration metrics.

In the larger Review 2 (7741 abstracts, 71 final includes), most models were highly specific but struggled to recover true includes, with prompt design influencing recall. Calibration was consistently weak across single-model configurations despite high overall accuracy.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject."}

However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults."}

A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation."}

Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives."}

Cross-validation is often computationally prohibitive at scale, while fully Bayesian hyper-parameter learning can be difficult due to the cost of posterior sampling. We develop a generative perspective on hyper-parameter tuning that combines two ideas: (i) optimization-based approximations to Bayesian posteriors via randomized, weighted objectives (weighted Bayesian bootstrap), and (ii) amortization of repeated optimization across many hyper-parameter settings by learning a transport map from hyper-parameters (including random weights) to the corresponding optimizer. This yields a ``generator look-up table'' for estimators, enabling rapid evaluation over grids or continuous ranges of hyper-parameters and supporting both predictive tuning objectives and approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We connect this viewpoint to weighted $M$-estimation, envelope/auxiliary-variable representations that reduce non-quadratic losses to weighted least squares, and recent generative samplers for weighted $M$-estimators."}

Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{VSA (VSA)}, a multi-stage paradigm designed to synthesize organized frontend assets through visual-structural alignment. Our approach first employs a spatial-aware transformer to reconstruct the visual input into a hierarchical tree representation. Moving beyond basic layout extraction, we integrate an algorithmic pattern-matching layer to identify recurring UI motifs and encapsulate them into modular templates. These templates are then processed via a schema-driven synthesis engine, ensuring the Large Language Model generates type-safe, prop-drilled components suitable for production environments.

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process.

Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers."}

We find that balancing solar and wind generation with pumped hydro energy storage eliminates the need for fossil gas without incurring a cost penalty. However, many existing long-term electricity system plans are biased to rely on fossil gas due to using temporal aggregation methods that either heavily constrain storage cycling behaviour or lose track of the state-of-charge, failing to consider the potential of low-cost long-duration off-river pumped hydro, and ignoring the broad suite of near-optimal energy transition pathways. We show that a temporal aggregation method based on 'segmentation' (fitted chronology) closely resembles the full-series optimisation, captures long-duration storage behaviour (48- and 160-hour durations), and finds a near-optimal 100% renewable electricity solution. We develop a new electricity system model to rapidly evaluate millions of other near-optimal solutions, stressing the importance of modelling pumped hydro sites with a low energy volume cost (<US$50 per kilowatt-hour), long economic lifetime (~75 years), and low real discount rate akin to other natural monopolies (<=3%).

This paper introduces the Bank Risk Interlinkage with Dynamic Graph and Event Simulations (BRIDGES) framework, which analyzes systemic risk based on the level of information complexity (zero-order, first-order, and second-order). BRIDGES utilizes the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to construct a dynamic network for 551 BRICS banks based on their strategic similarity, using zero-order information such as annual balance sheet data from 2008 to 2024. It then employs first-order information, including trends in risk ratios, to detect shifts in banks' behavior. A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), as the core of BRIDGES, is deployed to learn network evolutions and detect second-order information, such as anomalous changes in the structural relationships of the bank network. To measure the impact of anomalous changes on network stability, BRIDGES performs Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations to assess the banking system's resilience to internal financial failure and external geopolitical shocks at the individual country level and across BRICS nations. Simulation results show that the failure of the largest institutions causes more systemic damage than the failure of the financially vulnerable or dynamically anomalous ones, driven by powerful panic effects. Compared to this \"too big to fail\" scenario, a geopolitical shock with correlated country-wide propagation causes more destructive systemic damage, leading to a near-total systemic collapse. It suggests that the primary threats to BRICS financial stability are second-order panic and large-scale geopolitical shocks, which traditional risk analysis models might not detect."}

For this purpose, the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been broadly used. To estimate the parameters of GEV distribution, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and L-moment estimation (LME) methods have been primarily employed. For a better estimation using the MLE, several studies considered the generalized MLE (penalized likelihood or Bayesian) methods to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information for parameters. However, a generalized LME method for the same purpose has not been developed yet in the literature. We thus propose the generalized method of L-moment estimation (GLME) to cooperate with a penalty function or prior information. The proposed estimation is based on the generalized L-moment distance and a multivariate normal likelihood approximation. Because the L-moment estimator is more efficient and robust for small samples than the MLE, we reasonably expect the advantages of LME to continue to hold for GLME. The proposed method is applied to the stationary and nonstationary GEV models with two novel (data-adaptive) penalty functions to correct the bias of LME. A simulation study indicates that the biases of LME are considerably corrected by the GLME with slight increases in the standard error. Applications to US flood damage data and maximum rainfall at Phliu Agromet in Thailand illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method. This study may promote further work on penalized or Bayesian inferences based on L-moments."}

Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms. Our implementations achieve high performance and resource efficiency: across six datasets and up to 128 GPUs, it reduces communication by up to 91% and improves training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x."}

Hash technique has shown its superiority for speeding up the online recommendation by bit operations on Hamming distance computations. However, existing hashing-based recommendations suffer from low accuracy, especially with sparse settings, due to the limited representation capability of each bit and neglected inherent relations among users and items. To this end, this paper lodges a Collaborative Group-Aware Hashing (CGAH) method for both collaborative filtering (namely CGAH-CF) and content-aware recommendations (namely CGAH) by integrating the inherent group information to alleviate the sparse issue. Firstly, we extract inherent group affinities of users and items by classifying their latent vectors into different groups. Then, the preference is formulated as the inner product of the group affinity and the similarity of hash codes. By learning hash codes with the inherent group information, CGAH obtains more effective hash codes than other discrete methods with sparse interactive data. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superior performance of our proposed CGAH and CGAH-CF over the state-of-the-art discrete collaborative filtering methods and discrete content-aware recommendations under different sparse settings."}

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents."}

Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average. NoD-DGMT significantly outperforms six baseline methods, with 16.8% relative improvement over the best baseline, and demonstrates consistent superiority across different model architectures and task complexities."}

In this study, we introduce Laser, a general framework for stabilizing and scaling agentic search. Laser defines a symbolic action protocol that organizes agent behaviors into three spaces: planning, task-solving, and retrospection. Each action is specified with explicit semantics and a deterministic execution format, enabling structured and logical reasoning processes and reliable action parsing. This design makes intermediate decisions interpretable and traceable, enhancing explicit retrospection and fine-grained control over reasoning trajectories. In coordination with parsable actions, Laser further maintains a compact context register that stores only essential states of the reasoning process, allowing the agent to reason over long horizons without uncontrolled context expansion. Experiments on Qwen2.5/3-series models across challenging multi-hop QA datasets show that Laser consistently outperforms existing agentic search baselines under both prompting-only and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating that Laser provides a principled and effective foundation for robust, scalable agentic search."}

Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues."}

By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand.

To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on.

Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.\n  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols.

While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models."}

Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery."}

This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives.

A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.\n  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \\emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \\emph{without} incurring the $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$ price of adaptivity.\n  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method.

While external knowledge-enhanced methods can alleviate the GLB, we identify a critical, unaddressed side effect: the Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), where a static knowledge base becomes progressively misaligned with the evolving model, turning guidance into noise. To address this dual challenge, we propose the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution. ASK breaks the GLB via multi-grained knowledge injection, systematically mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and introduces a novel adaptive reliability weighting scheme to ensure consistent knowledge contributes to optimization. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with superior, state-of-the-art performance justify the efficacy of our proposed ASK framework."}

We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions.

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications."}

On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal.

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

We propose a generalized approach to empirical Bayes based on the notion of probabilistic symmetry. Our method pairs a simultaneous inference problem-with an unknown prior-to a symmetry assumption on the joint distribution of the latent variables. Each symmetry implies an ergodic decomposition, which we use to derive a corresponding empirical Bayes method. We call this methodBayesian empirical Bayes (BEB). We show how BEB recovers the classical methods of empirical Bayes, which implicitly assume exchangeability. We then use it to extend EB to other probabilistic symmetries: (i) EB matrix recovery for arrays and graphs; (ii) covariate-assisted EB for conditional data; (iii) EB spatial regression under shift invariance. We develop scalable algorithms based on variational inference and neural networks. In simulations, BEB outperforms existing approaches to denoising arrays and spatial data.

In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios."}

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly."}

Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies"}

In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support."}

From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems."}

Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency.

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives."}

EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention."}

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal."}

The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return.

Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits.

The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.\n  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.\n  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making."}

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting."}

This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges."}

However, in real-network operation and maintenance scenarios, leveraging learning-based methods for BAC detection faces two critical challenges. Firstly, under the RESTful API design principles, most systems omit recording composite traffic for performance, and together with ethical and legal bans on directly testing real-world systems, this leads to a critical shortage of training data for detecting BAC violations. Secondly, common malicious behaviors such as SQL injection typically generate individual access traffic that is inherently anomalous. In contrast, BAC is usually composed of multiple correlated access requests that appear normal when examined in isolation. To tackle these problems, we introduce \\BAC, an approach for establishing a BAC violation detection model by generating and utilizing API traffic data.

We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length.

Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency.

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal."}

To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection.

In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets."}

The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions."}

This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making.

We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior."}

Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery."}

To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline.

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support."}

While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations.

In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step.

Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s).

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale."}

In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks."}

This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping."}

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively).

However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization."}

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior."}

We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction.

In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments."}

For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves."}

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks."}

We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists.

However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades."}

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM.

We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality.

While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME).

To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments."}

In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency.

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions."}

Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets."}

To address this, we introduce \\textbf{attention distance}, a novel metric that leverages a large language model's contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements and reveal their intrinsic connections. Under the same AFLGo configuration -- without altering any fuzzing components other than the distance metric -- replacing physical distances with attention distances across 38 real vulnerability reproduction experiments delivers a \\textbf{3.43$\\times$} average increase in testing efficiency over the traditional method.

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming."}

We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization."}

This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment.

In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.\n  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces.

Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL."}

During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks.

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal.

We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades."}

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions."}

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains."}

The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path.

We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data.

Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch.

Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy.

Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns.

Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields.

To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments."}

The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.\n  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows.

Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors.

Existing neuron interpretability techniques from NLP are suboptimal for source code due to programming languages formal, hierarchical, and executable nature. We empirically investigate code LLMs at the neuron level, localizing language-specific neurons (selectively responsive to one language) and concept layers (feed-forward layers encoding language-agnostic code representations). We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings."}

Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds."}

We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models."}

In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifier to generate API graph embeddings. The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset. However, graph-based deep learning models are vulnerable, as attackers can add fake relationships to evade detection by the classifier. Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers. Although the model initially fails to detect adversarial malware, retraining with generated adversarial samples improves robustness and helps mitigate adversarial attacks."}

As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network."}

To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control."}

Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks."}

Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets."}

To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data.

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming."}

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources."}

However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows."}

Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient.

E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.\n  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces.

Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies.

Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period."}

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches."}

PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves.

This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search.

To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches."}

In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them.

More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization."}

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models."}

We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks.

Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions."}

To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors.

In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments."}

Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types.

While external knowledge-enhanced methods can alleviate the GLB, we identify a critical, unaddressed side effect: the Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), where a static knowledge base becomes progressively misaligned with the evolving model, turning guidance into noise. To address this dual challenge, we propose the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution. ASK breaks the GLB via multi-grained knowledge injection, systematically mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and introduces a novel adaptive reliability weighting scheme to ensure consistent knowledge contributes to optimization.

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems."}

PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors.

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform."}

By applying spectral clustering to physicochemical features of monomers, we identified three distinct monomer groups with characteristic reactivity patterns. This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes.

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks."}

Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning."}

This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty."}

By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids."}

Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).\n  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.\n  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.\n  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis."}

Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions.

This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance.

To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data.

We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives."}

The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset.

Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers.

Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives."}

To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives.

The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation. A key objective is to quantify when stealth constraints make DoH exfiltration uneconomical and unworthy for the attacker."}

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13.

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches."}

This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \\citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization."}

Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!).

However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems."}

PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves.

Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization."}

Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance.

Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity.

Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails.

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP."}

A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.\n  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \\emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \\emph{without} incurring the $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$ price of adaptivity.\n  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals."}

While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited."}

I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \\textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS).

The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions."}

Book chapter", "summary": "Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference."}

Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\\eps \\in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \\ge Θ({n^4 \\log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \\asymp Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/\\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\\pth{d^{\\ell_0} \\max\\set{\\eps^{-2},\\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\\ell_0$ from the initial $L \\ge \\ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels."}

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics."}

The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories.
