At the other extreme, arbitrary correlations are\nequivalent to worst-case inputs via Yao's minimax principle, making good\nalgorithms often impossible. This motivates the study of intermediate models\nthat capture mild correlations while still permitting non-trivial algorithms.\n  In this paper, we study online combinatorial optimization under Markov Random\nFields (MRFs), a well-established graphical model for structured dependencies.\nMRFs parameterize correlation strength via the maximum weighted degree\n$\\Delta$, smoothly interpolating between independence ($\\Delta = 0$) and full\ncorrelation ($\\Delta \\to \\infty$). While na\\\"ively this yields\n$e^{O(\\Delta)}$-competitive algorithms and $\\Omega(\\Delta)$ hardness, we ask:\nwhen can we design tight $\\Theta(\\Delta)$-competitive algorithms?\n  We present general techniques achieving $O(\\Delta)$-competitive algorithms\nfor both minimization and maximization problems under MRF-distributed inputs.\nFor minimization problems with coverage constraints (e.g., Facility Location\nand Steiner Tree), we reduce to the well-studied $p$-sample model. For\nmaximization problems (e.g., matchings and combinatorial auctions with XOS\nbuyers), we extend the \"balanced prices\" framework for online allocation\nproblems to MRFs."}

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirements", "summary": "Fair allocation of indivisible goods is a fundamental problem at the\ninterface of economics and computer science. Traditional approaches focus\neither on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic\nallocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these\napproaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized\nallocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported\non approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that\nunder additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is\nex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one\ngood (EF1).\n  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness\nguarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful\nex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:\n  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive\nvaluations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed\nefficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally\nincompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.\nWe then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO\ntogether with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and\nleverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.\n  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX\nwhere some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated\npool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante\n0.5-EF.\n  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post\nguarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of\nagents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to\n0.5-proportionality."}

When the RLE\nsize $m$ is sufficiently small compared to $n$, our algorithm may show\nlinear-time behavior in $n$, potentially leading to improved performance over\nexisting methods in such cases."}

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirements", "summary": "Fair allocation of indivisible goods is a fundamental problem at the\ninterface of economics and computer science. Traditional approaches focus\neither on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic\nallocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these\napproaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized\nallocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported\non approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that\nunder additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is\nex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one\ngood (EF1).\n  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness\nguarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful\nex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:\n  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive\nvaluations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed\nefficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally\nincompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.\nWe then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO\ntogether with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and\nleverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.\n  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX\nwhere some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated\npool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante\n0.5-EF.\n  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post\nguarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of\nagents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to\n0.5-proportionality."}

In many cases the primary\nfunction attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management.\nAlthough much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource\nallocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be\nallocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are\nformulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of\neach of them, such as virtual machines. The present study addresses the problem\nof allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource\ndemands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource\nFairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without\nloop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of\nthe block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant\nResource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run\non the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness\nis a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of\nresource types for unlimited number of users."}

As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion.

In particular, it\nplays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As\nthese agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly\napproaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid\nrobots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes\nto autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises\nconcerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the\nrequirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research\ndirected toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave\nethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a\nrange of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.\nThis study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents\n(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning\narchitecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative\nreasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn\na reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant\npropositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They\nare designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these\nobligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute\nto the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and\ntheir moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a\nconcrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key\nethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and\ndemonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments."}

LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For\ncode summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by\nnine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our\nfindings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities\nfor both tasks, with \"smaller\" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not\nbeing able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM\nfrequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality."}

The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions.

To implement the approach, the\ninitial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the\ntraining sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an\nout-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL.

To address this gap, we\nconducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of\nLLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex\ntiming logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL\noptimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a\nspecific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on\nmetamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL\ncode optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization\neffectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more\ncomplex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.\n(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic\noperations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL\noptimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods\non RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow\noptimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the\nchallenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these\nfindings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL\ncode optimization."}

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to\noutputting classification results without providing a rationale for their\ndiagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot\nunderstand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and\nadoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals\nfrom the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large\nlanguage model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological\nfeatures from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT\nnumerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately\nempowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic\nreport.

Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval\naugmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice\nGuidelines.

We then formalize the dual test: define\nthe judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a\nprompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,\nand cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's\nfeasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style\nalignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward\nfor stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.\nThroughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the\nmeaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative\nadversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate\nactions."}

In particular, it\nplays a central role in the development of artificial autonomous agents. As\nthese agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly\napproaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid\nrobots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes\nto autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises\nconcerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the\nrequirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research\ndirected toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave\nethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a\nrange of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.\nThis study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents\n(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning\narchitecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative\nreasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn\na reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant\npropositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They\nare designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these\nobligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute\nto the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and\ntheir moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a\nconcrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key\nethical desiderata. This study presents a first implementation of an RBAMA and\ndemonstrates the potential of RBAMAs in initial experiments."}

Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models."}

Token reduction, which discards\nless important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance\nthe efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle\nunimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.\nConsidering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,\ntokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt\ntransformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a\nbalance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing\n(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and\ntemporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a\nlater stage.

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design."}

To\nbridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring\ntruthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific\ntextbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific\ndisciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of\nhigh-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed\nthrough systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection\nmethodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available\nscientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system\ncovering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,\nincorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate\nevaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve\nsuperior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths\ncompared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train\nLlama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which\nsignificantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average\nperformance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger\nand stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We\nrelease our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven\ntrained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research."}

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an\nend-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit\nreasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to\ncomplex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system\nframework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via\nreinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate\nembodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards\nbased on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are\ncompressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model\nfor robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on\nembodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct\nenables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction\nbehaviors in complex embodied AI tasks."}
