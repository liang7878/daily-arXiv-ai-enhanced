We evaluated BenchPress on annotated\nenterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically\nreduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our\nresults show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions\nenhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation\nrobustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress\noffers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL\nmodels on a given domain-specific workload.

In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which\npayoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for\nco-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where\ncomputational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a\ntelecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the\nprobability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and\nthe investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of\nuncertainty.

Our findings\nshow that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal\nrelationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.\nWhile there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality\nor merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings\nsupport the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language\nmodels in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed\ndecision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u67e5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u56e0\u679c\u9519\u89c9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u6709\u6b64\u9519\u89c9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u53ea\u590d\u5236\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5982\u56e0\u679c\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u5f15\u53d1\u8bf8\u591a\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u56e0\u679c\u9519\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa1000\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u96f6\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u65e0\u6839\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u56e0\u679c\u9519\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u662f\u590d\u5236\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u51fa\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002"}}

Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional\napportionment with no information about the future.

By computing similarities between query and item\n(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from\nlarge-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models\n(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs\nfor more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt\ndirect-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains\ninadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve\ntight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend\nto capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing\nthem toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries\nexhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance\ndegrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding\nModel (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation\nlearning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a\ndeep understanding of the original query, and then produces a\nreasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval.

Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking\nHarmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling\n(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.\nOur second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or\nfirst-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal\nfor resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \\times$\nless energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while\nretaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we\npropose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical\nsystem using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a\nkernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very\nlong-range sequences.

Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project\nmaintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the\nissue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,\nwhich may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and\nfixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more\nconcerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they\nprovide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other\nparts of the program.\n  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear\nrepeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different\nprograms, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our\ninvestigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise\nthe security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program\nanalysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key\nobservation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged\nto identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By\nexamining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify\nsimilar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,\nBugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.\nManual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid.

Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple\nuser representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user\ninterests.

The\nsecond is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to\ncapture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin\nwith a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then,\nwe attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we\npropose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named\nGemiRec.

This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over\ncomplete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).\nSecond, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of\negalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.\nEmpirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies\nshow that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus\nstatements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline\nmethods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u58f0\u660e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u58f0\u660e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u805a\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u610f\u89c1\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u653f\u7b56\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u4e8b\u524d\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5728MDP\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u4f7f\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\u798f\u5229\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u7b49\u4e3b\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u58f0\u660e\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u58f0\u660e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by\nSarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant\ncomputational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively,\nsimultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill\nqueuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of\nservice (QoS).\n  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic\nnature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid\ndecode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We\ntherefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces\nfair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks.

By abstracting interfaces through CXL, ScalePool structurally resolves\ninteroperability constraints, enabling heterogeneous cluster operation and\ncomposable resource disaggregation.

The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications.

The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems.

This thesis examines the impact of data pruning - specifically,\nremoving users with fewer than a specified number of interactions - on both\ndataset characteristics and algorithm performance. Five benchmark datasets were\nanalysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5,\n10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional\ncharacteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms.

A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)\nerror, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although\ndesigned as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error\nmessages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and\nexisting debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon\ntheir submissions after repeated TLE failures.\n  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in\nonline programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE\nerrors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix\nthem. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient\nalgorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and\ninefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely\nperformance issues.\n  Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair\ntool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework\nfor evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback\ngenerated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code\nedits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same\n1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the\nstrongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the\nplatform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684TLE\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u5de5\u5177Nettle\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6Nettle - Eval\uff0cNettle\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u8fbe98.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u7f16\u7a0b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0aTLE\u9519\u8bef\u96be\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f88\u591a\u7528\u6237\u653e\u5f03\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u67901000\u4e2aCodeforces\u542bTLE\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6839\u6e90\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Nettle\u548cNettle - Eval\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u4e0e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "TLE\u9519\u8bef\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u5faa\u73af\u7b49\uff1bNettle\u4fee\u590d\u738798.5%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b98\u65b9\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "conclusion": "Nettle\u548cNettle - Eval\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684TLE\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the\nmeasurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists\nof many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example\napplication areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC\ninstead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher\nPSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss\nreduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy\nof hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a\nstatistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional\nfidelity losses for inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08DC\uff09\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u805a\u5408\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DC\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u7ea7\u6821\u51c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u9010\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u4e14PSNR\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u624b\u5de5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DC\u635f\u5931\u662f\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u771f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

By leveraging the\nrepresentational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most\ninformative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI\nmethods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process\ntowards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically\nimplemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network\ntraining alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well\nsuited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are\ncommonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing\nmodel fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas\nof sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable\nmanner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed\nduring inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training\nproceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations\nincompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to\nround-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly\nreduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI\nachieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while\nmaintaining inference performance.

Based on the results, we select three\ntop-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation\non our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types\nand 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve\nreasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently\nfail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component\nenvironments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers\ncreate a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual\nvulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with\nperformance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.\nOur findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent\ncapabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,\nemphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous\nproblem-solving capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8Web\u6f0f\u6d1e\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6f0f\u6d1e\u590d\u73b0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u81ea\u52a8Web\u6f0f\u6d1e\u590d\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f3020\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u572816\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf93\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027Web\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9009\u53d63\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u572880\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684CVE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e93\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6307\u5bfc\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8533%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u590d\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Through controlled\nexperiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of\nscalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent\ntask data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform\nrigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM\nwith the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task\ndata-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \\textbf{Agentic\nSelf-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning\nframework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within\na shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,\na Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of\nharder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving.

Presence of\ninteraction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to\nanother target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed\nassignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables\nbetter decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug\ndoses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly\ndone from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on\nthe entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,\nwe introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call\ninteraction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine\nlearning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the\npopularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of\ncorrectly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show\nthe invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.\nSecondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding\ndrug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when\neither drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical\napplications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate\nside information on drugs and targets.

Based on the empirical insights, we\npropose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in\nboth MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to\nmaintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.\nIP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the\nmath reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising\ntheir other capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u843d\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8c03\u4f18\u7684IP - Merging\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cMLLM\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u843d\u540e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651MLLM\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIP - Merging\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u8bc6\u522bMLLM\u548c\u6570\u5b66LLM\u4e2d\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u5230MLLM\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u5e76\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIP - Merging\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u5b66LLM\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u4ed6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "IP - Merging\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.IR"], "comment": null, "summary": "In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two\ntypes of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the\npredicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary\nlabel prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

We show that these methods primarily employ a\n\\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the\ndiffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.\nWe describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling\nfrom these twisted distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u626d\u66f2\u673a\u5236\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u5168\u9762\u4e86\u89e3\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u626d\u66f2\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u626d\u66f2\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u626d\u66f2\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002"}}

For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior\ninformation explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on\nthe TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the\nthinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass\nRates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent\nSystems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from\nhigh reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long\nper-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short\nfor Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only\nintegrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,\ncompact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS\nthrough a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single\nsmall-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and\nplanning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly\noutperform it.

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating.

We\nintroduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link\nprediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning\nframework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach\nmodels a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram\ngraphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.\nEach edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities\nare aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,\na custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a\nunique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate\npath-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared\ntransformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating\nmechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level\nembeddings.

As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for\nreliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural\nand symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping\nlow-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning\ninfers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior\nknowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the\nconcepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning\nShortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the\nconcepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's\nexplanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore\nreliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless\nconcept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the\nliterature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and\npractitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview\naddresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing\ntheir causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and\nelucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,\nit details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness\nstrategies, and maps their benefits and limitations.

While their outputs\nare fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through\nstatistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment.

This paper\ncloses that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm\nconfiguration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic\nconfiguration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a\nseries of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without\ndegrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit\nexperimentally.

They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural\nLanguage Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and\nCLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,\nparticularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation\nmodels are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the\nsame type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time\nseries foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,\ntraffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive\nbenchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist\nmodels, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51\ntasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and\ncross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven\ndimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning\ngain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics\njointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,\nrobustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a\nholistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse\ndownstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the\nspecialist model achieves a 27% higher win score.

In particular, RC trains only\nthe output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in\nEdge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series\nanomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can\nlead to serious incidents.

In this study, to\nimprove the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning\nefficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the\nspectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism\n- with RC.

Moreover, because the SR\nmethod, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC\nsuggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series\nanomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08SR - RC\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08RC\uff09\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9700\u5927\u50a8\u5c42\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8db3\u591f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08SR - RC\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8c31\u6b8b\u5dee\uff08SR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRC\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "SR - RC\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRC\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u503c\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SR - RC\u4e3a\u5c06RC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Many existing\ndefences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies\nor when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,\na submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that\nevade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood\naround each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''\nfrom a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking\n(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By\naggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how\nfaithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such\ncharacteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose\nLAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves\nstate-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and\nlimited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per\nclass, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to\n14\\% in AUROC over the next-best method.

However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of\nscalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human\nlabeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte\nCarlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes\nand often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit\nmisattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,\nlow factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and\nfidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward\nnoise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured\nreasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated\nsupervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,\nproviding execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level\nvalidation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation\nmechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.\nFinally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative\nstructure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned\nLLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,\namounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with\nauto-labeled supervision.

We proposed a system based on NRF transceivers to\nestablish a strong Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), enabling transfer of\nreal-time data from multiple sensors to a central setup that is driven by\nARDUINO microcontrollers. Different key parameters, crucial for industrial\nsetup such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and fire detection, are\nmonitored and displayed on an LCD screen, enabling factory administration to\noversee the industrial operations remotely over the internet. Our proposed\nsystem bypasses the need for physical presence for monitoring by addressing the\nshortcomings of conventional wired communication systems. Other than\nmonitoring, there is an additional feature to remotely control these parameters\nby controlling the speed of DC motors through online commands. Given the rising\nincidence of industrial fires over the worldwide between 2020 and 2024 due to\nan array of hazards, this system with dual functionality boosts the overall\noperational efficiency and safety.

Generative modeling has long been used\nto predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated\nuncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological\nstructures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.\nThis study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of\ndeep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce\nfluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model\nthat mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments\nfrom the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly\ntransferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the\ngenerated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits\nwithout mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a\nprocess-based model to generate those training data allows us to include\nvaluable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the\ndeposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by\nchecking that its samples honor the law of superposition.

While recent advances in\ndynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by\nselectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on\ngreedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to\nirreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper\nintroduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these\nissues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance\nbut also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be\napproximated.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments.

Recently, scaling\nof the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.\nWhile verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely\nunaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a\nlatency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,\nFR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the\ntarget model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.\nAlthough this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency\nlists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static\nshortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected\nnumber of tokens per verification step.

This paper\nintroduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual\nconsistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.\nConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical\nquestions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed\nwithout involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial\nevaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with\nprompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query\n100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different\npersona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We\nprocessed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine\nsimilarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine\nsimilarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,\nscores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as\na benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several\nlightweight models rank lowest.

However, current\ncounterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including\ngradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the\nalignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation\nalgorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable\nand informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries\ndiverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to\nmodels with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop\nsystems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that\nrequire the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We\nprovide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that\nLeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations\nthat offer actionable insights.

This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM\nframework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the\nconversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into\neducation by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,\nwe analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged\nbetween PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across\nthree U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we\ngenerate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,\nClaude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and\nlearning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are\nfused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across\nmodels to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during\ninteraction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect\nand moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and\ncuriosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while\nless common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress.

However, when applied\nto machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates\nof the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such\nshortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and\ntasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian\nRepresentation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates\northogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary\nnonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation\nbackpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that\nconceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints\naccount for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental\nresults show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic\nplasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call\nLearned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary\nfeatures represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and\ndecision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language\nModels (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a\nremarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We\npropose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we\ndesign an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly\ngenerate predictors.

For any token, the model can request additional compute\nsteps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a\nspecialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the\nmodel with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can\nrequest multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs\njudiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each\noutput token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the\nclass of methods as $\\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three\nmethods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,\nwhere an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over\ntime; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction\naccuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP\nimposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning\nexperiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs\nonly one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to\nachieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and\na cross-entropy loss.

Handover in multi-RAT deployments is\nstill highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous\nmeasurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning\n(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a\nmodel-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a\ngeneralized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,\nwhich standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision\nlogic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a\nrealistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along\nrandomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated\nunder different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated\ncoverage.

Hallucination and inflation ratios\nreveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human\nannotators.

Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn\nattacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that\neither fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize\nrisk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the\nunderstanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a\nstructured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.\nFirst, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak\nstrategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad\nfamilies, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive\noverload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning.

Existing\nstudies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn\nstructural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain\nknowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based\nKGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,\nthe intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,\nleading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to\nmodel reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to\nfully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the\ncredibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a\nKnowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination\nbetween LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,\nwe design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL\ntokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a\nKRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG\ncontext through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a\nstructure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains\nthe reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain.

This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the\nbelief that the claim defended is false.

Debaters were asked to select their preferred\nposition, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict\nwith their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt\nsycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to\nmaximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We\nimplemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to\nevaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were\nmore persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions\nconsistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main\nfindings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the\njudge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces\nsignificant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when\ndefending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,\narguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise\ncomparison.

One\nsuccessful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric\nconstraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this\nwork, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language\nmodel outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a\nsignature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given\noutput. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from\nexisting model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In\nparticular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model\nparameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities\n(logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring,\nsince all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the\nsignature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the\nmodel inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and\nredundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the\nmodel.

Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources", "categories": ["astro-ph.IM", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of\nastrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and\ninformative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source\nCatalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains\nlargely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and\nphysically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep\nlearning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant\ninformation, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and\ninterpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress\nX-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only\nhigh-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary\nstatistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned\nrepresentation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering\nperformance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with\nphysical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density\n($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent\nvariables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification\naccuracy of $\\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\\sim$69% when\nrestricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively.

In this paper, we propose\nFlip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves\nrobustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The\nfirst, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt\nvariations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation\nalignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward\nthe consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We\nevaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt\nvariations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,\nimproves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats\nby 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,\nincreasing $\\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most\nsource-target pairs.

As one of the leading signs of AD, language\ncapability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I\ndevelop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and\nfine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early\ndetection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word\nvectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The\nscores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic\ncontext of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic\nfeatures to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature\nvector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the\npipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,\nmodel regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and\nvector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under\nthe Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based\non my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best\nexisting NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32].

To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer\ncontrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)\nselect a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)\nidentify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the\nlayer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding\nto generate the final output.

While this\npattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with\nthe prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no\nreference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference\ncost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive\nexperiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves\ntext-image alignment across diverse prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u83b7\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u63d0\u70bc\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u51c6\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5c0f\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Such datasets are naturally\ndescribed as multi-resolution clusterings, i.e., not necessarily hierarchical\nsequences of partitions across scales. To analyse and compare such sequences,\nwe use tools from topological data analysis and define the Multiscale\nClustering Bifiltration (MCbiF), a 2-parameter filtration of abstract\nsimplicial complexes that encodes cluster intersection patterns across scales.\nThe MCbiF can be interpreted as a higher-order extension of Sankey diagrams and\nreduces to a dendrogram for hierarchical sequences. We show that the\nmultiparameter persistent homology (MPH) of the MCbiF yields a finitely\npresented and block decomposable module, and its stable Hilbert functions\ncharacterise the topological autocorrelation of the sequence of partitions. In\nparticular, at dimension zero, the MPH captures violations of the refinement\norder of partitions, whereas at dimension one, the MPH captures higher-order\ninconsistencies between clusters across scales.

Building on this, we examine\nnorm evolution across a $2\\times2$ grid of environmental and social\ninitialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and\nbenchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these\nconditions.

Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nour attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack\nsuccess rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes.\nOur work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs\nand contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for\nopen-source platforms in the era of foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u52a9\u529b\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cc\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6c60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u89e6\u53d1\u8282\u70b9\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u89e6\u53d1\u8282\u70b9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u853d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\u5f00\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/LaSeR", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior\nstudies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into\nthe standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification\ncapabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on\nthis insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token\nSelf-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with\na MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based\nreasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding\ncapabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in\nboth training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm\nderives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of\nthe last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra\ncost of one additional token inference.

We present STANCE, an image-to-video\nframework that addresses both issues with two simple components.

Control Barrier Functions\n(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally\ndeployed \\emph{online} via safety filters.

This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating\nsafe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \\emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key\nattributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety\nconstraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in\ntraining. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be\ndeployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,\nwe demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned\npolicy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --\nenabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We\nvalidate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster\nconvergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid\nrobot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without\na runtime safety filter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCBF - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u5b89\u5168\u6765\u8ffd\u6c42\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cCBF\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCBF - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7CBF\u9879\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fee\u6539\u6807\u79f0RL\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u5f00\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u660eCBF - RL\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "CBF - RL\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u548c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u907f\u969c\u548c\u722c\u697c\u68af\u3002"}}

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches).

These findings\nestablish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical\nscaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning\nenhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCOIG - Writer\u4e2d\u6587\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f97\u51fa\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e09\u70b9\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u521b\u610f\u6e90\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCOIG - Writer\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1665\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d651\u79cd\u4f53\u88c1\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u901a\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff1b\u521b\u610f\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6587\u5316\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u521b\u610f\u8d28\u91cf\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521b\u610f\u5353\u8d8a\u6e90\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Each year, more than 300 million computed\ntomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for\neffective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on\nthese CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence\n(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such\nmodels typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines\nof tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,\nrequiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT\nscan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing\nthe tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology\nresults--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI\ntraining. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match\ntheir descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with\nlarge collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing\nthe need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI\nmodels achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks.

While recent\npointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great\nprogress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic\nscenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving\nobjects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the\nreconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages\ntemporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to\n4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of\ncorrespondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters.
