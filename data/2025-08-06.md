### [1] [Board Game Arena: A Framework and Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models via Strategic Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03368)
*Lucia Cipolina-Kun,Marianna Nezhurina,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍Board Game Arena库，它可通过战略棋盘游戏评估大语言模型决策能力，支持多种游戏场景对比、模型接入及分布式执行，还提供分析工具，总结其结构等并强调对评估LLM推理和博弈行为的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大语言模型决策能力评估提供一个框架，以便在战略棋盘游戏场景下对LLM进行系统评估。

Method: 通过封装多种棋盘和矩阵游戏，支持不同类型的代理，集成API访问模型、本地模型部署，并利用Ray进行分布式执行，还提供分析工具。

Result: 构建了Board Game Arena库，可在各种游戏场景中对基于LLM的代理和其他代理进行系统比较，并提供推理跟踪的分析工具。

Abstract: The Board Game Arena library provides a framework for evaluating the decision
making abilities of large language models (LLMs) through strategic board games
implemented in Google OpenSpiel library. The framework enables systematic
comparisons between LLM based agents and other agents (random, human,
reinforcement learning agents, etc.) in various game scenarios by wrapping
multiple board and matrix games and supporting different agent types. It
integrates API access to models via LiteLLM, local model deployment via vLLM,
and offers distributed execution through Ray. Additionally it provides
extensive analysis tools for the LLM reasoning traces. This paper summarizes
the structure, key characteristics, and motivation of the repository,
highlighting how it contributes to the empirical evaluation of the reasoning of
LLM and game-theoretic behavior

*Ningning Wang,Xavier Hu,Pai Liu,He Zhu,Yue Hou,Heyuan Huang,Shengyu Zhang,Jian Yang,Jiaheng Liu,Ge Zhang,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型驱动的智能体系统效率与效果的权衡，提出Efficient Agents框架，在保持性能的同时降低成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型驱动的智能体成本上升威胁可扩展性和可访问性，需要在不牺牲性能的前提下进行成本效益设计

Method: 在GAIA基准上进行实证分析，评估大语言模型骨干选择、智能体框架设计和测试时扩展策略，用成本通过率指标量化效率与性能的权衡

Result: Efficient Agents框架保留了OWL 96.7%的性能，将运营成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，成本通过率提高28.4%

Conclusion: 为设计高效、高性能的智能体系统提供了可行的见解，推动了人工智能驱动解决方案的可访问性和可持续性

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

### [3] [Planning with Dynamically Changing Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02697)
*Mikhail Soutchanski,Yongmei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对无领域封闭假设（DCA）的规划问题，提出基于一阶逻辑的规划方法并证明其合理性与完备性，还讨论了概念验证实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典规划和一致性规划中的DCA假设不适用于对象集合会动态变化的实际规划问题，因此需要新的规划方法。

Method: 用一阶逻辑表述规划问题，假设初始理论是有限一致的流文字集合，限制可能动作数量和计划长度，对规划时已实例化的动作序列进行搜索。

Result: 证明了所提方法的合理性和完备性，可用于解决无DCA的有界规划问题。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决特定条件下无DCA的规划问题，并讨论了概念验证实现。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

### [4] [Recovering Individual-Level Activity Sequences from Location-Based Service Data Using a Novel Transformer-Based Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02734)
*Weiyu Luo,Chenfeng Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出VSNIT模型解决LBS数据活动序列不完整问题，实验表明该模型在恢复活动序列上准确性和多样性优越，有提升LBS数据效用的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS数据稀疏导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断出行和活动，需用高质量LBS数据恢复个体层面不完整的活动序列。

Method: 提出Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion Transformer (VSNIT)，结合插入Transformer的灵活序列构建和变量选择网络的动态协变量处理能力，在保留现有数据的同时恢复不完整活动序列中的缺失片段。

Result: VSNIT插入更多样、真实的活动模式，更贴合现实变化，能更有效地恢复中断的活动转换，各项指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中准确性和多样性优越，能提升LBS数据在移动性分析中的效用，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

visualization, etc. Our work offers two key contributions: (1) a comprehensive
review of recent developments in applying LLMbased agents to data science
tasks; (2) a dual-perspective framework that connects general agent design
principles with the practical workflows in data science.

### [6] [Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization: Self-Adaptive Reasoning for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789)
*Newman Cheng,Gordon Broadbent,William Chappell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CLIO方法让大语言模型在科学发现中实现推理过程的深度精确控制，在生物学和医学问题上提升了GPT - 4.1的准确率，还揭示了内部不确定性振荡对结果准确性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI发展模式无法满足科学家在科学发现中对AI推理准确性、透明度和可操控性的需求。

Method: 引入认知循环原位优化（CLIO）方法，使大语言模型能自我制定解决问题的方式、在自信度低时调整行为。

Result: 未经过进一步训练，GPT - 4.1结合CLIO在HLE测试中的准确率达22.37%，比基础模型提升显著，且超过OpenAI的o3性能。

Conclusion: CLIO的开放设计和内部机制能为科学决策过程提供洞察和控制，内部不确定性振荡是决定结果准确性的关键。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

### [7] [A Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning in Radiology Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02841)
*Ziruo Yi,Jinyu Liu,Ting Xiao,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用于RVQA的多智能体系统，在挑战性数据集上验证其效果，凸显多智能体方法在临床AI应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLMs和RAG的RVQA方法存在事实准确性、幻觉和跨模态不对齐等问题。

Method: 引入多智能体系统（MAS），包含上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的专门智能体，并在通过模型分歧过滤策划的挑战性RVQA集上评估。

Result: 实验表明系统优于强大的MLLM基线，案例研究显示其可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法有潜力支持需要复杂推理的可解释和可信临床AI应用。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

### [8] [Seemingly Simple Planning Problems are Computationally Challenging: The Countdown Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02900)
*Michael Katz,Harsha Kokel,Sarath Sreedharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有规划基准不足以衡量基础模型和智能体的规划能力，本文提出基于Countdown游戏的规划基准，分析其优势并评估现有方法，该基准对现有基于大语言模型的方法极具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准存在不足，难以真正衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力。

Method: 提出围绕Countdown游戏创建规划基准的程序，进行理论分析并与公共基准对比，用该程序生成的实例评估现有大语言模型辅助规划方法。

Result: 证明该基准计算复杂度高，实例空间丰富，对现有基于大语言模型的方法具有很大挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的基于Countdown游戏的动态基准能有效评估规划能力，优于现有基准。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

### [9] [Enhancing Japanese Large Language Models with Reasoning Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02913)
*Carolina Minami Oguchi,Leo Wei,Koyo Kobayashi,Hsin-Tai Wu,Dipak Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出用推理向量提升日语大语言模型性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流大语言模型可通过训练后方法提升性能和推理能力，但日语大语言模型因资源问题难以做到。

Method: 从推理大语言模型中获取推理向量并应用到日语大语言模型。

Result: 实现了日语大语言模型的显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出了简单有效的提升方法，有望启发其他语言模型。

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

### [10] [PentestJudge: Judging Agent Behavior Against Operational Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02921)
*Shane Caldwell,Max Harley,Michael Kouremetis,Vincent Abruzzo,Will Pearce*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍PentestJudge系统评估渗透测试代理操作，开发评分规则，对比LLM与人类专家表现，评估多模型，发现工具使用好的模型更接近人类，不同模型对不同问题表现不同，弱模型可验证强模型，分享方法促进未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决安全代理操作标准难以通过编程评估的问题，促进对基于AI的信息安全代理过程质量评估的研究，使其能在敏感生产环境使用。

Method: 引入PentestJudge系统，用树结构将渗透测试任务分解为子任务和标准，对比LLM评分与人类专家评分，使用标准二元分类指标评估。

Result: 评估多个模型，最佳模型F1分数达0.83，工具使用好的模型更接近人类专家，不同模型对不同类型问题表现不同，弱模型可验证强模型。

Conclusion: 分享的方法有助于未来研究对基于AI的信息安全代理过程质量进行全面、可扩展的评估。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

*Songkun Yan,Zhi Li,Siyu Zhu,Yixin Wen,Mofan Zhang,Mengye Chen,Jie Cao,Yang Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了用于水文建模的端到端语言代理AQUAH，它能自动完成多项任务，早期实验有积极结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计专门用于水文建模的端到端语言代理，简化复杂环境建模，降低地球观测数据、基于物理的工具和决策者之间的障碍。

Method: 利用具有视觉能力的大语言模型，根据自然语言提示，自动检索数据、配置模型、运行模拟并生成报告。

Result: 在一系列美国流域的初始实验中，AQUAH能自动完成冷启动模拟并生成分析报告，结果被水文专家认为清晰、透明且符合物理原理。

Conclusion: 虽然还需进一步校准和验证，但基于大语言模型、有视觉基础的代理在简化复杂环境建模方面有前景。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

*Mahtab Bigverdi,Wisdom Ikezogwo,Kevin Zhang,Hyewon Jeong,Mingyu Lu,Sungjae Cho,Linda Shapiro,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 引入Medblink基准测试多模态语言模型感知能力，评估19个模型，结果显示当前模型常失败，需加强视觉基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生采用AI工具较谨慎，模型在简单感知任务出错则难用于临床，需评估模型感知能力。

Method: 引入Medblink基准，涵盖8个临床任务、多成像模式和解剖区域，有1429个选择题、1605张图像，评估19个先进多模态语言模型。

Result: 人类注释者准确率96.4%，最佳模型仅65%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态语言模型常无法通过常规感知检查，需加强视觉基础以支持临床应用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有方法构建通用代理存在局限，本文提出自优化代理Polymath，用无标签数据优化工作流，实验显示有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动嵌入基础模型构建通用代理可扩展性和效率受限，现有基于代码表示自动生成和优化工作流的方法依赖标签数据，难以解决现实动态问题。

Method: 提出Polymath，利用任务流图和代码表示工作流的优势，结合多网格启发式图优化和自我反思引导的进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集的编码、数学和多轮问答任务上，Polymath比现有基线平均提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath能有效解决一系列现实动态问题，在无标签数据情况下优化工作流并取得较好效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型工具生态碎片化，开发者面临多协议、手动模式定义和复杂执行流程挑战。

Method: 提出统一工具集成方法，采用协议无关设计原则，通过自动模式生成、双模式并发执行和无缝多源工具管理。

Result: 集成场景代码减少60 - 80%，优化并发使性能提升达3.1倍，与现有函数调用标准完全兼容。

Conclusion: 此工作为工具集成架构提供理论见解，为实际大语言模型应用开发提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型能力和自主性提升，评估其输出成关键瓶颈，需新评估范式。

Method: 定义‘以智能体为评判者’概念，追溯其从单模型评判到多智能体辩论框架的演变，对比不同方法在可靠性、成本和人类对齐等方面表现，调研现实应用。

Result: 对比了不同评估方法，调研了医学、法律等领域的现实应用。

Conclusion: 基于智能体的评判可补充但不能取代人类监督，是迈向可靠、可扩展评估下一代大语言模型的一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言推理模型在交互式环境多轮代理规划中，面临信用分配问题和推理历史计算开销大的挑战。

Method: 提出BPO三阶段框架，包括引导、外推和细化。先使用规划四元数和长短思维链融合进行高效推理，再通过复杂度分层课程学习外推到分布外任务，最后通过奖励门控拒绝采样选择的经验迭代细化模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进水平，具有显著的令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO框架为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新方案。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体策略学习框架Collab - Solver解决MILP问题，提升求解性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块策略学习，未考虑相互依赖，影响求解速度和质量。

Method: 提出Collab - Solver框架，将割平面选择和分支的协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式。

Result: 联合学习的策略显著提升了合成和大规模真实世界MILP数据集的求解性能，且有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab - Solver框架有效，能协同优化多模块策略。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT - 2能有效学习元ODE算法，收敛行为与欧拉方法相当或更好，随着示例数量增加有指数级精度提升，且能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 这些实证结果为NLP中ICL的机制及其解决非线性数值问题的潜力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Result: 在真实医疗数据实验中，该框架性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Tree-of-Reasoning框架能有效提升复杂医疗场景下多智能体的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型越狱攻击防御方法依赖浅层模式匹配，难以泛化到新的攻击策略。

Method: 提出CDD框架，通过元操作针对越狱提示的底层结构，模拟人类认知推理，采用监督微调学习已知模式，引入熵引导强化学习算法增强对未知威胁的泛化能力。

Result: CDD能实现最先进的防御性能，对未知越狱攻击有很强的泛化性。

Conclusion: CDD框架在防御大语言模型越狱攻击方面有效且泛化性好，可用于安全可靠部署大语言模型。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: 大语言模型在法律风险分析等专业领域潜力待挖掘，人们对本地部署开源大语言模型进行法律任务且保护数据机密性兴趣渐增。

Method: 使用Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)评估4个专有和15个开源大语言模型。

Conclusion: 多数大语言模型表现与初级法律助理相当，开源模型需针对性微调，ContractEval为法律领域大语言模型未来发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Method: 提出AHSD公式，证明其目标函数特性，提出EoH - S方法，有互补种群管理和互补感知模因搜索机制。

Result: 在三个AHD任务上实验，EoH - S始终优于现有方法，性能提升达60%。

Conclusion: EoH - S能有效生成高质量互补启发式集，在AHD中表现出色。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成UEs的方法存在隐私悖论，即用户为保护数据需先将其暴露给第三方服务，阻碍了实用可扩展数据保护方案的发展。

Method: 引入Text - to - Unlearnable Example (T2UE)框架，利用文本到图像（T2I）模型将文本描述映射到图像（噪声）空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效不可学习噪声。

Result: T2UE保护的数据大幅降低了下游任务（如跨模态检索）中现有模型的性能，保护效果在不同架构和监督学习设置中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 证明了“零接触数据保护”的可行性，即仅基于文本描述就能保护个人数据，无需直接暴露数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Method: 引入适用于面向服务架构的增强UML序列图，集成决策表和API规范；引入数据依赖推理任务，将其形式化为约束数学推理任务，并进行静态解析和依赖剪枝

Result: 未提及

Conclusion: 未提及

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of

proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Conclusion: 本研究为提高代理学习能力和启发智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建用于优化建模的可信大语言模型代理，解决现实世界优化应用问题。

Method: 使用可验证合成数据生成管道，引入OptiTrust进行多阶段翻译，利用逐步演示、多语言推理和多数投票交叉验证。

Result: 在标准基准测试中取得SOTA表现，7个数据集中6个达到最高准确率，3个比次优算法至少高8个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建用于现实世界优化应用的可靠大语言模型代理提供了可扩展、可验证和有原则的途径。

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Motivation: 探究AI模型弥补大学生环境教育知识差距的潜力，评估其在传达环境概念和促进环境教育方面的有效性。

Method: 使用标准化工具环境知识测试（EKT - 19）并补充针对性问题，对比大学生和AI模型的环境知识。

Result: AI模型有庞大、易获取且有效的知识库，能赋能学生和教职工，但需环境科学专业人员验证信息准确性。

Conclusion: AI模型在环境教育中有潜力，但仍需人类专业人员确保信息准确。

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated
from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship
is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous
identification algorithms from the recent causal inference literature. The

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在正式几何推理，尤其是动态构建和验证辅助几何元素方面存在困难，而数学几何推理对科研和教育发展至关重要。

Method: 引入Geoint - R1多模态推理框架，集成辅助元素构建、通过Lean4进行形式推理和交互式可视化；提出包含1885个严格注释几何问题的Geoint基准。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Geoint - R1显著超越现有多模态和数学特定推理模型，在需要明确辅助元素构造的难题上表现突出。

Conclusion: Geoint - R1框架和Geoint基准有效提升了正式几何推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Abstract: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However,
most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments
with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants,
encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting
learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent.
Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of
learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with
Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior
knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing
different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of
InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with
different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent
allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based
learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有任务需对实体交互进行建模，传统时间序列预测方法不适用，现有时间图方法有局限。

Method: 引入全历史图，设计Edge - Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet)，包含图注意力模块、多头时间注意力模块和融合模块。

Result: 在司机意图预测和比特币欺诈检测任务中，ETDNet超越强基线，提升准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 在单个图中用不同边表示结构和时间关系有益。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Motivation: 现有工具增强视觉问答研究在现实工具使用能力上有差距，需更好数据集。

Method: 提出ToolEngine数据生成管道，用深度优先搜索和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理，构建ToolVQA数据集。

Result: 在测试集表现出色，在多种分布外数据集上超越GPT - 3.5 - turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA数据集能有效提升模型在现实工具使用场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: 现有大语言模型在长上下文记忆存在局限，本文提出新型自组织记忆架构Nemori，实验显示其性能优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文交互中无法维持持久记忆，现有记忆系统在记忆粒度和知识提取机制方面存在局限。

Method: 提出Two - Step Alignment Principle解决记忆粒度问题，提出Predict - Calibrate Principle实现自适应知识进化。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，在长上下文中优势更明显。

Conclusion: Nemori为处理自主智能体的长期动态工作流提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

Conclusion: 该方案是LLM - 基于AI代理在动态边缘环境的有效部署和管理解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Conclusion: 该方法对大语言模型实际部署和推理结构理解有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床有用且语言鲁棒的语音认知评估工具迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在通用逻辑推理上有挑战，神经符号AI受关注，但两种主要方法在通用基准测试上研究不足，需比较哪种方法对开发通用逻辑推理更有前景。

Result: 混合方法推理链更具可解释性，保留现有大语言模型能力和优势。

Conclusion: 混合方法对开发通用逻辑推理更有前景，提出基于LLM - SS的可泛化框架。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Result: 在多个数学推理任务实验中，HSG显著提升错误诊断能力，比GPT - 4o等基线模型准确率高16.8% - 31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG能有效提升大语言模型的错误诊断能力，发布的数据集可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的方法在处理不可行路由优化模型修改时，未考虑多种潜在调整，需填补此空白。

Method: 在自动路由求解器中结合大语言模型代理和多目标优化，用多目标优化生成权衡解，用大语言模型代理生成解决方案分析函数诊断原不可行模型。

Result: 在50种不可行路由问题上与多种基于大语言模型的方法对比，MOID单次运行可自动生成多个诊断建议。

Conclusion: MOID相比现有方法能为恢复模型可行性和决策提供更实用的见解。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

TL;DR: 本文引入以有向加权图表示信念系统的最小形式化方法，能丰富认知状态分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信念系统表示方法存在掩盖内部结构、混淆外部可信度与内部连贯性等问题，需新方法。

Method: 将信念系统表示为有向加权图，节点代表信念，边编码认知关系，用两个函数分别赋予信念可信度和置信度。

Result: 该模型不假设先验连贯性或要求信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，能区分信念结构和强度。

Conclusion: 此形式化方法比现有方法能对认知状态进行更丰富的分类，为分析信念系统内部组织提供基础。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的SmartGen框架合成上下文感知用户行为数据，提升智能家居模型在行为漂移下性能，实验表明显著提升异常检测和行为预测任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能家居模型基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移，且收集新数据用于再训练不切实际。

Method: SmartGen框架包含时间和语义感知分割模块、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常值过滤四个关键组件。

Result: 在三个真实数据集实验中，SmartGen显著提升异常检测和行为预测任务性能，异常检测平均提高85.43%，行为预测平均提高70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen能有效支持下游智能家居模型持续适应，提升其在行为漂移下的性能。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文引入EDCIM方法解决大语言模型在可解释数学任务中的错误，结合不同模型平衡成本与准确性，实验显示能降低成本并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多步推理中中间步骤易出错、存在幻觉且难以遵循输出格式，在可解释数学任务中问题突出。

Method: EDCIM方法利用大语言模型生成方程组，通过符号错误检测框架识别错误并提供反馈，集成轻量级开源模型和强大的专有模型，用单个超参数控制平衡。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，EDCIM能显著降低计算和财务成本，在平衡配置适当时可维持甚至提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM是一种有效的可解释数学任务错误检测和纠正方法，能平衡成本与准确性。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer训练中大规模激活的发展进行全面分析，发现其出现遵循可预测的数学模式，还开发框架预测数学参数，为模型设计提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作仅关注全训练模型中的大规模激活现象，对其训练期间的时间动态了解不足，因此开展全面分析。

Method: 以Pythia模型家族为测试平台，对不同大小的模型在多个训练检查点进行系统分析，开发机器学习框架从架构规格预测数学参数。

Result: 大规模激活的出现遵循可通过含五个关键参数的指数调制对数函数准确建模的数学模式，预测框架对稳态行为有高精度，对出现时间和幅度有中等精度。

Conclusion: 大规模激活的出现受模型设计支配，在训练开始前可预测并可能控制。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型代码生成能力提升，但对输入前提依赖增强，输入含错误前提时代码生成幻觉概率大增，自我审查能力不足，因此需要评估框架。

Method: 构建三类错误前提，集成多维度评估指标，对15个代表性大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 多数模型在错误前提推理和代码生成差，依赖显式提示检测错误；错误前提使资源投入收益递减；三类错误前提激活不同缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 强调大语言模型在代码生成中主动验证前提的紧迫性，FPBench框架和评估系统为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供理论基础和实践途径。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Motivation: 现有引力波信号识别算法（如MF和DNNs）存在局限性，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出Evo - MCTS框架，结合树结构搜索、进化优化和大语言模型启发式，通过领域感知物理约束进行算法空间探索。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升性能，还发现新算法组合，为计算科学领域自动算法发现提供可转移方法。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Conclusion: 该框架具有用于现实世界智能体训练和部署的潜力。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率和量子领域使用的决策图（DDs）采用浮点数计算存在舍入误差，影响结果正确性和压缩效果，矩阵向量乘法对概率和量子系统很重要，需研究其数值稳定性。

Method: 对MTBDD矩阵向量乘法的数值稳定性进行理论证明，并开展量子电路仿真的数值误差案例研究。

Result: 证明MTBDD矩阵向量乘法算法在特定条件下可数值稳定，但实际中很多MTBDD实现不满足这些条件；量子电路仿真中数值误差程度因实例而异。

Conclusion: MTBDD矩阵向量乘法算法有数值稳定的可能性，但实际应用存在条件不满足的问题，不同实例的数值误差差异大。

Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) are a powerful data structure that is used to tackle
the state-space explosion problem, not only for discrete systems, but for
probabilistic and quantum systems as well. While many of the DDs used in the
probabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is
not without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small
rounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the
effectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the
numerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical
errors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision
diagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest
because it is the function that computes successor states for both
probabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector
multiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain
conditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these
conditions are not met. Additionally, we provide a case study of the numerical
errors in the simulation of quantum circuits, which shows that the extent of
numerical errors in practice varies greatly between instances.

Conclusion: 理论和实验结果缩小了经典迭代求解器和基于优化的求解器的性能差距，凸显了损失条件的核心作用，为设计更高效的PDE求解器提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have
gained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the
loss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),
or indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge
much more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as
inefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the
inefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly
forms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs
optimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual
(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition
number between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to
the MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence
behavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL
framework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and
compare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical
experiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL
framework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster
convergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework
shows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently
outperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge
the performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based
solvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key
insights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate the numerical-experimental
mechanical behavior modeling of the recycled polymer, that is, recyclable
polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), manufactured by a deposition FFF process
under compressive stresses for new sustainable designs. In all, 42 test
specimens were manufactured and analyzed according to the ASTM D695-15
standards. Eight numerical analyzes were performed on a real design
manufactured with rPET using Young's compression modulus from the experimental
tests. Finally, eight additional experimental tests under uniaxial compression
loads were performed on the real sustainable design for validating its
mechanical behavior versus computational numerical tests. As a result of the
experimental tests, rPET behaves linearly until it reaches the elastic limit,
along each manufacturing axis. The results of this study confirmed the design's
structural safety by the load scenario and operating boundary conditions.
Experimental and numerical results show a difference of 0.001-0.024 mm,
allowing for the rPET to be configured as isotropic in numerical simulation
software without having to modify its material modeling equations. The results
obtained are of great help to industry, designers and researchers because they
validate the use of recycled rPET for the ecological production of
real-sustainable products using MEX technology under compressive stress and its
configuration for numerical simulations. Major design companies are now using
recycled plastic materials in their high-end designs. Validation results have
been presented on test specimens and real items, comparing experimental
material configuration values with numerical results.

Abstract: Soft-walled microchannels arise in many applications, ranging from
organ-on-a-chip platforms to soft-robotic actuators. However, despite extensive
research on their static and dynamic response, the potential failure of these
devices has not been addressed. To this end, we explore fluid--structure
interaction in microchannels whose compliant top wall is governed by a nonlocal
mechanical theory capable of simulating both deformation and material failure.
We develop a one-dimensional model by coupling viscous flow under the
lubrication approximation to a state-based peridynamic formulation of an
Euler--Bernoulli beam. The peridynamic formulation enables the wall to be
modeled as a genuinely nonlocal beam, and the integral form of its equation of
motion remains valid whether the deformation field is smooth or contains
discontinuities. Through the proposed computational model, we explore the
steady and time-dependent behaviors of this fluid--peridynamic structure
interaction. We rationalize the wave and damping dynamics observed in the
simulations through a dispersion (linearized) analysis of the coupled system,
finding that, with increasing nonlocal influence, wave propagation exhibits a
clear departure from classical behavior, characterized by a gradual suppression
of the phase velocity. The main contribution of our study is to outline the
potential failure scenarios of the microchannel's soft wall under the
hydrodynamic load of the flow. Specifically, we find a dividing curve in the
space spanned by the dimensionless Strouhal number (quantifying unsteady
inertia of the beam) and the compliance number (quantifying the strength of the
fluid--structure coupling) separating scenarios of potential failure during
transient conditions from potential failure at the steady load.

Abstract: The core challenge in automotive exterior design is balancing subjective
aesthetics with objective aerodynamic performance while dramatically
accelerating the development cycle. To address this, we propose a novel,
LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates the end-to-end workflow from
ambiguous requirements to 3D concept model performance validation. The workflow
is structured in two stages: conceptual generation and performance validation.
In the first stage, agents collaborate to interpret fuzzy design requirements,
generate concept sketches, and produce photorealistic renderings using
diffusion models. In the second stage, the renderings are converted to 3D point
clouds, where a Drag Prediction Agent, built upon a lightweight surrogate
model, provides near-instantaneous predictions of the drag coefficient and
pressure fields, replacing time-consuming CFD simulations. The primary
contribution of this work is the seamless integration of creative generation
with a rapid engineering validation loop within a unified, automated system,
which provides a new paradigm for efficiently balancing creative exploration
with engineering constraints in the earliest stages of design.

Abstract: With the rapid growth in demand for AI-generated content (AIGC), edge AIGC
service providers (ASPs) have become indispensable. However, designing
incentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services
remains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In
this paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when
the teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions
(diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design
problem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and
contract derivation. To tackle the NP-hard setting-inference subproblem with
unknown variable sizes, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-empowered
framework that iteratively refines a naive seed solver using the LLM's domain

address the contract derivation problem using convex optimization techniques

### [59] [Learned Adaptive Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03471)
*Suvam Kumar Das,Suprio Ray*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 文章提出一种新的自适应索引学习方法，结合查询负载预测技术，经评估在多数情况下性能优于现有自适应索引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统索引在查询负载频繁变化或数据持续更新时不适用，现有学习索引需提前构建和训练，动态场景下有挑战，且尚无适用于自适应索引的学习索引。

Method: 提出一种新的自适应索引学习方法，在查询提交时动态构建，利用学习模型索引数据，并采用查询负载预测技术。

Result: 将该方法与现有自适应索引针对不同查询负载进行评估，结果显示在多数情况下表现更好，查询性能提升1.2 - 5.6倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习自适应索引方法在多数情况下比现有自适应索引性能更优。

Abstract: Indexes can significantly improve search performance in relational databases.
However, if the query workload changes frequently or new data updates occur
continuously, it may not be worthwhile to build a conventional index upfront
for query processing. Adaptive indexing is a technique in which an index gets
built on the fly as a byproduct of query processing. In recent years, research
in database indexing has taken a new direction where machine learning models
are employed for the purpose of indexing. These indexes, known as learned
indexes, can be more efficient compared to traditional indexes such as B+-tree
in terms of memory footprints and query performance. However, a learned index
has to be constructed upfront and requires training the model in advance, which
becomes a challenge in dynamic situations when workload changes frequently. To
the best of our knowledge, no learned indexes exist yet for adaptive indexing.
We propose a novel learned approach for adaptive indexing. It is built on the
fly as queries are submitted and utilizes learned models for indexing data. To
enhance query performance, we employ a query workload prediction technique that
makes future workload projection based on past workload data. We have evaluated
our learned adaptive indexing approach against existing adaptive indexes for
various query workloads. Our results show that our approach performs better
than others in most cases, offering 1.2x - 5.6x improvement in query
performance.

*Junfeng Liu,Haoxuan Xie,Siqiang Luo*

TL;DR: 本文提出ElasticLSM和Arce，实现ArceKV键值存储，在不同工作负载下表现优于现有策略，动态场景性能快约3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LSM树在动态工作负载下难以维持最优性能或转换开销大，需优化。

Method: 提出ElasticLSM去除传统LSM树结构约束，设计轻量级Arce引擎引导决策，基于RocksDB实现ArceKV。

Result: ArceKV在不同工作负载下优于现有压实策略，动态场景性能快约3倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在动态工作负载下实现持续性能优化。

Abstract: Key-value stores underpin a wide range of applications due to their
simplicity and efficiency. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM-trees) dominate as
their underlying structure, excelling at handling rapidly growing data. Recent
research has focused on optimizing LSM-tree performance under static workloads
with fixed read-write ratios. However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic,
and existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal
performance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns
shift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional
LSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions
(i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for
continuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight
compaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal
action from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we
implement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ArceKV outperforms state-of-the-art compaction
strategies across diverse workloads, delivering around 3x faster performance in
dynamic scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务对抗网络中分布式算法受攻击节点或链路影响，导致未知参数准确估计受阻的问题。

Method: 引入基于声誉的节点选择策略，采用加权支持向量数据描述（W - SVDD）模型训练内存数据，引入事件触发机制减少无效更新并推导合适阈值，分析算法收敛性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与其他算法相比，该算法以更低的通信成本实现了更优的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的低通信弹性分布式估计算法有效，能在多任务对抗网络中实现高效准确的估计。

Abstract: In multi-task adversarial networks, the accurate estimation of unknown
parameters in a distributed algorithm is hindered by attacked nodes or links.
To tackle this challenge, this brief proposes a low-communication resilient
distributed estimation algorithm. First, a node selection strategy based on
reputation is introduced that allows nodes to communicate with more reliable
subset of neighbors. Subsequently, to discern trustworthy intermediate
estimates, the Weighted Support Vector Data Description (W-SVDD) model is
employed to train the memory data. This trained model contributes to reinforce
the resilience of the distributed estimation process against the impact of
attacked nodes or links. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is
introduced to minimize ineffective updates to the W-SVDD model, and a suitable
threshold is derived based on assumptions. The convergence of the algorithm is
analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
achieves superior performance with less communication cost compared to other
algorithms.

interoperability of static nodes' information and runtime data exchanges.
Finally, we discuss the results from the piloting activities in the use cases
and the lessons learned.

Motivation: 在代理工作流中，AI代理可能出现错误且决策会传播错误，现有来源技术无法捕获和关联以代理为中心的元数据，因此需要细粒度来源信息。

Method: 引入扩展W3C PROV并利用模型上下文协议（MCP）的PROV - AGENT来源模型。

Result: 提出适合代理工作流的来源模型，开发近实时、开源的系统来捕获代理来源，进行跨设施评估，支持关键来源查询和代理可靠性分析。

Conclusion: PROV - AGENT模型可有效将代理交互集成到端到端工作流来源中，有助于解决代理工作流中的透明度、可追溯性等问题。

Abstract: Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly
used as core components of AI agents in complex, large-scale workflows across
federated and heterogeneous environments. In agentic workflows, autonomous
agents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and shape scientific
outcomes. This makes transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and
reliability essential. However, AI-based agents can hallucinate or reason
incorrectly, and their decisions may propagate errors through the workflow,
especially when one agent's output feeds into another's input. Therefore,
fine-grained provenance is essential to link agent decisions, their end-to-end
context, and downstream impacts. While provenance techniques have long
supported reproducibility and workflow data understanding, they fail to capture
and relate agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, and decisions) with the
rest of the workflow. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance
model that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to
integrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our
contributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows,
(2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and
(3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments,
demonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability
analysis.

Motivation: 现有的使用认知逻辑分析分布式算法的“全信息协议”在空间和计算时间上可能效率低下，需要研究更实用的信息交换方式。

Method: 先澄清同步拜占庭协议问题规范和基于知识的程序相关问题，然后在给定故障模型和满足特定条件的信息交换协议下实现该程序。

Result: 基于知识的程序在特定条件下能产生相对于使用相同信息交换的解决方案最优的协议，但该最优性并非普遍成立。

Conclusion: 对于同步拜占庭协议问题，在较弱但更实用的信息交换方式下进行认知分析有其价值，但实现最优方案需满足特定条件。

Abstract: In order to develop solutions that perform actions as early as possible,
analysis of distributed algorithms using epistemic logic has generally
concentrated on ``full information protocols'', which may be inefficient with
respect to space and computation time. The paper reconsiders the epistemic
analysis of the problem of Simultaneous Byzantine Agreement with respect to
weaker, but more practical, exchanges of information. The paper first clarifies
some issues concerning both the specification of this problem and the knowledge
based program characterizing its solution, concerning the distinction between
the notions of ``nonfaulty'' and ``not yet failed'', on which there are
variances in the literature. It is then shown that, when implemented relative
to a given failure model and an information exchange protocol satisfying
certain conditions, this knowledge based program yields a protocol that is
optimal relative to solutions using the same information exchange. Conditions
are also identified under which this implementation is also an optimum, but an
example is provided that shows this does not hold in general.

Result: PiM基非二进制LDPC解码器解码吞吐量达76 Mbit/s，与边缘GPU实现方案相比有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的近内存非二进制LDPC解码器方案是有效的，在性能上有一定优势。

Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are an important feature of several
communication and storage applications, offering a flexible and effective
method for error correction. These codes are computationally complex and
require the exploitation of parallel processing to meet real-time constraints.
As advancements in arithmetic and logic unit technology allowed for higher
performance of computing systems, memory technology has not kept the same pace
of development, creating a data movement bottleneck and affecting parallel
processing systems more dramatically. To alleviate the severity of this
bottleneck, several solutions have been proposed, namely the processing
in-memory (PiM) paradigm that involves the design of compute units to where (or
near) the data is stored, utilizing thousands of low-complexity processing
units to perform out bit-wise and simple arithmetic operations. This paper
presents a novel efficient solution for near-memory non-binary LDPC decoders in
the UPMEM system, for the best of our knowledge the first real hardware
PiM-based non-binary LDPC decoder that is benchmarked against low-power GPU
parallel solutions highly optimized for throughput performance. PiM-based
non-binary LDPC decoders can achieve 76 Mbit/s of decoding throughput, which is
even competitive when compared against implementations running in edge GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流行模型服务系统依赖单体和启发式任务调度器，需要一个能实现低开销、可靠性和可扩展性的调度系统来优化大语言模型服务框架中的负载均衡和自动配置。

Method: Block作为完全分布式、无状态和预测性的调度系统，利用大语言模型推理的确定性和可预测特征（如主机配置、响应长度和硬件性能），基于准确预测的指标进行调度决策。

Result: 在12 GPU集群上的评估显示，Block显著优于启发式调度器，服务容量最多提升16.7%，P99尾延迟最多降低49.5%，且在不同模型、工作负载和配置下性能提升一致。

Conclusion: Block能有效优化大语言模型服务框架中的负载均衡和自动配置，具有良好的性能和通用性。

Abstract: This paper presents Block, a distributed scheduling framework designed to
optimize load balancing and auto-provisioning across instances in large
language model serving frameworks by leveraging contextual information from
incoming requests. Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic
and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed,
stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead,
reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable
characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response
lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on
accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block
significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up
to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance
gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.
Code and data are open-sourced.

Abstract: We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for
coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related
classes of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided
expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative
size at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$
fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$
with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This
result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)
developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative
size at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient
$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong
regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\epsilon)$-factor
approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\epsilon>0$.
  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$
matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove
that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem
is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the
other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the
corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.
  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph
spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The
number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\tau$ is at most $O(1/\tau^{2})$
times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\tau^{2}/2$. While this result
allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided
spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic
results.

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding large independent sets in
$3$-colorable graphs with small $1$-sided threshold rank. Specifically, given
an $n$-vertex $3$-colorable graph whose uniform random walk matrix has at most
$r$ eigenvalues larger than $\varepsilon$, our algorithm finds a proper
$3$-coloring on at least $(\frac{1}{2}-O(\varepsilon))n$ vertices in time
$n^{O(r/\varepsilon^2)}$. This extends and improves upon the result of Bafna,
Hsieh, and Kothari on $1$-sided expanders. Furthermore, an independent work by
Buhai, Hua, Steurer, and V\'ari-Kakas shows that it is UG-hard to properly
$3$-color more than $(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)n$ vertices, thus establishing
the tightness of our result.
  Our proof is short and simple, relying on the observation that for any
distribution over proper $3$-colorings, the correlation across an edge must be
large if the marginals of the endpoints are not concentrated on any single
color. Notably, this property fails for $4$-colorings, which is consistent with
the hardness result of [BHK25] for $4$-colorable $1$-sided expanders.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The reduction of the fragment assembly problem to (variations of) the
classical Eulerian trail problem [Pevzner et al., PNAS 2001] has led to
remarkable progress in genome assembly. This reduction employs the notion of de
Bruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$. A single
Eulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini
et al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX
2020] based on $z$-anonymity.
  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a
de Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function
maps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in
the reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the
latter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an
interval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the
following basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we
efficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et
al.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.
  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain
knowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the
problem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$
and $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks
[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,
highlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give
combinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the
state-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an
algorithm parametrized by $w (\log w+1) /(k-1)$. Our improved algorithm shows
that it is enough when the range of positions is small relative to $k$.

Conclusion: 对于在线公平分配问题，可通过非自适应对手和侧信息（如最大项值预测）来实现PROP1近似，但更强公平概念近似困难。

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Conclusion: 此工作是Foundation - Expert范式在该规模的首次成功部署，为实现推荐系统的扩展定律提供有效蓝图。

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

Motivation: 现有向量搜索库针对x86 CPU架构优化，而华为鲲鹏CPU基于ARM架构且计算能力有竞争力，需要适配的向量搜索库。

Method: KBest采用硬件感知和算法优化，包括SIMD加速距离计算、数据预取、索引细化、提前终止和向量量化。

Conclusion: KBest是适合鲲鹏920 CPU的高效向量搜索库，具有良好性能和应用价值。

Abstract: Vector search, which returns the vectors most similar to a given query vector
from a large vector dataset, underlies many important applications such as
search, recommendation, and LLMs. To be economic, vector search needs to be
efficient to reduce the resources required by a given query workload. However,
existing vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss and DiskANN) are optimized for
x86 CPU architectures (i.e., Intel and AMD CPUs) while Huawei Kunpeng CPUs are
based on the ARM architecture and competitive in compute power. In this paper,
we present KBest as a vector search library tailored for the latest Kunpeng 920
CPUs. To be efficient, KBest incorporates extensive hardware-aware and
algorithmic optimizations, which include single-instruction-multiple-data
(SIMD) accelerated distance computation, data prefetch, index refinement, early
termination, and vector quantization. Experiment results show that KBest
outperforms SOTA vector search libraries running on x86 CPUs, and our
optimizations can improve the query throughput by over 2x. Currently, KBest
serves applications from both our internal business and external enterprise
clients with tens of millions of queries on a daily basis.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在自动视觉检测任务中表现不如人类专家，存在预训练时异常检测知识集成不足和异常推理语言生成不精确等问题。

Method: 提出ADSeeker，构建SEEK - M&V知识库，引入Q2K RAG框架，利用Hierarchical Sparse Prompt机制和类型级特征，引入MulA数据集。

Result: ADSeeker在多个基准数据集上实现了零样本检测的最优性能。

Conclusion: ADSeeker这一即插即用框架能有效提升自动视觉检测的性能。

Abstract: Automatic vision inspection holds significant importance in industry
inspection. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong
language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their
performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this
context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of
anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of
technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning.
To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant
designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded
reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base,
SEEK-MVTec&VisA (SEEK-M&V), which we construct to address the limitations of
existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&V includes
semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more
comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this
knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot
anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt
mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns.
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection
(IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly
(MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories.
Extensive experiments show that our plug-and-play framework, ADSeeker, achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 用户交互序列变长以及用户兴趣和意图复杂纠缠给顺序推荐的多样性带来挑战。

Method: 提出模型无关的Dual - disentangle框架DDSRec，在交互建模和表示学习中采用解纠缠视角优化用户兴趣和意图建模。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，DDSRec在顺序推荐的准确性和多样性方面有效且优越。

Conclusion: DDSRec能有效平衡顺序推荐中的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts user preferences over time and has
achieved remarkable success. However, the growing length of user interaction
sequences and the complex entanglement of evolving user interests and
intentions introduce significant challenges to diversity. To address these, we
propose a model-agnostic Dual-disentangle framework for Diversified Sequential
Recommendation (DDSRec). The framework refines user interest and intention
modeling by adopting disentangling perspectives in interaction modeling and
representation learning, thereby balancing accuracy and diversity in sequential
recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of DDSRec in terms of accuracy and diversity
for sequential recommendations.

TL;DR: 降低模型参数和计算的数值精度可提高检索系统效率，但会出现虚假平局问题，本文提出新评估协议解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度计算相关性分数时会出现虚假平局，导致结果变异性高，评估不可靠。

Method: 提出更稳健的检索评估协议，包括高精度评分（HPS）和考虑平局的检索指标（TRM）。

Result: 实验表明HPS显著降低平局导致的不稳定性，TRM准确恢复预期指标值。

Conclusion: 该组合能为低精度检索提供更一致、可靠的评估系统。

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Method: 提出由单个协作分支CoBraR组成的推荐系统，利用用户和物品神经网络模块间的权重共享获取共享嵌入空间中的潜在表征。

Result: 在电商和电影推荐的定量实验中，CoBraR减少了参数数量，提升了非准确性方面且未影响准确性。

Conclusion: CoBraR有应用和扩展到现实场景的潜力。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

Result: 在四个多领域查询数据集和两个多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，MultiRAG显著提升了复杂多源场景下知识检索的可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: MultiRAG能有效缓解多源检索增强生成中的幻觉问题，提升知识检索性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

<details>

Motivation: 单向量搜索有压缩信息导致性能下降问题，多向量方法虽有优势但因缺乏工具导致实际应用少，为解决此差距。

Method: 基于Sentence Transformers构建PyLate库，支持多向量架构，具备多向量特定功能，对已有代码模板改动小。

Result: PyLate已助力开发出GTE - ModernColBERT和Reason - ModernColBERT等先进模型。

Conclusion: PyLate能加速后期交互模型的研究和实际应用，挖掘其在现代信息检索系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

Conclusion: 为可解释AI领域提供框架，通过“假设分析”场景理解顺序推荐决策，增强用户信任和系统透明度。

Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have demonstrated remarkable
effectiveness in capturing users' evolving preferences. However, their inherent
complexity as "black box" models poses significant challenges for
explainability. This work presents the first counterfactual explanation
technique specifically developed for SRSs, introducing a novel approach in this
space, addressing the key question: What minimal changes in a user's
interaction history would lead to different recommendations? To achieve this,
we introduce a specialized genetic algorithm tailored for discrete sequences
and show that generating counterfactual explanations for sequential data is an
NP-Complete problem. We evaluate these approaches across four experimental
settings, varying between targeted-untargeted and categorized-uncategorized
scenarios, to comprehensively assess their capability in generating meaningful
explanations. Using three different datasets and three models, we are able to
demonstrate that our methods successfully generate interpretable counterfactual
explanation while maintaining model fidelity close to one. Our findings
contribute to the growing field of Explainable AI by providing a framework for
understanding sequential recommendation decisions through the lens of "what-if"
scenarios, ultimately enhancing user trust and system transparency.

Method: 引入两步LLM蒸馏过程，从LLM教师模型通过交叉编码器辅助模型向双编码器学生模型蒸馏，采用多任务训练方法。

Result: 在多任务训练设置中集成来自LLM的知识蒸馏过程，提升了双编码器在eBay检索相关广告关键词的性能。

Conclusion: 采用LLM蒸馏过程能有效提升双编码器在检索相关广告关键词方面的性能。

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Abstract: Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast
catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper
presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin
America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the
selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our
approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three
feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

Conclusion: 提出的BH - PEFT方法和动态微调方法支持现实场景中的不确定感知和自适应决策，对商业分析和数据科学有贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Conclusion: ZetA是Adam的高效且鲁棒的替代方案，在噪声或高粒度分类任务中特别有效。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: 所提方法是一种快速且内存高效的逆求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Motivation: 探索先进深度学习方法预测2025年NCAA赛事结果。

Method: 利用历史数据，实现LSTM和Transformer模型，进行特征工程，用BCE和Brier损失函数训练模型。

Result: Transformer用BCE优化有更好判别力，LSTM用Brier损失函数有更好概率校准。

Conclusion: 强调根据预测任务需求选择合适模型架构和损失函数，提供可复现分析框架。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics
and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU两种时空模型，结合卷积循环网络与最小可并行RNN优势，在时空预测任务上表现优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ConvRNN模型在教师强制训练时顺序更新隐藏状态的瓶颈问题，提高时空模型训练效率。

Method: 将MinLSTM和MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式扩展到卷积架构，在MinConvLSTM中引入受xLSTM启发的指数门控机制。

Result: 在两个时空预测任务中，训练速度显著超越标准ConvLSTMs和ConvGRUs，预测误差更低。

Conclusion: 最小循环结构与卷积输入聚合结合，为时空序列建模提供高效替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Motivation: FeFET固有的随机性给准确可靠建模带来挑战，现有模型难以捕捉变异性或缺乏数学平滑性，需要新的建模方法。

Method: 基于混合密度网络（MDN），集成C-infinity连续激活函数和特定于器件的嵌入层，从学习的嵌入分布中采样生成合成器件实例。

Result: 模型的R2为0.92，能高精度捕捉FeFET电流行为的变异性。

Conclusion: 该框架是可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，为FeFET全随机行为建模提供基础，利于未来紧凑模型开发和电路仿真集成。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB
control.

Conclusion: 所提混合神经符号架构在处理含不对称结构噪声的回归问题上表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape

sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an

238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,

models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

Motivation: 现有多项逻辑带臂老虎机算法缺乏有限适应性，为应对现实挑战和实用性需求，需开发仅允许 M 次策略更新的算法。

Method: 提出 B - MNL - CB 和 RS - MNL 两种算法，分别适用于批量和少切换范式。

Result: B - MNL - CB 在随机生成上下文且有 Ω(log log T) 次更新轮数时实现 Õ(√T) 遗憾；RS - MNL 在对抗生成上下文下用 Õ(log T) 次策略更新实现 Õ(√T) 遗憾。实验表明算法比现有基线更具竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提算法在有限策略更新下表现良好，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Result: 在多个基准测试中证明了SmallKV的有效性，效率评估显示其吞吐量比基线方法高1.75 - 2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境中进行大语言模型推理有高效且高性能的潜力。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for

we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Result: 在十三个真实世界基准测试中，DMSC保持了最先进性能和卓越计算效率。

Conclusion: DMSC框架能有效解决现有时间序列预测方法的问题，可用于TSF任务。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Result: 在不同遗忘场景、数据集和模型上的大量实验证明了该方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 所提基于CP的MU方法能有效解决现有方法的局限，可用于移除目标数据。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN

TL;DR: 提出Context - Adaptive Multi - Prompt Embedding方法丰富视觉语言对比学习语义表示，结合正则化损失，在检索基准上有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的标准CLIP风格模型依赖单一文本嵌入，语义表示不够丰富，需要改进。

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示含自适应标记，一次前向传播处理所有提示，将提示嵌入组合成统一文本表示，加入多样性正则化损失和否定感知损失。

Result: 在图像 - 文本和视频 - 文本检索基准上均取得持续改进。

Conclusion: 所提出的Context - Adaptive Multi - Prompt Embedding方法能有效丰富视觉语言对比学习中的语义表示。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 散度对信号处理算法至关重要，现有alpha - beta散度用于非负数据，需扩展到复数数据。

Method: 重新设计alpha - beta散度定义以适应复数向量参数，设置不同超参数得到不同结果。

Result: 新公式在超参数为1时化为欧氏和马氏平方距离，优化alpha - beta平均失真得到的质心有闭式表达式。

Conclusion: 该扩展在复数数据的信号处理领域有广泛潜在适用性。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 验证FS算法在高维数据集上的性能，通过与随机选特征对比。

Method: 检验使用随机选择特征的零假设，与FS算法选择的特征进行对比。

Result: 在高维数据集（特别是基因表达）分类任务中，小的随机特征子集训练的模型表现与全特征训练的模型相当；典型大小的随机子集表现优于已发表研究中选的top - k特征。

Conclusion: 挑战了高维数据集上的许多特征选择结果，对基于计算选基因的药物设计或靶向干预研究提出严重质疑。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

Method: 引入端到端的大型人工智能模型SolarSeer，直接将历史卫星观测数据映射到未来预测，消除数据同化和求解偏微分方程的计算开销。

Result: SolarSeer运行速度比传统NWP快1500多倍，能在3秒内完成美国本土5公里分辨率的24小时云量和太阳辐照度预测；相比HRRR，在再分析数据中太阳辐照度预测的均方根误差降低27.28%，在1800个站点中降低15.35%，还能有效捕捉太阳辐照度波动。

Conclusion: SolarSeer的超快、准确的24小时太阳能辐照度预测为向可持续、净零能源系统转型提供有力支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

Method: 提出新属性区分对抗性和干净文本，利用该属性过滤对抗性文本。

Result: 使用基准数据集评估，方法有效，性能接近原始 RAG 系统。

Conclusion: 提出的 FilterRAG 和 ML - FilterRAG 方法可有效缓解 PoisonedRAG 攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Result: 结构方程模型方法评估更准确，学习的策略方差更低，在大偏移时优势明显，且在模型指定良好时可学习最优策略。

Conclusion: 所提结构方程模型方法在分布鲁棒评估和学习上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

Result: 去除重要性采样的简化版本性能与标准GRPO相当，TIC GRPO能无偏估计当前策略梯度。

Conclusion: TIC GRPO算法有效，同时给出GRPO风格方法的理论收敛分析。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Result: 通过大量基准测试和实时控制实验验证了SkyGP的有效性，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SkyGP能在解决计算和内存约束的同时，继承精确高斯过程的学习性能保证。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的资源高效框架在自动化漏洞评估方面有效，能在减少模型资源需求的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Method: 研究四种基于不同KAN实现的KAN - AE变体，在田纳西 - 伊斯曼过程上与正交自编码器（OAE）进行基准测试，用故障检测率（FDR）评估。

Result: WavKAN - AE总体FDR最高；EfficientKAN - AE在低数据下FDR达90%以上；FastKAN - AE在大数据量有竞争力；FourierKAN - AE表现不佳；OAE需更多数据才能达到KAN - AE性能。

Conclusion: KAN - AE能结合数据效率和强故障检测性能，有提高模型透明度潜力，适合数据受限工业场景。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Conclusion: CauKer可用于样本高效的预训练，生成的数据集有良好的缩放特性。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Conclusion: 指出研究存在局限性，提出未来可能的研究方向。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前标准评估制度依赖静态基准测试，无法适应生成式机器学习模型应用中响应的多元性和上下文依赖性，不能满足动态用户需求和不断变化的现实。

Method: GrandJury引入结合时间衰减聚合、完全可追溯性、动态透明任务评分标准归因和多评估者人工判断的正式评估协议。

Result: 提供开源实现（grandjury PyPI包）和大型语言模型推理输出的公共集合。

Conclusion: GrandJury为评估无绝对真值的机器学习输出提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

Motivation: 现有强化学习在大语言模型应用多聚焦单轮问题，与现实中如软件工程等需丰富多轮交互的场景有差距，需拓展到一般场景。

Method: 使用改进的解耦优势策略优化（DAPO）算法，基于Qwen2.5 - 72B - Instruct训练智能体。

Result: 在SWE - bench Verified基准上，智能体成功率从20%提升到39%；在SWE - rebench上，匹配或超越DeepSeek - V3 - 0324和Qwen3 - 235B - A22B等模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建更强大的复杂现实问题自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

Result: PLoRA在给定超参搜索空间下，LoRA微调的完成时间最多减少7.52倍，训练吞吐量最多提高12.8倍。

Conclusion: PLoRA能有效提高LoRA微调的训练效率。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 算法在总变差散度和Kullback - Leibler散度度量的不确定性集合上实现低遗憾，并能有效找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: 为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统建立了新的实用路径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel perspective on varied-density clustering for
high-dimensional data by framing it as a label propagation process in
neighborhood graphs that adapt to local density variations. Our method formally
connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of
efficient graph propagation techniques developed in network science. To ensure
scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to
existing baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态现实场景中的高效分散式学习提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable

Motivation: 现有MPQ方法在比特宽度选择时假设量化参数值反映对精度提升的贡献，但实际不一定，故研究此问题。

Method: 提出基于Shapley的MPQ方法（SMPQ）测量比特宽度操作对MPQ任务的直接贡献，用蒙特卡罗采样近似计算Shapley值。

Result: 在主流基准测试上，SMPQ始终优于基于梯度的竞争对手。

Conclusion: SMPQ能有效解决MPQ中比特宽度选择问题，达到先进性能。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Conclusion: 所提单阶段方法在城市分析中效果良好，特别是扩散建模模块有效。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

Conclusion: 强调了价值模型在RLHF中的重要性，并提供了在噪声现实环境中进行稳健策略优化的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Result: 广泛实验证实了HiTeC的有效性。

Conclusion: HiTeC框架通过两阶段设计在不降低表示质量的情况下提高了可扩展性，能有效进行TAHGs的自监督学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Method: 引入新的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架分析三种调度策略。

Conclusion: 研究为现代深度学习设计高效稳定训练程序提供统一理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的GED近似方法大多假设单位成本编辑操作，在实际应用中不现实，需要更好的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法学到的成本函数有助于理解复杂图结构，在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域有价值。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Motivation: RegMean合并各线性层时独立进行，忽略层间特征和信息传播对最终预测的影响，需要改进。

Method: 在RegMean目标中明确纳入合并模型层间的层内和跨层依赖，提出RegMean++。

Result: RegMean++在多种设置下始终优于RegMean，与其他先进模型合并方法相比达到有竞争力或最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，能更好捕捉合并模型行为。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究发布gpt - oss的最坏情况前沿风险。

Method: 引入恶意微调（MFT），在生物学和网络安全两个领域微调gpt - oss，通过特定环境训练以最大化风险，并与其他模型对比评估前沿风险。

Result: 与前沿闭源权重模型相比，MFT gpt - oss表现不如OpenAI o3；与开源权重模型相比，gpt - oss可能略微提升生物能力，但未大幅推进前沿。

Conclusion: 这些结果影响了模型发布决策，且MFT方法可为评估未来开源权重模型发布的危害提供指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Method: 提出两阶段聚类的机器学习方法，先基于最小位置特征分组，再加入其他特征，用线性回归或广义相加模型建模。

Result: 在德国43309条房产数据上，GAM的平均绝对误差改善36%，LR改善58%，图形分析揭示了簇间模式转变。

Conclusion: 强调特定簇见解的重要性，能提升可解释性，为相关人员提供可靠房产估值。

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

Conclusion: MPS - SSM框架有效解决了现有SSMs的理论问题，具有良好性能和鲁棒性，预测充分性原则有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的框架有潜力提高可解释性并支持早期药物安全评估。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

Motivation: 以往研究在用户无模型推理信息情况下得出可调整模型预测能减少算法厌恶的结果，不清楚可解释性模型能否进一步减少厌恶或使可调整性变得多余，故开展研究。

Method: 概念性复制一项知名研究，引入可直观展示决策逻辑的可解释性机器学习模型，进行有280名参与者的预注册用户研究。

Result: 复制了可调整性效果，即允许用户修改算法预测可减轻厌恶；可解释性影响小于预期，在样本中不显著；可解释性和可调整性的影响比预期更独立。

Conclusion: 可调整性对减轻算法厌恶有作用，可解释性作用有限，二者相对独立。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax搭配交叉熵损失存在目标分数不可达、训练易过拟合和时间浪费等问题。

Method: 设计合理且匹配测试的变换得到AS - Softmax，训练时丢弃低分类别，开发基于掩码样本比例的自适应梯度累积策略。

Result: AS - Softmax在多任务中始终优于softmax及其变体，损失与验证分类性能显著相关，自适应梯度累积策略能提速1.2倍且保持分类效果。

Conclusion: AS - Softmax能有效解决传统softmax问题，且自适应梯度累积策略可加速训练。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

Result: 工业数据集评估显示HALO在处理多尺度约束上表现优越。

Conclusion: HALO能在预算/ROI要求与训练场景差异大时稳健适应，减少约束违规并提高GMV。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Method: 使用三种分解方法将HKG转换为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型性能；提出FormerGNN框架，利用限定符集成器、基于GNN的图编码器和改进的信息集成方法。

Result: 部分KGE模型性能与HKGE模型相当；当前HKGE模型存在拓扑改变、信息保存不全、捕捉长程依赖不足和信息压缩问题；FormerGNN框架优于现有HKGE模型。

Conclusion: FormerGNN框架能解决当前HKGE模型的问题，为未来HKGE研究提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Motivation: 研究在委托 - 代理框架下，委托人如何在考虑代理人激励的情况下选择p值阈值以平衡假阳性和假阴性错误。

Method: 构建博弈论模型，分析代理人参与和报告行为对委托人统计决策规则的反应；使用公开药物审批数据进行实证验证。

Result: 发现委托人的错误在可有效计算的临界p值阈值分段下呈现明显的单调行为，得到最优p值阈值的可解释特征。

Conclusion: 为假设检验框架内的战略互动提供了全面视角，提供了技术和监管方面的见解。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确实时预测相位分辨海洋波场问题待解，现有深度学习方法需大量真实标记数据，现实中难以获取。

Method: 提出PINO框架，将海洋重力波自由表面边界条件残差嵌入损失函数，软约束解空间。

Conclusion: PINO能实现准确实时重建，在多种波况下泛化性强，为现实海洋环境数据驱动的波浪重建和预测奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Motivation: 前人研究发现计算机视觉和自然语言处理偏差缓解存在拉平效应，不清楚其是否适用于表格数据任务，且零和权衡认知或阻碍公平政策推广。

Method: 对8种表格数据偏差缓解方法，在44个任务中用5个真实数据集和4个常见机器学习模型进行评估，并探索仅对弱势群体应用最先进偏差缓解方法。

Result: 这些方法呈零和效应，改进弱势群体利益会减少优势群体利益；仅对弱势群体应用方法有望提升其利益且不影响优势群体和整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究指出无零和权衡实现公平性提升的潜在途径，有助于推动偏差缓解方法的采用。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型很多层信息贡献少却占内存和能耗，需解决极低比特压缩时维持精度的问题。

Method: 引入三个互补的逐层诊断指标，实现无梯度更新的自动位宽分配。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 4B上2.05比特量化恢复95.9%的FP16基线性能，在多个任务上优于GPTQ和AWQ；在LLaMA3.2 - 3B上2.07比特精度维持98.2%基线精度并实现4倍内存缩减。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限边缘设备部署小语言模型建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: 融合可穿戴传感器、环境智能和先进AI模型，利用UniTS通用时间序列模型学习患者模式，采用异常检测提供实时个性化警报，集成LLM增强可解释性。

Result: 该方法优于12种SOTA异常检测方法，F1分数提高约22%，在真实场景@HOME成功部署。

Conclusion: 无需临床级设备，使用非侵入式轻量级设备也能实现高质量健康监测，集成LLM可将异常分数转化为临床见解。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

Method: 构建基于代理框架的分层工具，定义不同代理职责，使用大语言模型进行多轮研究循环，对比不同配置下的结果。

Result: 多代理设置在聚焦结合优化方面表现出色，平均预测结合亲和力提高31%；单代理运行生成的分子具有更好的类药性质，但结合分数较弱；无引导的大语言模型运行最快，但推理路径有效性未经验证。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展、聚焦反馈循环和来源信息可将通用大语言模型转化为可审计的分子设计系统，扩展工具集可推动研究工作流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统云环境机器学习工作负载资源分配方法存在SLA违规或资源浪费问题，需要一种能平衡训练时间、成本和满足SLA约束的资源分配方法。

Method: 提出SLA - MORL框架，有智能初始化和动态权重调整两个创新点，构建21维状态表示，通过演员 - 评论家网络决策。

Result: 在13种不同ML工作负载上评估，SLA - MORL使关键期限任务训练时间减少67.2%，预算受限工作负载成本降低68.8%，整体SLA合规性提高73.4%。

Conclusion: SLA - MORL为云资源管理提供了实用解决方案，能在现代ML训练环境中平衡性能、成本和可靠性。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: 提出新的Kronecker适配器MoKA，解决低秩适配器表达能力有限问题，实验表明其优于基线且减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩家族适配器因秩约束表达能力有限，限制复杂任务性能，需提出新方法解决。

Method: 提出Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA)，将权重更新建模为Kronecker积的混合，利用门控机制衡量因子重要性，改革Kronecker计算以适配硬件。

Result: 在指令调优和常识推理任务上，MoKA优于PEFT基线，最多减少27倍可训练参数。

Conclusion: MoKA实现了性能和参数效率之间的最优权衡，达到了当前最优水平。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM大多缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，CoT - PRM数据标注成本高。

Method: 提出VRPRM和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 使用少量数据，VRPRM超越总数据量400K的非思考PRM，在BoN实验中相对基础模型性能提升达118%。

Conclusion: 所提组合训练策略能以较低数据标注成本实现更高质量推理能力，为PRM训练提供新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: 提出基于低秩适配（LoRAs）的Horus框架应对联邦学习中毒攻击，实验显示其在鲁棒性和准确性上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在现实超异构环境下易受中毒攻击，异构性破坏聚合策略效果且使攻击难检测，高维模型扩大攻击面。

Method: 在经验稳定层插入LoRAs，仅聚合LoRAs以减少攻击面；利用LoRA - A设计异质性无关中毒分数过滤中毒客户端；为良性客户端设计投影感知聚合机制。

Result: 在不同数据集、模型架构和攻击下的大量实验表明，Horus在鲁棒性和准确性上始终优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Horus框架能有效解决联邦学习在超异构环境下的中毒攻击问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Result: 在12个不同的解释任务中，DeepFaith在10个指标上的整体忠实度高于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: DeepFaith是有效且具有跨领域泛化性的统一解释框架。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

Result: 该技术在多个数据集上持续提升包括重参数化、Gumbel - Softmax和REINFORCE等基准方法的性能。

Conclusion: 为生成模型训练开辟了结合解析计算稳定性与深度非线性架构表达性的新方向。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在作物产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳，主要源于数据不对称问题，为解决此问题开展研究。

Method: 引入VITA变分预训练框架，预训练时用详细天气变量作代理目标，通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态，部署时仅用基本天气统计数据微调。

Result: 应用于美国763个县，VITA在所有评估场景下预测玉米和大豆产量达最优，极端天气年份优势明显，相比GNN - RNN用更少数据表现更优。

Conclusion: 领域感知的AI设计可克服数据限制，支持气候变化下的农业预测。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Conclusion: Goedel - Prover - V2在开源定理证明器中总体性能最强，在受限计算预算下排名靠前。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

Conclusion: 提出的用患者特定权重微调预训练模型的方法能有效提高局灶性癫痫患者癫痫发作区识别的诊断性能。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Conclusion: 讨论了表征可迁移性对模型蒸馏、模块化学习和鲁棒学习系统设计的影响。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Method: 分析多种有多个标注的分类数据集及拟合的模拟分布，确定固定预算下的最优(N, K)配置。

Result: 考虑人类分歧时，多数数据集在至少一个指标上N×K不超1000且K>10；K和N的权衡与评估指标有关。

Conclusion: 方法可帮助机器学习从业者在预算内获取更有效的测试数据。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Result: 揭示大语言模型作为语义解析器和概率黑盒组件的双重视图，合约满足是概率性的，语义验证通过程序员指定条件定义。

Conclusion: 任何满足相同合约的两个代理在这些合约方面是功能等效的。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency,
poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior
efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may
offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper
introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture
whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual
cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical
processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation,
and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized
benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image
classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification
accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset,
surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that
integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more
efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing
long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) system that
integrates optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) and simultaneous
transmitting and reflecting Intelligent reflecting surfaces (STAR-IRS) to
address critical challenges in next-generation communication networks. The
proposed system model features a signal transmitted from the optical ground
station (OGS) to the earth station (ES) via an OIRS mounted horizontally on a
high altitude platform (HAP). The ES uses an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay
with fixed gain for signal relaying, which is then transmitted through a
STAR-IRS vertically installed on a building to facilitate communication with
both indoor and outdoor users. The FSO link incorporates (multiple-input
multiple-output) MIMO technology, and this paper develops a channel model
specifically designed for scenarios where the number of OIRS units exceeds one.
For the radio-frequency (RF) link, a novel and highly precise approximation
method is introduced, offering superior accuracy compared to traditional
approaches based on the central limit theorem (CLT). Closed-form analytical
expressions for key performance metrics, including outage probability (OP),
ergodic capacity and average bit error rate (BER) are derived in terms of the
bivariate Fox-H function for this novel five hops system. Asymptotic
expressions at high SNR are also presented, providing insights into system
diversity order.

Conclusion: 该工作可实现自主代理在严格程序逻辑应用中的可验证和可靠部署。

Abstract: While powerful, the inherent non-determinism of large language model (LLM)
agents limits their application in structured operational environments where
procedural fidelity and predictable execution are strict requirements. This
limitation stems from current architectures that conflate probabilistic,
high-level planning with low-level action execution within a single generative
process. To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new
paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework
decouples the workflow logic from the generative model. An expert-defined
operational procedure is first codified into a source code-based Execution
Blueprint, which is then executed by a deterministic engine. The LLM is
strategically invoked as a specialized tool to handle bounded, complex
sub-tasks within the workflow, but never to decide the workflow's path. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the challenging tau-bench benchmark,
designed for complex user-tool-rule scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the
Source Code Agent establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming the
strongest baseline by 10.1 percentage points on the average Pass^1 score while
dramatically improving execution efficiency. Our work enables the verifiable
and reliable deployment of autonomous agents in applications governed by strict
procedural logic.

Conclusion: 通过结合性能分析和程序语义的深度学习方法，可更好理解程序低效之处，实现可操作的优化。

Abstract: Profiling tools (also known as profilers) play an important role in
understanding program performance at runtime, such as hotspots, bottlenecks,
and inefficiencies. While profilers have been proven to be useful, they give
extra burden to software engineers. Software engineers, as the users, are
responsible to interpret the complex performance data and identify actionable
optimization in program source code. However, it can be challenging for users
to associate inefficiencies with the program semantics, especially if the users
are not the authors of the code, which limits the applicability of profilers.
  In this thesis, we explore a new direction to combine performance profiles
and program semantics with a deep learning approach. The key idea is to glean
code summary for semantic information (at a certain level) and integrate it
into a profiler, which can better understand program inefficiencies for
actionable optimization. To be concrete, we combine profiles generated by Async
Profiler (the state-of-the-art Java profiler) with code summarization from a
fine-tuned CodeBERT-based model. We demonstrate the code summaries of any
selected call path in a graphic user interface. Our system can effectively
assist analysis on many Java benchmarks.

Abstract: Maintaining code quality in large-scale software systems presents significant
challenges, particularly in settings where a large numbers of engineers work
concurrently on a codebase. This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS)
system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide
actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3
models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common
code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good
``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user
experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect
responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able
to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This
system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting
and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate,
demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we
present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating
developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Proof-oriented programming languages (POPLs) empower developers to write code
alongside formal correctness proofs, providing formal guarantees that the code
adheres to specified requirements. Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs
present a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader
software community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development

advancement of effective proof engineering and the development of
proof-synthesis models/tools.
  In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis
of fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two
languages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about
how experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof

informal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are
predictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design
guidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting,
explicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined
verifier interaction. We also present a case study of an F* proof agent
grounded in these recommendations, and demonstrate improved performance over

*David Svoboda,Lori Flynn,William Klieber,Michael Duggan,Nicholas Reimer,Joseph Sible*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个自动程序修复（APR）工具应用于C/C++代码修复的工程经验，该工具能显著减少静态分析（SA）警报，还促使CERT编码标准维护者重新评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态分析工具产生大量警报，其中很多是误报，识别真阳性警报和修复代码缺陷工作量大，希望借助自动程序修复工具减少人力。

Method: 设计、开发和性能测试一个针对多种静态分析工具产生的3类警报修复C/C++代码的APR工具。

Result: 在一个代码库上，该工具修复了9234个警报中的8718个；对于2类缺陷、2个SA工具和2个代码库，平均修复或排除超80%的警报，且测试显示修复未明显降低代码性能或引发新警报（sqlite3.c可能除外）。

Conclusion: 该APR工具能显著减少SA警报和人工审查工作量，其应用促使CERT编码标准维护者重新评估指标，同时文章还有新的SA数据分析等独特贡献。

Abstract: (Note: This work is a preprint.) Static analysis (SA) tools produce many
diagnostic alerts indicating that source code in C or C++ may be defective and
potentially vulnerable to security exploits. Many of these alerts are false
positives. Identifying the true-positive alerts and repairing the defects in
the associated code are huge efforts that automated program repair (APR) tools
can help with. Our experience showed us that APR can reduce the number of SA
alerts significantly and reduce the manual effort of analysts to review code.
This engineering experience paper details the application of design,
development, and performance testing to an APR tool we built that repairs C/C++
code associated with 3 categories of alerts produced by multiple SA tools. Its
repairs are simple and local. Furthermore, our findings convinced the
maintainers of the CERT Coding Standards to re-assess and update the metrics
used to assess when violations of guidelines are detectable or repairable. We
discuss engineering design choices made to support goals of trustworthiness and
acceptability to developers. Our APR tool repaired 8718 out of 9234 alerts
produced by one SA tool on one codebase. It can repair 3 flaw categories. For 2
flaw categories, 2 SA tools, and 2 codebases, our tool repaired or dismissed as
false positives over 80% of alerts, on average. Tests showed repairs did not
appreciably degrade the performance of the code or cause new alerts to appear
(with the possible exception of sqlite3.c). This paper describes unique
contributions that include a new empirical analysis of SA data, our selection
method for flaw categories to repair, publication of our APR tool, and a
dataset of SA alerts from open-source SA tools run on open-source codebases. It
discusses positive and negative results and lessons learned.

TL;DR: 介绍自动化框架REFINE用于对软件工程任务中基于大语言模型的评估器进行基准测试，该框架有可控性，应用于IBM内部工作流程并取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以让大语言模型成为可靠评估器，人类评估成本高、主观且不可扩展，现有自动化方法无法辨别工件质量的细微差异。

Method: 引入REFINE框架，包含层次数据集构建器和评估器测试器两个模块，可控制质量下降粒度。

Result: 应用于IBM内部开发工作流程，在一些编码任务中使对齐分数从低于0.7提升到高于0.9。

Conclusion: REFINE框架有效，能帮助模型训练团队支持模型发布决策。

Abstract: Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language
models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts. However,
establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human
evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated
methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.
  We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation),
an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software
engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder
applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with
progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate
evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with
expected ordering.
  A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of
degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse
filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.
  While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the
practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's
internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and
summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using
industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that
lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.
These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams
to support model release decisions.

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的设计支持无障碍和自适应软件开发的低代码工具的建议。

Abstract: The global ageing population presents a growing societal challenge, creating
an urgent need for inclusive technologies that promote autonomy among older
adults. Software practitioners can address this by delivering digital services
that enhance seniors' independence and reduce reliance on routine support from
family members and healthcare infrastructure. However, traditional development
practices, constrained by time and resources, often result in applications with
major accessibility and personalisation barriers. Increasing pressure from
regulatory requirements, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), and the
personal empathy many developers feel toward supporting their older loved ones
and their own future selves have created a demand for tools that support the
development of accessible and adaptive software. To address this demand, this
paper presents an interview-based empirical study with 18 software
practitioners, evaluating AdaptForge: a low-code model-driven engineering (MDE)
tool that enables the efficient creation of accessible and adaptive
applications for senior users by mitigating development constraints through
automated code generation. Based on these insights, we identify developer
expectations for adopting such tools as industry-standard solutions and provide
empirically grounded recommendations for designing low-code tools that support
accessible and adaptive software development.

Motivation: 当前评估数据集存在缺乏可运行测试用例、偏离真实代码分布、仅能评估Python语言等问题，影响评估结果可信度，需新数据集准确评估大语言模型在实际仓库级代码生成任务中的表现。

Method: 引入MRG - Bench数据集，开展包含大语言模型、长上下文模型和RAG相关方法的实验，设计新实验标注生成错误的根本原因。

Result: 当前仓库级代码生成技术有显著性能缺陷，多数方法难理解用户需求，不同编程语言受不同仓库级上下文影响差异大。

Conclusion: 实际应用中需为不同语言设计专门的上下文信息。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation. However, current evaluation datasets suffer from issues such
as the lack of runnable test cases, deviation from the distribution of
real-world code, and the ability to evaluate only the Python language. These
limitations undermine the credibility of the evaluation results.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MRG-Bench} (Multi-language
Repository-level Code Generation Benchmark), a novel dataset that provides a
more accurate evaluation of LLMs in practical repository-level code generation
tasks. MRG-Bench has three main features: (1) practical data sourced from
real-world code repositories that align to the practical distribution, (2)
multiple programming languages support, including Python, Java, and Go, and (3)
project-level runnable test cases to assess the quality of the generated code.
  Based on MRG-Bench, we conducted extensive experiments including large
language models, long-context models, and RAG-related methods. These evaluation
results demonstrate that \textbf{current repository-level code generation
techniques suffer from significant performance deficiencies}. To further
investigate why models fail, we designed novel experiments to annotate the
underlying causes of generation errors. The results explicitly show that the
majority of methods suffer from "\textbf{difficulty in understanding user
requirements}," failing to comprehend their assigned tasks accurately.
Moreover, the impact of different repository-level contexts on this issue
exhibits significant disparities across different programming languages,
suggesting that, in practice, specialized contextual information needs to be
designed for different languages.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理将问题定位转化为Repo Deep Search任务，需要解决LLM有效利用检索工具进行多步推理和导航的挑战。

Method: 提出ToolTrain，一种结合拒绝采样监督微调与工具集成强化学习的两阶段工具集成训练框架。

Result: ToolTrain训练的模型达到SOTA性能，32B模型在函数级定位上超越Claude - 3.7，且问题定位性能提升带来更好的端到端问题解决性能。

Conclusion: 针对问题定位进行训练是改进自动化软件开发的可行有效策略。

Abstract: Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need
modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in
software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue
descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code
dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating
repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a
demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively
utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning
and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a
two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled
supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance
LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental
results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level
localization. The results also show that improved localization performance
translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further
demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective
strategy for improving automated software development.

<details>

Motivation: 系统模型开发有挑战，且缺乏评估大语言模型生成特定描述语言系统模型能力的基准。

Method: 构建包含151个人工策划场景的SysMBench基准，引入语义感知评估指标SysMEval，用三种传统指标和SysMEval评估17个大语言模型。

Result: 大语言模型在SysMBench上表现不佳，最高BLEU为4%，SysMEval - F1为62%。

Conclusion: 发布SysMBench及其评估框架以推动基于大语言模型的系统模型生成研究。

Abstract: System models, a critical artifact in software development, provide a formal
abstraction of both the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems,
which can facilitate the early requirements analysis and architecture design.
However, developing system models remains challenging due to the specific
syntax of model description languages and the relative scarcity of public model
examples. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
code with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model
development, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to
generate system models with specific description languages. We present
SysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of
popular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a
natural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a
specific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The
requirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with
description language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms
to the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual
validation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to
evaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on
this task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting
to three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows
that LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and
SysMEval-F1 of 62%. We release the SysMBench and its evaluation framework to
enable future research on LLM-based system model generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS)动态调度方案，在两个基于大语言模型的软件工程任务实验中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型部署优化策略多为静态调度，需大量训练数据且增加计算成本，限制适用性和灵活性。

Method: 提出SLS方案，包含自适应缓存管理器、性能 - 成本优化调度器和动态更新管理器三个组件，利用实时反馈更新策略。

Result: 在日志解析和代码生成两个任务中，SLS平均性能提升198.82%，平均处理时间减少63.28%。

Conclusion: SLS显著优于基线方法，是一种有效的动态且经济的调度解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable
capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the
advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high
financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when
handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for
deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires
extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the
computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this
paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective
scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse
tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies
periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an
Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic
Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed
queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and
minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler
dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted
performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific
features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and
scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to
enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate
the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based
software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The
results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving
an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time
reduction of 63.28%.

Conclusion: GUI - ReRank能有效解决GUI检索问题，为检索效果和计算资源权衡提供见解。

Abstract: GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern
interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application
domains. GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by
enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts
collaboratively. Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early
testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end
users and development teams. Despite these advantages, the process of
constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming,
frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise. Recent research has
sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches,
which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models
for specific GUI repositories. However, these methods often suffer from limited
retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.
In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid
embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based
reranking techniques. GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI
repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly
make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of
relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based
RAG workflows. We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI
retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms
SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.
Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of
employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the
trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources. Video:

Motivation: 受监管行业因数据隐私和合规要求，在使用LLM进行代码优化时面临挑战，需兼顾高质量优化和成本效益。

Method: 实施MoA方法，从多个专业LLM直接合成代码，与TurinTech AI的GA系统和单个LLM优化器对比，使用真实工业代码库。

Result: MoA在开源模型中表现出色，节省14.3% - 22.2%成本，优化时间加快28.6% - 32.2%；GA在商业模型有优势，两种集成方法均优于单个LLM；经50个代码片段和7种LLM组合验证。

Conclusion: 研究为生产环境中兼顾监管合规与优化性能的组织提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization
have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering
at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries
face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize
commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements,
creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a
Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple
specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm
(GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world
industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application
to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical
evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost
savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated
environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with
commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4)
Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations,
generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble
evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing
regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码理解和知识共享方面存在语义碎片化、检索效率低、训练数据稀缺过时、专有模型应用受限等问题。

Method: 提出Key - Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT)方法，嵌入知识锚点，合成特定代码数据，通过多种评估方法进行验证。

Result: 合成训练数据贴合信息需求，获超60%人类标注者和79%专家偏好，推理延迟最多降低85%。

Conclusion: KANT适合可扩展、低延迟的本地部署，为代码理解提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core
challenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However,
these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is
distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic
fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade
performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm
attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often
outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy
and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented
Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into
both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access
to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding
inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data
directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context,
reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise
deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the
synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions;
compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference
speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability.
Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking
needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack
expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to
85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency,
on-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.

Abstract: Context: Psychological safety (PS) is an important factor influencing team
well-being and performance, particularly in collaborative and dynamic domains
such as software development. Despite its acknowledged significance, research
on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The
socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development
present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no
systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the
context of software engineering.
  Objective: This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the
existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it
seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with
the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software
development process.
  Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted, encompassing studies
retrieved from four digital libraries. The extracted data were subjected to
both quantitative and qualitative analyses.
  Results: The findings indicate a growing academic interest in PS within
software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson's
framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team,
and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and
leadership behaviors.
  Conclusion: PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within
software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the
contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective
strategies for its enhancement. Future research should address these gaps by
investigating the practical applications of PS within diverse organizational
settings in the software engineering domain.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI systems in 6G software businesses presents both
strategic opportunities and significant challenges. While such systems promise
increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across
distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical
immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and
performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic
mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within
the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted
scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further
categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping
offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping
organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a
feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader
research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model
grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions
possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to
provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess,
structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the

Motivation: 代码克隆会使软件项目臃肿并引发问题，因此识别代码克隆很重要。

Result: StoneDetector不仅能找到精确和语法相似的代码克隆，还能找到因语法差异大而难检测的克隆，在基准测试中展现出性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: StoneDetector是一个多功能的传统克隆检测平台。

Abstract: Copy & paste is a widespread practice when developing software and, thus,
duplicated and subsequently modified code occurs frequently in software
projects. Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code,
can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability
propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present
the StoneDetector platform and its underlying method for finding code clones in
Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone
detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the
code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only
find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code
clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We
demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection
platform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including
the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our
exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and
scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习漏洞修复方法局限于特定语言，大语言模型虽有潜力但效果不佳，需研究其在多语言漏洞修复的性能。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，测试自动化漏洞修复方法和大语言模型在七种编程语言中的表现。

Result: 指令调优的GPT - 4o表现有竞争力，在修复独特和高危漏洞上更优，对未见语言有强泛化能力；Go效果最好，C/C++最差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型用于多语言漏洞修复前景光明，同时分析了失败原因。

Abstract: Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have
been proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However,
these approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities
and strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome
multilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore
LLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address
these limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate
the performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and
state-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o,
instruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the
leading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows
superior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to
repair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o
demonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen
language, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently
achieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs
the worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual
vulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes
the first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages,
highlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual
vulnerability repair.

TL;DR: 企业代码库规模和复杂度增加，导致 lint 错误过多难以手动修复，本文提出 BitsAI - Fix 自动化修复工作流，在字节跳动生产部署中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业代码库中 lint 错误数量远超手动修复能力，导致技术债务积累和开发效率受阻的问题。

Method: 使用 tree - sitter 进行上下文扩展，通过专门训练的大语言模型生成搜索替换格式补丁，采用渐进式强化学习训练策略、针对性的基于规则的奖励机制和“代码差异匹配”方法。

Result: 在字节跳动生产部署中支持超 5000 名工程师，解决超 12000 个静态分析问题，修复准确率约 85%，每周约 1000 名活跃用户。

Conclusion: 证明基于大语言模型的代码修复解决方案在企业环境中的实际可行性，为大规模工业场景下的自动化代码修复提供参考。

Abstract: As enterprise codebases continue to grow in scale and complexity, the volume
of lint errors far exceeds engineers' manual remediation capacity, leading to
continuous accumulation of technical debt and hindered development efficiency.
This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow
based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical
challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for
context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through
specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final
remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative
progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can
automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start
phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through
feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted
rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness
rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff
matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production
deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,
resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%
remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions
in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in
large-scale industrial scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出LaTCoder方法解决MLLMs在设计转代码任务中布局保留问题，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在设计转代码任务中难以准确保留布局，有改进需求。

Method: 借鉴思维链推理，引入LaT增强布局保留。先分割网页设计为图像块，用CoT方法为各块生成代码，再用两种组装策略并动态选择。

Result: 在自动指标上有显著提升，如TreeBLEU分数提高66.67%、MAE降低38%；人工评估中超60%情况更青睐LaTCoder生成的网页。

Conclusion: LaTCoder方法在网页设计转代码任务中能有效增强布局保留，是有效的方法。

Abstract: Converting webpage designs into code (design-to-code) plays a vital role in
User Interface (UI) development for front-end developers, bridging the gap
between visual design and functional implementation. While recent Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in
design-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during
code generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that
enhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with
Layout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet
efficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we
prompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block.
Finally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an
MLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal
output. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs
(i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly
introduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts.
The experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant
improvements. Specifically, TreeBLEU scores increased by 66.67% and MAE
decreased by 38% when using DeepSeek-VL2, compared to direct prompting.
Moreover, the human preference evaluation results indicate that annotators
favor the webpages generated by LaTCoder in over 60% of cases, providing strong
evidence of the effectiveness of our method.

*Iti Shree,Karine Even-Mendoz,Tomasz Radzik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 现有基于大语言模型的编译器模糊测试器生成的测试程序有效性低，本文提出ReFuzzer框架提升测试程序有效性和测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的编译器模糊测试器生成的测试程序存在语法或语义错误，影响对编译器优化和后端组件的测试效果。

Method: 引入ReFuzzer框架，通过反馈循环和本地大语言模型检测并纠正编译和运行时错误，在执行前验证和过滤错误程序。

Result: 在针对LLVM/Clang的黑盒、灰盒和白盒模糊测试中，将测试程序的有效性从47.0 - 49.4%提高到96.6 - 97.3%，平均处理时间为2.9 - 3.5秒，显著提高了关键优化和IR生成组件的代码覆盖率。

Conclusion: ReFuzzer框架有效提高了测试程序的有效性和测试效果。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based compiler fuzzers often produce syntactically or
semantically invalid test programs, limiting their effectiveness in exercising
compiler optimizations and backend components. We introduce ReFuzzer, a
framework for refining LLM-generated test programs by systematically detecting
and correcting compilation and runtime violations (e.g. division by zero or
array out-of-bounds accesses). ReFuzzer employs a feedback loop with a local
LLM to validate and filter erroneous programs before execution, improving
fuzzing effectiveness beyond crash detection and enabling the generation of
diverse yet valid test programs.
  We evaluated ReFuzzer's effectiveness across black-, grey- and white-box
fuzzing approaches targeting LLVM/Clang. ReFuzzer improved test programs'
validity from 47.0-49.4% to 96.6-97.3%, with an average processing time of
2.9-3.5 s per test program on a dual-GPU machine. Further, refuzzing
significantly increased code coverage in critical optimization and IR
generation components. For example, vectorization coverage had an absolute
improvement of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 7.1% in black-, grey-, and white-box fuzzing,
enhancing testing effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成编程练习任务时需生成程序，编写能产生多样且规范代码、易适应新任务的程序生成器有挑战，手动编写多个相关工件的生成器会很复杂。

Method: 指定一组抽象构建块，为每个构建块定义不同工件的具体实现集，将结果工件的预期结构指定为抽象构建块的组合，从抽象描述自动派生相关工件。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，适用于广泛的上下文。

Abstract: When automatically generating programming exercise tasks one often also needs
to automatically generate programs. At the very least when providing sample
solutions is part of automated feedback. But programs can also be used as part
of the exercise task description to communicate a task's requirements.
  Writing good program generators that produce varied yet idiomatic code while
being easily adaptable for new tasks is challenging. The challenges are
intensified if task generation requires additional artifacts, like a more
general behavior specification for testing or additional textual descriptions.
Manually writing generators for multiple different but strongly related
artifacts gets complicated quickly.
  We present an approach where instead of writing monolithic generators for
multiple connected artifacts one specifies a small set of abstract building
blocks and for each such building block defines sets of concrete realizations
for various kinds of artifacts. Then the intended structure of the resulting
artifacts is specified as a composition of the small abstract building blocks.
This abstract description then serves as the common source from which related
artifacts can be derived automatically. The approach is generic in the kind of
artifacts it can produce and is therefore adaptable to a wide range of
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列生成方法和基准在加密货币市场实用性不足，未考虑加密货币市场特性和缺乏金融评估。

Method: 引入CTBench基准，整理452个代币的开源数据集，用13个指标从5个维度评估模型，采用双任务评估框架。

Result: 对八个代表性模型在四种市场制度下进行基准测试，发现统计保真度和实际盈利能力之间的权衡。

Conclusion: CTBench提供模型排名分析和在加密分析与策略开发中选择和部署模型的实用指导。

Abstract: Synthetic time series are essential tools for data augmentation, stress
testing, and algorithmic prototyping in quantitative finance. However, in
cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and
rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and
benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work
(1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses
narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific
complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for
trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the
first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain.
\textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates
TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy,
rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational
efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the
\emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves
temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the
\emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support
mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models
from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering
trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably,
\textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for
selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy
development.

Motivation: 现有信用评级模型多依赖财务指标和深度学习，常忽略非财务数据（如企业年报）信息，需充分挖掘非结构化文本数据价值。

Method: 引入结合财务数据与FinBERT提取年报特征的企业信用评级框架，开发结合传统财务数据和年报文本数据的CCRD数据集。

Result: 提出的方法使评级预测准确率提高8 - 12%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了企业信用评级的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Corporate credit rating serves as a crucial intermediary service in the
market economy, playing a key role in maintaining economic order. Existing
credit rating models rely on financial metrics and deep learning. However, they
often overlook insights from non-financial data, such as corporate annual
reports. To address this, this paper introduces a corporate credit rating
framework that integrates financial data with features extracted from annual
reports using FinBERT, aiming to fully leverage the potential value of
unstructured text data. In addition, we have developed a large-scale dataset,
the Comprehensive Corporate Rating Dataset (CCRD), which combines both
traditional financial data and textual data from annual reports. The
experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the
rating predictions by 8-12%, significantly improving the effectiveness and
reliability of corporate credit ratings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在金融K线数据应用受限，且忽视下游任务，需改进。

Method: 提出Kronos框架，引入专业分词器，用自回归目标在大规模多市场K线数据上预训练。

Result: 在基准数据集上，价格序列预测RankIC提升显著，波动率预测MAE降低，合成K线序列生成保真度提高。

Conclusion: Kronos是端到端金融时间序列分析的强大通用基础模型。

Abstract: The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large
Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation
Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line)
data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures.
Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as
volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these
limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework
tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized
tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,
preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos
using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12
billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced
temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting
across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts
price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the
best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility
forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line
sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation
model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is
publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.

Method: 对28个Curve Finance池一年的历史数据，使用XGBoost、Random Forest、LSTM、Transformer、QNN和QSVM - QNN六种模型进行基准测试，并通过MAE、RMSE和方向准确率评估模型性能。

Result: 经典集成模型（XGBoost和Random Forest）表现优于深度学习和量子模型，量子模型方向准确率低于50%且误差更高。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可复现的基准测试，强调在DeFi领域经典方法比新兴量子方法更稳健。

Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for
accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation
strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest,
LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector
machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data
from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE,
and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models,
particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep
learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy
(71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test
MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with
directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current
limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series
data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into
model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of
classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.

Result: 通过对专有信用卡支付数据集和公开银行账户欺诈数据集的案例研究，展示了框架的有用性。

Conclusion: 框架为评估迁移学习方法提供了途径，有助于理解模型和算法行为，利于在现实环境新领域部署模型时做决策。

Abstract: When the available data for a target domain is limited, transfer learning
(TL) methods can be used to develop models on related data-rich domains, before
deploying them on the target domain. However, these TL methods are typically
designed with specific, static assumptions on the amount of available labeled
and unlabeled target data. This is in contrast with many real world
applications, where the availability of data and corresponding labels varies
over time. Since the evaluation of the TL methods is typically also performed
under the same static data availability assumptions, this would lead to
unrealistic expectations concerning their performance in real world settings.
To support a more realistic evaluation and comparison of TL algorithms and
models, we propose a data manipulation framework that (1) simulates varying
data availability scenarios over time, (2) creates multiple domains through
resampling of a given dataset and (3) introduces inter-domain variability by
applying realistic domain transformations, e.g., creating a variety of
potentially time-dependent covariate and concept shifts. These capabilities
enable simulation of a large number of realistic variants of the experiments,
in turn providing more information about the potential behavior of algorithms
when deployed in dynamic settings. We demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed framework by performing a case study on a proprietary real-world suite
of card payment datasets. Given the confidential nature of the case study, we
also illustrate the use of the framework on the publicly available Bank Account
Fraud (BAF) dataset. By providing a methodology for evaluating TL methods over
time and in realistic data availability scenarios, our framework facilitates
understanding of the behavior of models and algorithms. This leads to better
decision making when deploying models for new domains in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出STAP衡量去中心化交易所（DEX）效率，证明特定交易执行可消除套利机会，用数据观察到DEX效率变化，对比路由算法对DEX效率、交易者回报和流动性提供者的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DEX效率及代币路由算法对市场表现和利益相关者结果的影响。

Method: 引入STAP概念并通过凸优化计算，使用基于Uniswap V2数据的代币图进行观察，对比两种路由算法。

Result: 2024年6月21日至11月8日DEX效率下降，更有利可图的路由算法能提高DEX效率和交易者回报，DFS算法使总锁定价值增加。

Conclusion: STAP是检测套利的可靠指标，采用更有利可图的路由算法能提升DEX效率、交易者回报和为流动性提供者带来更多利益。

Abstract: The efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the influence of token
routing algorithms on market performance and stakeholder outcomes remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the concept of Standardized Total
Arbitrage Profit (STAP), computed via convex optimization, as a systematic
measure of DEX efficiency. We prove that executing the trade order maximizing
STAP and reintegrating the resulting transaction fees eliminates all arbitrage
opportunities-both cyclic arbitrage within DEXs and between DEXs and
centralized exchanges (CEXs). In a fully efficient DEX (i.e., STAP = 0), the
monetary value of target tokens received must not exceed that of the source
tokens, regardless of the routing algorithm. Any violation indicates arbitrage
potential, making STAP a reliable metric for arbitrage detection. Using a token
graph comprising 11 tokens and 18 liquidity pools based on Uniswap V2 data, we
observe a decline in DEX efficiency between June 21 and November 8, 2024.
Simulations comparing two routing algorithms-Yu Zhang et al.'s line-graph-based
method and the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm-show that employing more
profitable routing improves DEX efficiency and trader returns over time.
Moreover, while total value locked (TVL) remains stable with the line-graph
method, it increases under the DFS algorithm, indicating greater aggregate
benefits for liquidity providers.

Motivation: 探索路径签名在非马尔可夫随机波动率模型下对冲奇异衍生品的机器学习应用。

Method: 深度学习中用签名作前馈神经网络特征；浅度学习中比较两种回归方法，一是直接从价格过程的期望签名学习对冲策略，二是用签名波动率模型建模波动率动态。

Result: 深度学习中签名特征多数情况下优于LSTM且训练计算量小；浅度学习中第二种方法在不同收益和波动率动态下结果更准确稳定。

Conclusion: 路径签名在对冲奇异衍生品的机器学习应用中有良好表现，特定方法能取得更好效果。

Abstract: We investigate the use of path signatures in a machine learning context for
hedging exotic derivatives under non-Markovian stochastic volatility models. In
a deep learning setting, we use signatures as features in feedforward neural
networks and show that they outperform LSTMs in most cases, with orders of
magnitude less training compute. In a shallow learning setting, we compare two
regression approaches: the first directly learns the hedging strategy from the
expected signature of the price process; the second models the dynamics of
volatility using a signature volatility model, calibrated on the expected
signature of the volatility. Solving the hedging problem in the calibrated
signature volatility model yields more accurate and stable results across
different payoffs and volatility dynamics.

Abstract: The dual formulation of empirical risk minimization with f-divergence

problem to the ERM-fDR is connected to the notion of normalization function
introduced as an implicit function. This dual approach leverages the
Legendre-Fenchel transform and the implicit function theorem to provide a
nonlinear ODE expression to the normalization function. Furthermore, the
nonlinear ODE expression and its properties provide a computationally efficient
method to calculate the normalization function of the ERM-fDR solution under a
mild condition.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving
time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel
Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that
incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor
extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct
target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised
manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting
power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware
predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor
extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting
task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors.
Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting
model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches.
To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies
to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially
observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on
several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm
achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 建立了拟极大似然估计的一致性，给出采样器的非渐近收敛保证，量化近似误差率。

Conclusion: 实证和模拟评估证明了似然匹配方法的有效性，验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We propose a Likelihood Matching approach for training diffusion models by
first establishing an equivalence between the likelihood of the target data
distribution and a likelihood along the sample path of the reverse diffusion.
To efficiently compute the reverse sample likelihood, a quasi-likelihood is
considered to approximate each reverse transition density by a Gaussian
distribution with matched conditional mean and covariance, respectively. The
score and Hessian functions for the diffusion generation are estimated by
maximizing the quasi-likelihood, ensuring a consistent matching of both the
first two transitional moments between every two time points. A stochastic
sampler is introduced to facilitate computation that leverages on both the
estimated score and Hessian information. We establish consistency of the
quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, and provide non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for the proposed sampler, quantifying the rates of the approximation
errors due to the score and Hessian estimation, dimensionality, and the number
of diffusion steps. Empirical and simulation evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed Likelihood Matching and validate the theoretical
results.

Conclusion: 建立了无限维有效动态的收敛保证。

Abstract: We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of
a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the
high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $y \propto
\sum_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_j \sigma\left(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta_j},
\boldsymbol{x}\rangle\right), \boldsymbol{x} \sim N(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$,
$\sigma$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\lbrace\boldsymbol{\theta}_j
\rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We
consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$,
and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients
$\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis
of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population
limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws
for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the
optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a
precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation
with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees
for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.

Method: 开发动态模拟执行工具、自动绘制转换图的静态工具和自动绘制计算图的静态工具。

Result: 开发出三种可视化工具并展示其使用方法。

Conclusion: 这些工具受学生欢迎且对学生有帮助。

Abstract: Many Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses introduce students to
Turing machine extensions. One of the most widely-used extensions endows Turing
machines with multiple tapes. Although multitape Turing machines are an
abstraction to simplify Turing machine design, students find them no less
challenging. To aid students in understanding these machines, the FSM
programming language provides support for their definition and execution. This,
however, has proven insufficient for many students to understand the
operational semantics of such machines and to understand why such machines
accept or reject a word. To address this problem, three visualization tools
have been developed. The first is a dynamic visualization tool that simulates
machine execution. The second is a static visualization tool that automatically
renders a graphic for a multitape Turing machine's transition diagram. The
third is a static visualization tool that automatically renders computation
graphs for multitape Turing machines. This article presents these tools and
illustrates how they are used to help students design and implement multitape
Turing machines. In addition, empirical data is presented that suggests these
tools are well-received and found useful by students.

Abstract: This article presents a novel framework to provide Formal Languages and
Automata Theory students design support for the development of regular
expressions. This framework includes a design recipe for regular expressions
and a customized error messaging system. The error messaging system produces
recipe-based errors that include the step of the design recipe not successfully
completed. Furthermore, the error messages follow the established practices of
being concise, succinct, jargon-free, and nonprescriptive. In addition, a
shorthand syntax developed for writing unit tests is described. The in-class
use of the design recipe is illustrated, two debugging sessions using the
described system are discussed, and the implementation of the error messaging
system is briefly sketched.

Motivation: 学生在形式语言与自动机理论课程中理解非确定性有限状态和下推自动机有困难，难以理解其操作语义和判断单词接受或拒绝情况，且下推自动机因栈操作更复杂。

Method: 提出两个用于FSM的动态可视化工具，逐步可视化非确定性有限状态机和下推自动机的所有计算，并允许用户视觉验证状态属性。

Result: 无明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 两个动态可视化工具可辅助学生理解自动机设计和进行机器验证。

Abstract: In Formal Languages and Automata Theory courses, students find understanding
nondeterministic finite-state and pushdown automata difficult. In many cases,
this means that it is challenging for them to comprehend the operational
semantics of such machines and, as a consequence, determine why a word is
accepted or rejected. This is not entirely surprising, because students are
mostly trained to design and implement deterministic programs. Comprehension of
pushdown automata is further complicated, because reasoning about the stack is
necessary. A common difficulty students face, for example, is understanding
that two different computations on the same word may reach the same state with
different stack values. To aid student understanding, we present two novel
dynamic visualization tools for FSM -- a domain-specific programming language
for the Automata Theory classroom -- to support the design of such machines.
These tools visualize all computations that may be performed, respectively, by
a nondeterministic finite-state machine or by a pushdown automata in a stepwise
manner. In addition, these tools aid the machine verification process by
allowing users to visually validate whether the properties a state represents
hold when a machine transitions into it.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法作为单次模型，受训练数据潜在知识限制，需创建能自主执行完整无机材料发现周期的智能系统。

Method: 引入SparksMatter模型，该模型可生成想法、设计并执行实验流程、评估和改进结果、提出候选材料，还能自我批判和改进，识别研究差距并建议验证步骤。

Result: 在热电、半导体和钙钛矿氧化物材料设计案例研究中，SparksMatter能生成新型稳定无机结构，在相关性、新颖性和科学严谨性上得分更高，新颖性有显著提升。

Conclusion: SparksMatter有独特能力生成超越现有材料知识的有效、有意义且有创意的无机材料假设。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials
design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet
they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into
their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system
capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle,
from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We
introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic
materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and
executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results,
and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives.
SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research
gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps,
including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization,
embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is
evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and
perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of
SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the
user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter
consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific
rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world
design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate
SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically
meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing
materials knowledge.

ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized
MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated
frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT

Motivation: 机器学习原子间势可靠的不确定性量化（UQ）难以实现，需研究UQ策略。

Method: 研究原子簇扩展框架下的集成学习和D - 最优性两种UQ策略，提出聚类增强局部D - 最优性方法。

Result: 模型精度越高，预测不确定性与实际误差相关性越强、新环境检测越好，D - 最优性估计更保守；两种方法在同质训练集上不确定性校准良好，在异质数据集上低估误差、新环境敏感性降低；聚类增强局部D - 最优性方法显著改善异质数据集新原子环境检测。

Conclusion: 明确了模型保真度和数据异质性在UQ性能中的作用，为MLIP开发的主动学习和自适应采样策略提供实用途径。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable accurate atomistic
modelling, but reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains elusive. In
this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and
D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed
that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted
uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with
D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well
calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict
errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To
address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality,
which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies
D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the
detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings
clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance
and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling
strategies for MLIP development.

'inverse design' capabilities that allow the discovery of new materials given
the desired properties. This review aims to discuss different principles of
AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery,
including different materials representations available for this purpose. We
will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new
catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges
such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability,
and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate
AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models,
physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems. This review
aims to provide insights for researchers aiming to harness AI's transformative
potential in accelerating materials discovery for sustainability, healthcare,

Motivation: 解决资源密集型车辆算法能耗和性能挑战，当前5G非独立组网现实应用研究不足。

Method: 在德国特定路线使用两种AI算法，分析两个平台多种部署策略，测试延迟、往返时间和数据包交付。

Result: 平均信号质量84%，无连接中断，丢包率低于0.1%，传输时间受地理位置和网络连接影响，处理时间受计算硬件影响。

Conclusion: 往返时间超150ms时，云卸载是合适选择。

Abstract: Cloud-based offloading helps address energy consumption and performance
challenges in executing resource-intensive vehicle algorithms. Utilizing 5G,
with its low latency and high bandwidth, enables seamless vehicle-to-cloud
integration. Currently, only non-standalone 5G is publicly available, and
real-world applications remain underexplored compared to theoretical studies.
This paper evaluates 5G non-standalone networks for cloud execution of vehicle
functions, focusing on latency, Round Trip Time, and packet delivery. Tests
used two AI-based algorithms -- emotion recognition and object recognition --
along an 8.8 km route in Baden-W\"urttemberg, Germany, encompassing urban,
rural, and forested areas. Two platforms were analyzed: a cloudlet in Frankfurt
and a cloud in Mannheim, employing various deployment strategies like
conventional applications and containerized and container-orchestrated setups.
Key findings highlight an average signal quality of 84 %, with no connectivity
interruptions despite minor drops in built-up areas. Packet analysis revealed a
Packet Error Rate below 0.1 % for both algorithms. Transfer times varied
significantly depending on the geographical location and the backend servers'
network connections, while processing times were mainly influenced by the
computation hardware in use. Additionally, cloud offloading seems only be a
suitable option, when a round trip time of more than 150 ms is possible.

Abstract: As As autonomous AI agents scale across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized

identity, and capability sharing has become essential. This paper surveys three
prominent registry approaches each defined by a unique metadata model: MCP's
mcp.json, A2A's Agent Card, and NANDA's AgentFacts. MCP uses a centralized
metaregistry with GitHub authenticated publishing and structured metadata for
server discovery. A2A enables decentralized interaction via JSON-based Agent
Cards, discoverable through well-known URIs, curated catalogs, or direct
configuration. NANDA Index introduces AgentFacts, a cryptographically
verifiable and privacy-preserving metadata model designed for dynamic
discovery, credentialed capabilities, and cross-domain interoperability. These
approaches are compared across four dimensions: security, scalability,
authentication, and maintainability. The paper concludes with suggestions and
recommendations to guide future design and adoption of registry systems for the
Internet of AI Agents.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents represents a paradigmatic shift
from traditional web architectures toward collaborative intelligent systems
requiring sophisticated mechanisms for discovery, authentication, capability
verification, and secure collaboration across heterogeneous protocol
environments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework addressing the
fundamental infrastructure requirements for secure, trustworthy, and
interoperable AI agent ecosystems. We introduce the NANDA (Networked AI Agents
in a Decentralized Architecture) framework, providing global agent discovery,
cryptographically verifiable capability attestation through AgentFacts, and
cross-protocol interoperability across Anthropic's Modal Context Protocol
(MCP), Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Microsoft's NLWeb, and standard HTTPS
communications. NANDA implements Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) principles,
extending traditional Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to address autonomous
agent security challenges including capability spoofing, impersonation attacks,
and sensitive data leakage. The framework defines Agent Visibility and Control
(AVC) mechanisms enabling enterprise governance while maintaining operational
autonomy and regulatory compliance. Our approach transforms isolated AI agents
into an interconnected ecosystem of verifiable, trustworthy intelligent
services, establishing foundational infrastructure for large-scale autonomous
agent deployment across enterprise and consumer environments. This work
addresses the critical gap between current AI agent capabilities and
infrastructure requirements for secure, scalable, multi-agent collaboration,
positioning the foundation for next-generation autonomous intelligent systems.

Conclusion: AdaptiveResolver为随着生态系统复杂性增加而不断发展的健壮、面向未来的代理通信奠定了基础。

Abstract: AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address
the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in
distributed, heterogeneous environments. Unlike traditional DNS or static URLs,
AdaptiveResolver enables context-aware, real-time selection of communication
endpoints based on factors such as geographic location, system load, agent
capabilities, and security threats. Agents advertise their Agent Name and
context requirements through Agent Fact cards in an Agent Registry/Index. A
requesting Agent discovers a Target Agent using the registry. The Requester
Agent can then resolve the Target Agent Name to obtain a tailored communication
channel to the agent based on actual environmental context between the agents.
The architecture supports negotiation of trust, quality of service, and
resource constraints, facilitating flexible, secure, and scalable
agent-to-agent interactions that go beyond the classic client-server model.
AdaptiveResolver provides a foundation for robust, future-proof agent
communication that can evolve with increasing ecosystem complexity.

Motivation: 现有商用多加速器计算服务器使用电互连，出现互连带宽墙，导致GPU资源利用率低和闲置。

Method: 开发服务器级可编程光子织物Morphlux来互连服务器内的加速器。

Result: 增强现有光子ML数据中心，租户计算分配带宽最多提高66%，计算碎片化最多减少70%，ML模型训练吞吐量提高1.72倍，可在1.2秒内逻辑替换故障芯片。

Conclusion: Morphlux能有效解决互连带宽问题，提升服务器性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: We optically interconnect accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) within compute
servers using newly viable programmable chip-to-chip photonic fabrics. In
contrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are
workhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in
the server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall
caused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the
interconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to
under-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop
Morphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect
accelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic
ML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant
compute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.
We develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate
these performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training
throughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our
hardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in
1.2 seconds.

the extraction of control flows, data flows, and inter-component communications
(ICCs), all of which are essential for malware detection. However, existing
methods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different
types of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware
nature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We
propose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware
fusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal
is to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related
information for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information
network (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We
further propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that
distinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual
constraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations
through the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally
fed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware
classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
comprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for
assessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale
dataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than
31,000 real-world apps. Experimental results demonstrate that MalFlows
outperforms representative baselines in Android malware detection, and
meanwhile, validate the effectiveness of flow2vec in accurately learning app
representations from the HIN constructed over the heterogeneous flows.

Method: 采用通用LLM进行意图理解，将加密安全推理委托给垂直领域训练的专业模型，模块化分离语言意图解析和隐私关键计算

Result: Agentic - PPML可消除LLM处理加密提示的需求

Conclusion: Agentic - PPML框架能实现以隐私保护的LLM为中心的服务的实际部署

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is critical to ensure data privacy
in AI. Over the past few years, the community has proposed a wide range of
provably secure PPML schemes that rely on various cryptography primitives.
However, when it comes to large language models (LLMs) with billions of
parameters, the efficiency of PPML is everything but acceptable. For instance,
the state-of-the-art solution for confidential LLM inference represents at
least 10,000-fold slower performance compared to plaintext inference. The
performance gap is even larger when the context length increases. In this
position paper, we propose a novel framework named Agentic-PPML to make PPML in
LLMs practical. Our key insight is to employ a general-purpose LLM for intent
understanding and delegate cryptographically secure inference to specialized
models trained on vertical domains. By modularly separating language intent
parsing - which typically involves little or no sensitive information - from
privacy-critical computation, Agentic-PPML completely eliminates the need for
the LLMs to process the encrypted prompts, enabling practical deployment of
privacy-preserving LLM-centric services.

Motivation: 现有攻击无法消除生成模型痕迹，需要更强大的归因模型，探索实现不可追溯DeepFakes的方法。

Method: 设计一种仅使用真实数据训练对抗模型的通用黑盒攻击方法，适用于各种生成模型且不依赖归因模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法攻击能力出色、适用性广，对9个生成模型生成的DeepFakes攻击6个先进归因模型平均成功率达97.08%，有防御机制时成功率超72.39%。

Conclusion: 强调乘法攻击带来的潜在挑战，凸显需要更强大的归因模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in DeepFakes attribution technologies have significantly
enhanced forensic capabilities, enabling the extraction of traces left by
generative models (GMs) in images, making DeepFakes traceable back to their
source GMs. Meanwhile, several attacks have attempted to evade attribution
models (AMs) for exploring their limitations, calling for more robust AMs.
However, existing attacks fail to eliminate GMs' traces, thus can be mitigated
by defensive measures. In this paper, we identify that untraceable DeepFakes
can be achieved through a multiplicative attack, which can fundamentally
eliminate GMs' traces, thereby evading AMs even enhanced with defensive
measures. We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an
adversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and
agnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack
capability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average
attack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes
generated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method
maintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\%. Our work underscores the potential
challenges posed by multiplicative attacks and highlights the need for more
robust AMs.

Motivation: 用户因数据隐私问题无法直接使用LLM API，私有部署计算需求大，在本地资源受限情况下实现安全的LLM适配存在挑战。

Method: 引入VFLAIR - LLM框架，提供两种LLM分区设置，支持三种任务类型和18个数据集，提供实现和评估攻击与防御的标准模块。

Result: 对5种攻击和9种防御在各种分割学习LLM设置下进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 为现实应用中模型分区配置、防御策略和相关超参数的选择提供具体见解和建议。

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM applications have
expanded into a growing number of fields. However, users with data privacy
concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private
deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial
challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources.
To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning
(SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting
LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at
https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split
learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and
fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM
partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition,
we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and
defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning
for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the
choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant
hyperparameters for real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有针对LLM - MAS的攻击方法有效性、适应性和隐蔽性有限，LLM - MAS存在安全漏洞。

Method: 提出MAST框架，结合蒙特卡罗树搜索与直接偏好优化训练攻击策略模型，在篡改过程中施加语义和嵌入相似性双重约束。

Result: 在不同任务、通信架构和大语言模型上的实验表明，MAST攻击成功率高，相比基线显著提高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: MAST有效、隐蔽且适应性强，LLM - MAS需要强大的通信安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively
accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but
this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack
methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct
and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and
stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy
Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within
the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference
Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates
effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve
stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints
during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks,
communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently
achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness
compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness,
stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust
communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.

Abstract: Existing cybersecurity playbooks are often written in heterogeneous,
non-machine-readable formats, which limits their automation and
interoperability across Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
platforms. This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,
combined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident
response playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We
systematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully
design prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for
control flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a
syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative
refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate
the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy
playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook
transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow
structures, and substantially reduces errors. It highlights the potential for
practical deployment in automated cybersecurity playbook transformation tasks.

Motivation: 现代软件依赖LLM代理，其与传统软件不同，现有工具无法关联高层意图和底层动作，存在语义差距，难以区分操作性质。

Method: 采用边界追踪方法，在稳定系统接口从应用代码外部用eBPF监控，拦截TLS加密流量提取语义意图，监控内核事件，用实时引擎和二次LLM分析关联两者。

Result: 评估显示AgentSight能检测提示注入攻击、识别资源浪费推理循环、揭示多代理系统隐藏协调瓶颈。

Conclusion: AgentSight框架可有效解决LLM代理监控和调试中的语义差距问题，且性能开销小。

Abstract: Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for
development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these
AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing
a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates
a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level
intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but
cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to
distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.
We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this
semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors
agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using
eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic
intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally
correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine
and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is
framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3%
performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection
attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden
coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an
open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究多用机器学习改进操作系统，鲜有使用操作系统改进机器学习，且现有工作未针对机器学习场景定制操作系统，本文旨在弥补这一局限。

Method: 提出MaLV - OS，重新设计操作系统架构，包含微内核Micro - LAKE、MLaaS子系统，将模型中系统敏感部分卸载到操作系统，集成开源GPU虚拟化软件。

Result: MaLV - OS架构使虚拟机可动态选择MLaaS策略，还能动态添加新功能到MLaaS子系统。

Conclusion: 通过MaLV - OS这种专门为ML工作负载设计的操作系统架构，有望提升机器学习模型和算法的性能。

Abstract: A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop
learned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to
the job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network
bandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has
in common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and
to the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,
using OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level
optimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML
context. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this
paper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and
algorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS
rethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,
especially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML
applications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,
Micro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an
MLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE
with memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads
system-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity
and programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an
open-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.
For more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to
dynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model
the user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the
MaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the
MLaaS subsystem.

Motivation: 在提供反事实解释时，保护用户隐私，避免其特征向量泄露给机构。

Method: 先提出私有反事实检索（PCR）问题及基线方案，再提出减少机构数据库信息泄露的方案；考虑不可变PCR（I - PCR）场景并提出相应方案；扩展方案以纳入用户属性转换偏好。

Result: 给出数值结果支持理论发现，对比了各方案的数据库信息泄露情况。

Conclusion: 所提出的多种方案能在不同场景下实现用户隐私的信息论保护，并在一定程度上保护机构数据库隐私。

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

Method: 开发基于主体的部分寡头控制经济模型，让具有异质生产函数的企业在增值网络中互动，通过数值模拟量化不同去寡头化政策对GDP增长的影响。

Result: 最优去寡头化策略取决于寡头在产业链中的位置，可针对获取原材料或影响其他交易来拆除寡头结构。

Conclusion: 去寡头化策略应根据寡头在产业链中的位置制定。

Abstract: Oligarchic control exerts significant distortions on economic efficiency.
Ukraine exemplifies this phenomenon, where oligarchs dominate key sectors and
achieve economies of scale through vertical integration of coal mines, steel
mills, and power plants while controlling critical infrastructure (e.g. access
to transportation networks) to stifle competition. Their Soviet-era production
chain monopolization strategies, coupled with political patronage networks
(including both local and national governments), reinforce systemic
inefficiencies and barriers to market entry.
  Although existing studies highlight the developmental benefits of
de-oligarchization, this work advances the literature through computational
modeling. We develop an agent-based model of a partially oligarch-controlled
economy, where firms with heterogeneous production functions interact within a
value-added network. Through numerical simulations, we quantify how different
de-oligarchization policies affect aggregate GDP growth.
  The results indicate that the optimal de-oligarchization strategies are
determined by the position of the oligarch in the production chain. Depending
on the oligarch's position, dismantling oligarchic structures should either
focus on removing oligarchs' access to raw materials or on breaking oligarchs'
influence on other transactions in the production chain.

Result: AI领导力测试表现与对人类团队的因果影响强相关，成功领导者在社交、流体智力和决策技能上得分高，在性别、年龄等方面无差异。

Abstract: We show that the ability to lead groups of humans is predicted by leadership
skill with Artificially Intelligent agents. In a large pre-registered lab
experiment, human leaders worked with AI agents to solve problems. Their
performance on this 'AI leadership test' was strongly correlated with their
causal impact on human teams, which we estimate by repeatedly randomly
assigning leaders to groups of human followers and measuring team performance.
Successful leaders of both humans and AI agents ask more questions and engage
in more conversational turn-taking; they score higher on measures of social
intelligence, fluid intelligence, and decision-making skill, but do not differ
in gender, age, ethnicity or education. Our findings indicate that AI agents
can be effective proxies for human participants in social experiments, which
greatly simplifies the measurement of leadership and teamwork skills.

Motivation: 常见观点认为适应推动生物复杂性增加，但实际规则更微妙，学习理论中复杂性研究更成熟，因此想建立框架研究生物与环境复杂性关系。

Method: 利用进化动力学与学习理论的数学同构性，即复制者方程与顺序贝叶斯学习的同构，将进化类型对应竞争假设，适应度对应观察证据的似然性。

Result: 生物复杂性会进化到与环境复杂性匹配，过复杂或过简单生物分别有过度适应和适应不足问题；频繁变化的环境会降低选择的复杂性。

Conclusion: 过度适应短暂环境特征和应对环境挑战灵活性不足之间的平衡推动最优复杂性出现，反映环境结构，该框架为生物复杂性增减提供新解释。

Abstract: A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an
increase in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of
complexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,
where complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal
complexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a
mathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal
complexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical
isomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between
the replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types
corresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to
likelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization
prevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity
matches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over
to the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity
evolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too
simple organisms suffering from \textit{overfitness} and \textit{underfitness},
respectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal
additional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments
decrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both
evolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between
over-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient
flexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of
optimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers
new ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential
causes for it to increase or decrease in different environments.

Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure
with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. We use the practical
and popular geometric annealing schedule, and use a Langevin diffusion at each
temperature level. The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is
long enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter
than the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of
Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like
the forth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse
allowed error. We also study this algorithm in an illustrative model scenario
where more explicit estimates can be given.

Conclusion: 直接意图 - 任务匹配范式及 NeuroSync 系统能有效解决用户意图与代码的不匹配问题，提升编码体验。

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文探讨日常情绪数据收集挑战，开发AnnoSense框架并评估，讨论其对情绪AI研究的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能设备兴起，收集真实情绪数据需求增加，但标注过程复杂，需探索挑战。

Method: 收集75份调查回复，对公众进行32次访谈，与12名心理健康专家进行3次焦点小组讨论，用结果开发AnnoSense框架，由25名情绪AI专家评估。

Result: 开发出AnnoSense框架，并评估其清晰度、有用性和适应性。

Conclusion: AnnoSense框架有潜力提升现实情境中情绪数据的收集和分析。

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

TL;DR: 研究借助定制安卓应用，探究智能手机特征和自报情境与干预接受度和可行性的关系，发现被动感知数据影响干预接受度，为设计情境感知干预提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过往研究较少探索情境对实际心理健康干预参与度的影响，且对用户接受度关注不足，因此开展研究。

Method: 进行为期两周的实地研究，使用定制安卓应用LogMe收集数据，用汤普森采样强化学习算法构建自适应干预模块，探讨四个研究问题。

Result: 多种被动感知数据显著影响用户对干预的接受度。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计既及时又具实际可操作性的情境感知、自适应干预提供了见解。

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文针对设计过程中面临的时间和资源限制问题，开发StoryEnsemble工具并验证其有效性，推动对AI促进迭代设计实践的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计过程受时间和资源限制，设计师难以广泛探索、收集反馈和重新审视早期假设，难以践行核心设计原则，需更好理解这些挑战。

Method: 开展有15名参与者的形成性研究，基于研究结果开发StoryEnsemble工具，进行有10名参与者的用户研究。

Result: StoryEnsemble能实现设计阶段的快速多向迭代和灵活导航。

Conclusion: 该工作通过引入新颖交互，使探索和迭代更流畅、易操作和吸引人，推动了对AI促进迭代设计实践的理解。

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

TL;DR: 商业元宇宙平台缺乏动态导航辅助，提出Navigation Pixie导航代理，实验证明其效果好，推动VR交互设计等研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业元宇宙平台缺少能动态适应用户兴趣和意图的有效导航辅助，且以往研究在商业场景实现有挑战。

Method: 提出Navigation Pixie，采用松散耦合架构，整合结构化空间元数据与基于大语言模型的自然语言处理，减少平台依赖，并在商业元宇宙平台Cluster上进行跨平台实验。

Result: Navigation Pixie相比固定路线和无代理条件，显著增加停留时间和自由探索，PC和VR-HMD有不同偏好优势。

Conclusion: 该研究推动VR交互设计，建立跨平台评估方法，展示商业元宇宙平台的实证实验框架。

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Motivation: 在未来技术实现前预测其社会和行为影响，以指导技术发展和监管。

Method: 用实验方法模拟未来技术，收集参与者态度和行为的定量数据。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 探讨该方法被边缘化原因、潜在好处及使方法常规化以促进有效性提升。

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

Motivation: 探究大多模态模型中利用实时视频的交互系统对视障人士执行现实辅助任务的潜在好处和挑战。

Method: 让八名视障参与者在不同现实场景使用ChatGPT带视频的高级语音功能。

Result: 当前实时视频AI在静态场景有效，动态场景不足，存在空间和距离信息不准确等问题，还会让用户困惑、不信任。

Conclusion: 提出辅助视频AI代理的改进方向，如增加传感能力、确定干预时机、解决生态和安全问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HCI研究常忽略AI对用户作为知识贡献者角色的重塑，需研究用户与AI的认知关系。

Method: 对不同学科的31位学者进行访谈，开发五部分编码本。

Result: 识别出五种关系类型，反映信任、评估模式、任务和人类认知状态的差异。

Conclusion: 认知角色动态且依赖情境，应超越AI的静态隐喻，采用更细致框架理解人机共建知识。

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经形态雷达框架用于实时低功耗手势识别，系统含雷达前端与神经形态采样器，在数据集上准确率超85%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现实时、低功耗的手势识别，减少传统雷达手势识别管道的内存、功耗和计算开销。

Method: 采用受生物传感启发的事件驱动架构，由24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和自定义神经形态采样器将中频信号转换为基于稀疏脉冲的表示，用轻量级神经网络处理。

Result: 在包含七个用户的五种手势数据集上，实现超85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首次将受生物启发的异步sigma - delta编码和事件驱动处理框架用于基于雷达的手势识别。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

TL;DR: 提出FastInit快速噪声初始化方法，提高视频生成效率和帧间时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法难以兼顾高时间一致性和低计算成本，FreeInit迭代细化增加计算成本。

Method: 学习视频噪声预测网络VNPNet，以随机噪声和文本提示为输入，单次前向传播生成细化噪声，创建大规模数据集训练网络。

Result: 通过多种文本到视频模型实验，提升生成视频质量和时间一致性。

Conclusion: FastInit显著改善视频生成，是可直接用于推理的实用方案，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: 视觉Transformer带来计算视觉的第二次飞跃，有必要了解基于Transformer的神经网络在卫星图像上的表现，且此前未大规模对比其与现代遥感数据。

Method: 比较11种边界框检测和定位算法，将5种基于Transformer的架构与6种卷积网络在3个开源高分辨率遥感图像数据集上对比，训练和评估33个深度神经网络模型。

Result: 基于Transformer的神经网络在多种公开基准数据集上展现出了先进的性能。

Conclusion: 对不同特征提取方法和检测算法下的模型性能进行了讨论和分析。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

Motivation: 现有视觉与语言导航任务中，现成大视觉语言模型潜力未充分挖掘，研究其能否支持该任务及不同动作范式。

Method: 在Room-to-Room (R2R)数据集上微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，并在低级别和全景动作空间评估性能。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集成功率达41%。

Conclusion: 现成大视觉语言模型能学习执行视觉与语言导航，但落后于专用模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

Method: 提出SceneQA场景；开发LVSQA数据集；引入SLFG方法，结合单帧为语义连贯场景帧，利用场景定位和动态帧重组机制。

Result: 该方法在多个长视频基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: SLFG无需修改原模型架构，有良好的即插即用性，能显著提升MLLMs长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

Conclusion: 所提改进策略有效，推动了人体姿态估计技术发展。

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部遮挡时面部滤镜性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入人脸抠图任务，提出FaceMat框架，采用两阶段训练，利用负对数似然损失训练教师模型估计不确定度，通过空间自适应知识蒸馏指导学生模型；构建CelebAMat数据集；明确将皮肤作为前景、遮挡物作为背景重构抠图目标。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了现实视频场景中面部滤镜的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat框架无需辅助输入，适合实时应用，能有效解决面部遮挡问题。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行人重识别中的无监督域适应问题。

Method: 利用CycleGAN生成数据，基于师生网络进行多视图特征多层次聚类得到伪标签，引入可学习的集成融合组件，使用高效通道注意力块和双向平均特征归一化等。

Result: 在三个常见行人重识别无监督域适应实验中，性能显著优于现有方法，各项指标表现出色。

Conclusion: CORE - ReID框架确保融合特征清晰，避免歧义，是解决行人重识别无监督域适应的先进有效方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,

TL;DR: 提出Landsat30 - AU数据集，评估现有VLM在卫星图像上表现不佳，轻量级微调可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集忽略低分辨率、多卫星、长期存档数据，为填补此空白构建Landsat30 - AU数据集。

Method: 构建Landsat30 - AU数据集，包含图像 - 字幕对和VQA样本，通过自举管道策划，利用通用VLM迭代细化和人工验证。

Result: 评估显示现有VLM在卫星图像理解上有局限，轻量级微调Qwen2.5 - VL - 7B可提升性能。

Conclusion: Landsat30 - AU数据集有价值，轻量级微调可改善VLM在卫星图像任务中的表现。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出基于SNN的超轻量级流基事件到事件超分辨率方法，有新编码策略和损失函数，在多数据集表现好且轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机空间分辨率有限，需为资源受限设备设计实时超分辨率方法。

Method: 提出基于SNN的超分辨率方法，引入Dual - Forward Polarity - Split事件编码策略，提出Learnable Spatio - temporal Polarity - aware Loss。

Result: 在多数据集上实现有竞争力的超分辨率性能，显著减小模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: 轻量级设计可将模块嵌入事件相机或用于下游视觉任务前端预处理。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 因缺乏优质数据集，视觉语言模型为图表生成精确无幻觉的说明面临挑战，本文推出ChartCap数据集，设计构建流程和评估指标，实验表明基于该数据集微调的模型表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界图表数据集存在包含无关信息、未充分捕捉结构元素和关键洞察的问题，影响视觉语言模型生成图表说明的质量。

Method: 设计四阶段流程构建ChartCap数据集，使用仅图表可识别数据生成说明并采用基于循环一致性的人工验证；提出视觉一致性得分这一评估指标。

Result: 基于ChartCap数据集微调的模型能持续生成更准确、信息丰富且减少幻觉的说明，超越开源、专有模型和人工标注说明。

Conclusion: ChartCap数据集和评估指标有助于提升视觉语言模型为图表生成说明的质量。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

*Matteo Caligiuri,Francesco Barbato,Donald Shenaj,Umberto Michieli,Pietro Zanuttigh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FedPromo框架，通过优化轻量级代理模型实现大规模基础模型高效适配新领域，减少计算开销，实验显示其在图像分类基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在模型规模增大时，客户端设备需大量计算资源，不可行，需高效适配大规模基础模型到新领域的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段过程，先进行服务器端知识蒸馏，再将紧凑模型编码器部署到客户端，学习可训练分类器并聚合回基础模型，使用正则化策略实现多领域学习。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准上的实验表明，FedPromo在假设客户端资源受限的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedPromo框架能实现大规模基础模型高效适配新领域，平衡性能、隐私和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

*Pingchuan Ma,Xiaopei Yang,Yusong Li,Ming Gui,Felix Krause,Johannes Schusterbauer,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现有视觉模型风格与内容解耦困难，本文提出SCFlow框架，通过学习可逆合并风格与内容实现解耦，在多数据集有良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉模型中显式解耦风格和内容存在挑战，因语义重叠和人类感知主观性，且解耦概念有内在模糊性。

Method: 提出SCFlow框架，学习纠缠和非纠缠表示之间的双向映射，基于三个关键见解，还构建合成数据集。

Result: SCFlow在可控生成任务之外，能在零样本设置下泛化到ImageNet - 1k和WikiArt，取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦可从可逆合并过程中自然出现。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

TL;DR: GPT - 4o等视觉语言模型可从公开图像推断用户位置，威胁地缘隐私。提出GeoShield框架，实验表明其在黑盒设置中优于先前方法，有效保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法不适用于高分辨率图像和低扰动预算场景，且可能引入无关语义内容，无法有效应对视觉语言模型对地缘隐私的威胁。

Method: 提出GeoShield框架，包含特征解耦、曝光元素识别和尺度自适应增强三个模块。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置中始终优于先前方法，以最小的视觉和语义质量影响实现了强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该工作首次探索使用对抗扰动防御先进视觉语言模型的地理位置推断，为日益严重的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: 高光谱解混是高光谱图像应用关键预处理步骤，为提高解混精度。

Method: 基于多层矩阵分解模型，引入TV约束考虑相邻空间相似性，采用L1/2 - 范数稀疏约束表征丰度矩阵稀疏性，用ADMM优化模型。

Result: 实验表明提出的STVMLU方法比其他算法性能更优。

Conclusion: 提出的STVMLU方法在高光谱图像解混中有更好表现。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验验证了UAA的有效性，达到基于数据增强的对抗防御策略新的最优水平。

Conclusion: UAA框架为构建鲁棒模型提供了实用且高效的途径。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

Result: 在VideoCrafter2和AnimateDiff上分别实现36.2%和67.5%的参数减少，维持或超越全量模型性能。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能实现高效且高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织样本切片拼接是病理分析必要步骤，但现有自动拼接方法因组织损失、形态畸变等问题受限。

Method: 使用视觉病理基础模型的潜在特征表示识别不同切片邻域，基于大量语义匹配候选进行鲁棒姿态估计以拼接切片。

Result: 在三个不同组织病理数据集上实验表明，SemanticStitcher能实现鲁棒的全切片图像拼接，在正确边界匹配上始终优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher在组织样本切片拼接任务中具有优越性。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Motivation: 现有方法因传感器测量稀疏和缺乏非平坦地形数据集，在姿态估计精度上有问题且局限于平坦地形，需改进。

Conclusion: BaroPoser方法能有效提高人体姿态估计精度，可用于非平坦地形的全局平移预测。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Method: 提出 DyCAF - Net，包括基于输入条件平衡的颈部、双动态注意力机制和类感知特征自适应三种创新方法。

Result: 通过与 YOLOv8 等架构的消融研究及与 9 个最先进基线的基准测试，在 13 个不同基准上显著提升了精度、mAP@50 和 mAP@50 - 95。

Conclusion: DyCAF - Net 计算效率高、推理速度有竞争力，能适应尺度变化、语义重叠和类不平衡，是医疗成像、监控和自主系统等现实检测任务的可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 提出适用于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的大语言模型后训练量化（PTQ）方法应用于VLMs时性能下降，因未考虑VLMs模态差异。

Method: 提出VLMQ框架，优化重要性感知目标以得到带令牌级重要性因子的增强Hessian矩阵，通过轻量级块级反向传播计算重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试、0.5B - 32B的VLMs上表现达到SOTA，如在2位量化下MME - RealWorld提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ框架能有效解决VLMs量化问题，在低比特设置下效果显著。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

TL;DR: 提出适合视觉文档理解和VQA的MACT框架，含四个小尺度代理，有混合奖励建模和测试时缩放策略，在多基准测试中表现优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型受参数规模限制、缺乏自我修正能力，在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现不佳，影响文档类任务性能。

Method: 提出MACT框架，包含规划、执行、判断和答案四个小尺度代理；提出混合奖励建模和代理级混合测试时缩放策略。

Result: MACT在多个基准测试中表现优异，在15个基准测试中的13个领先，三种变体平均得分排名前三。

Conclusion: MACT框架以较小参数规模取得了出色性能，尤其在长视觉上下文和复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code
will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

*Diana-Nicoleta Grigore,Neelu Madan,Andreas Mogelmose,Thomas B. Moeslund,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出简单知识蒸馏框架SlotMatch，将目标中心表示转移到轻量级学生模型，实验表明学生模型参数少、速度快且性能优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督视频分割任务有挑战，现有基于槽注意力的模型依赖大且计算昂贵的神经网络架构，需更轻量方法。

Method: 提出SlotMatch框架，通过余弦相似度对齐教师和学生槽，无需额外蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 基于SlotMatch的学生模型参数少3.6倍、速度快1.9倍，性能匹配甚至超越教师模型，且超越之前无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架简单有效，无需额外损失。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Fd - CycleGAN图像翻译框架，结合LNE与频率监督，用分布损失度量，实验显示其在多方面优于基线方法，频率引导学习提升图像翻译泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像到图像翻译中潜在表示学习，以更好近似真实数据分布。

Method: 在CycleGAN基础上，集成局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，采用基于分布的损失度量（KL/JS散度和基于对数的相似度度量）。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，相比基线CycleGAN和其他先进方法，Fd - CycleGAN有更好的感知质量、更快的收敛速度和更高的模式多样性，尤其在低数据情况下。

Conclusion: 频率引导的潜在学习显著提升图像翻译任务的泛化能力，该方法在文档恢复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等方面有应用前景，且在训练效率和输出质量上优于基于扩散的生成模型。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

*Hongjun Liu,Chao Yao,Yalan Zhang,Xiaokun wang,Xiaojuan Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出IMAC自监督框架解决跨域EEG信号分类问题，在多个数据集上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类因跨域数据分布偏移面临挑战，需解决不同电极配置等问题。

Method: 采用3D - 2D位置统一映射策略标准化电极布局，引入时空信号对齐，构建通道依赖掩码和重建任务，采用解耦结构分别建模时空信息。

Result: 在10个公开数据集上评估，在跨主体和跨中心验证场景中达到了最先进的分类准确率，在模拟和真实分布偏移下有强鲁棒性，完整性得分超基线方法达35%，分类准确率稳定。

Conclusion: IMAC框架有效解决了跨域EEG信号分类问题，性能优越且鲁棒性强。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 随着生成技术发展，存在恶意利用风险，本文提出VideoGuard方法保护视频免被恶意编辑，采用联合帧优化等手段，实验表明其性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型能力强但有被恶意利用风险，现有研究对视频内容编辑保护不足，需填补这一差距。

Method: 提出VideoGuard方法，通过引入细微扰动干扰生成扩散模型，采用联合帧优化，将所有视频帧作为优化实体，提取视频运动信息并融合到优化目标中，提供优化扰动的管道。

Result: 使用客观和主观指标验证，VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard方法能有效保护视频免受未经授权的恶意编辑，性能良好。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

*Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DrUM方法解决T2I扩散模型个性化生成问题，性能强且适配开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型个性化研究多依赖提示级建模，因输入令牌容量有限导致个性化不准确。

Method: 提出DrUM方法，将用户画像与基于变压器的适配器集成，在潜在空间通过条件级建模实现个性化生成。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现良好，能与开源文本编码器无缝集成。

Conclusion: DrUM无需额外微调，可与广泛使用的基础T2I模型兼容。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 研究文本到图像生成中生成对象的人口统计偏差，提出SODA框架测量偏差，发现模型存在刻板印象和偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究多关注文本到图像生成中人物描绘的偏差，本文研究生成对象更细微普遍的人口统计偏差。

Method: 引入SODA框架，对比含人口统计线索和中性提示生成对象的视觉属性，分析三个先进模型在五个对象类别生成的2700张图像。

Result: 发现特定人口群体与视觉属性有强关联，反映并强化刻板印象和微妙偏差，部分模型输出多样性低，放大视觉差异。

Conclusion: 提出的审计框架可测试模型，揭示刻板印象仍存在于生成模型中，是迈向系统和负责任AI发展的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

TL;DR: 研究大样本群体中血清脂质亚类与视网膜微血管特征的关系，发现不同脂质亚类与视网膜血管特征有不同关联，表明视网膜血管结构可反映循环脂质特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜微血管成像可评估全身血管和代谢健康，但脂质组学与视网膜血管的关联研究不足，故开展本研究。

Method: 采用Spearman相关分析研究脂质亚类与十种视网膜微血管特征的联系，用Benjamini - Hochberg错误发现率调整统计显著性。

Result: FA与视网膜血管扭曲度有关，CE与动静脉平均宽度相关，DAG和TAG与小动脉和小静脉的宽度和复杂性呈负相关。

Conclusion: 视网膜血管结构反映不同循环脂质特征，可作为全身代谢健康的非侵入性标志物，本研究首次在健康人群中将深度学习得到的视网膜特征与脂质组学亚类结合。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Motivation: 现有微型内窥镜研究多基于传统相机，金属透镜虽有潜力但数据采集和算法研究存在差距，需推进新型金属透镜内窥镜研究。

Method: 建立金属透镜内窥镜数据集并进行光学模拟，提出MetaScope神经网络，包含OIA和OCC设计，还采用梯度引导蒸馏增强联合学习。

Result: MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复方面优于现有方法，在真实生物医学场景有出色泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope有效解决金属透镜内窥镜光学问题，推动了新型金属透镜内窥镜的发展。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Abstract: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention
mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural

architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer
that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated
Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet,
showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy.
Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method
encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with
minimal architectural overhead.

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Motivation: 现有机器人课程学习多依赖手动设计，自动化课程学习在简单领域成功，但机器人任务有独特挑战，需要新方法。

Method: 提出Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning (GACL)框架，包括一致处理复杂任务设计的任务表示、自适应课程生成的主动性能跟踪机制、通过交替采样保持目标域相关性的接地方法。

Result: 在受限环境轮式导航和3D受限空间四足运动任务上，比现有方法分别提高6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL框架在机器人课程学习中有效，能提高任务成功率。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

Result: SkeNavigator大幅超越先前的平面图导航方法，在高抽象验证集上SPL相对提高105%。

Conclusion: 提出的SkeNa任务、数据集和导航框架有效，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

TL;DR: 通过设计深度强化鲁棒管模型预测控制器，750 毫克扑翼机器人实现类似昆虫的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫飞行敏捷，而昆虫尺度的空中机器人性能受限，缩小两者性能差距。

Method: 设计深度强化鲁棒管模型预测控制器，用模仿学习方法训练两层全连接神经网络。

Result: 机器人实现类似昆虫的扫视动作，在抗风干扰和误差方面表现出色，还能连续 10 次翻转。

Conclusion: 这是实现昆虫尺度飞行敏捷性的里程碑，启发未来传感和计算自主性研究。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

Result: 与三种最先进方法对比，成功率最高提升30%，计算量相当且解的质量高。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效，能在保证计算量的同时提高成功率和解决方案质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Half of all road accidents result from either lack of driver attention or
from maintaining insufficient separation between vehicles. Collision from the
rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident
in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years.
Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to
alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper
develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to
different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light
assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the
cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs
of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and
electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the
P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain
when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress
the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are
statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based
lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically
significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the
EEG signal.

Abstract: Apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by breathing interruptions
lasting at least ten seconds and occurring more than five times per hour.
Accurate, high-temporal-resolution detection of sleep apnea subtypes -
Obstructive, Central, and Mixed - is crucial for effective treatment and
management. This paper presents an energy-efficient method for classifying
these subtypes using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with high temporal
resolution to address the real-time needs of wearable devices. We evaluate a
wide range of classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
architectures on 1-second ECG windows, comparing their accuracy, complexity,
and energy consumption. Based on this analysis, we introduce SleepLiteCNN, a
compact and energy-efficient convolutional neural network specifically designed
for wearable platforms. SleepLiteCNN achieves over 95% accuracy and a 92%
macro-F1 score, while requiring just 1.8 microjoules per inference after 8-bit
quantization. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) synthesis further
demonstrates significant reductions in hardware resource usage, confirming its
suitability for continuous, real-time monitoring in energy-constrained
environments. These results establish SleepLiteCNN as a practical and effective
solution for wearable device sleep apnea subtype detection.

Result: Veli在分布内和分布外设置中均有强泛化能力，能有效处理传感器漂移和不稳定行为。

Conclusion: Veli可有效解决低成本传感器空气质量监测的问题，无需与参考站共址，消除主要部署障碍。

Abstract: Urban air pollution is a major health crisis causing millions of premature
deaths annually, underscoring the urgent need for accurate and scalable
monitoring of air quality (AQ). While low-cost sensors (LCS) offer a scalable
alternative to expensive reference-grade stations, their readings are affected
by drift, calibration errors, and environmental interference. To address these
challenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent
Inference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference
to correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,
eliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a
disentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the
true pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address
the lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air
Quality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR). AQ-SDR is the largest AQ sensor
benchmark to date, with readings from 23,737 LCS and reference stations across
multiple regions. Veli demonstrates strong generalization across both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, effectively handling sensor
drift and erratic sensor behavior. Code for model and dataset will be made
public when this paper is published.

Motivation: 现有频谱认知方法在不同频谱环境和任务中泛化能力有限、准确率欠佳，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出利用卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制的频谱编码器；开发掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测两个自监督学习任务进行预训练；采用低秩自适应（LoRA）参数高效微调以适应下游任务。

Result: 在频谱感知（SS）任务中，-4 dB信噪比下检测概率提高30%；在异常检测（AD）任务中，曲线下面积（AUC）提升超10%；在无线技术分类（WTC）任务中，准确率提高9.6%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM在频谱认知方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum
utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing
spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal
accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed
SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative
spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the
multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both
fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the
spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are
developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and
transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly
adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum
sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification
(WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over
state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in
the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under
the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.

Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, a method to extract both range and
Doppler information from commercial Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) using
a monostatic (single transceiver) setup. Utilizing the CSI phase in Wi-Fi
sensing from a Network Interface Card (NIC) not designed for full-duplex
operation is challenging due to (1) Hardware asynchronization, which introduces
significant phase errors, and (2) Proximity of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
antennas, which creates strong coupling that overwhelms the motion signal of
interest. We propose a new signal processing approach that addresses both
challenges via three key innovations: Time offset cancellation, Phase alignment
correction, and Tx/Rx coupling mitigation. Our method achieves cm-level
accuracy in range and Doppler estimation for moving targets, validated using a
commercial Intel Wi-Fi AX211 NIC. Our results show successful detection and
tracking of moving objects in realistic environments, establishing the
feasibility of high-precision sensing using standard Wi-Fi packet
communications and off-the-shelf hardware without requiring any modification or
specialized full-duplex capabilities.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems face increasing susceptibility
to advanced beam-stealing attacks, posing a significant physical layer security
threat. This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against
these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing
and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat
assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious
activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that
guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to
overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a
security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive
policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker
detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.

Abstract: Sleep monitoring through accessible wearable technology is crucial to
improving well-being in ubiquitous computing. Although
photoplethysmography(PPG) sensors are widely adopted in consumer devices,
achieving consistently reliable sleep staging using PPG alone remains a
non-trivial challenge. In this work, we explore multiple strategies to enhance
the performance of PPG-based sleep staging. Specifically, we compare
conventional single-stream model with dual-stream cross-attention strategies,
based on which complementary information can be learned via PPG and PPG-derived
modalities such as augmented PPG or synthetic ECG. To study the effectiveness
of the aforementioned approaches in four-stage sleep monitoring task, we
conducted experiments on the world's largest sleep staging dataset, i.e., the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis(MESA). We found that substantial
performance gain can be achieved by combining PPG and its auxiliary information
under the dual-stream cross-attention architecture. Source code of this project

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary
tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit
complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a
priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a
self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation
that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish
between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them.
Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our
knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships
across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant
differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori
information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields.
However, depencencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus
researchers should validate that exposed relationships truely pertain to the
question(s) of interest.

Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for
real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these
sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for
control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising
framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to
jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based
model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the
simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across
varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal
emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing
experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate
model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing
noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided
denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor
data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in
additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of
Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture,
hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental
pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which
defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated
organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there
exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice
using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the
communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding
of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome
communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome
communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a
multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is
conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological
signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart
agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏方法提升设备定向语音检测（DDSD）准确率并确保高效部署，在不同调用场景表现良好且具通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升DDSD准确率以实现自然用户体验，确保高效部署。

Method: 引入自适应知识蒸馏方法，从ASR大预训练声学编码器（教师）转移知识，在冻结的教师编码器上应用特定任务适配器与学生模型联合训练。

Result: 自适应KD在关键词和无关键词调用中，等错误率分别提升26%和19%。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应KD方法有效，且在不同模型架构上具有通用性。

Abstract: Device-directed speech detection (DDSD) is a binary classification task that
separates the user's queries to a voice assistant (VA) from background speech
or side conversations. This is important for achieving naturalistic user
experience. To this end, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance DDSD
accuracy while ensuring efficient deployment. Specifically, we introduce a
novel adaptive KD method that transfers knowledge from general representations
of an ASR large pre-trained acoustic encoder (teacher). We apply task-specific
adapters, on top of the (frozen) teacher encoder, trained jointly with the
student model on DDSD. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive KD outperforms
the student model without distillation in the keyword and keyword-free
(follow-up) invocations, with an improvement of +26% and +19% in terms of Equal
Error Rate, respectively. We also show that this approach generalizes across
the transformer and conformer-based model architectures.

TL;DR: 提出首个用人类反馈迭代优化的神经目标语音提取（TSE）系统，评估显示特定掩码训练的模型效果好，用户更偏好优化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模人类标记错误数据集难收集的问题，提升神经语音提取系统性能。

Method: 允许用户标记TSE输出特定片段生成编辑掩码，用多种自动掩码函数生成合成数据集训练模型。

Result: 基于噪声功率掩码（dBFS）和概率阈值训练的模型表现最佳，与人类标注一致，22名参与者更偏好优化输出。

Conclusion: 人在回路的优化是提升神经语音提取性能的有前景方法。

Abstract: We present the first neural target speech extraction (TSE) system that uses
human feedback for iterative refinement. Our approach allows users to mark
specific segments of the TSE output, generating an edit mask. The refinement
system then improves the marked sections while preserving unmarked regions.
Since large-scale datasets of human-marked errors are difficult to collect, we
generate synthetic datasets using various automated masking functions and train
models on each. Evaluations show that models trained with noise power-based
masking (in dBFS) and probabilistic thresholding perform best, aligning with
human annotations. In a study with 22 participants, users showed a preference
for refined outputs over baseline TSE. Our findings demonstrate that
human-in-the-loop refinement is a promising approach for improving the
performance of neural speech extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成语音保真度高但实时使用效率低，且建模语调与节奏有挑战，需改进。

Method: 提出Diffusion Loss - Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO)框架，将原训练损失融入奖励函数，用自然度分数作反馈，使奖励优化与扩散模型结构对齐。

Result: 在WaveGrad 2上评估，客观指标（UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02）和主观评价显著提升，DLPO音频67%的时间被偏好。

Conclusion: DLPO在实时、资源受限场景下可实现高效、高质量扩散TTS。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high-fidelity speech but are inefficient for
real-time use due to long denoising steps and challenges in modeling intonation
and rhythm. To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy
Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO
integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving
generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores
as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's
structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a
non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant
improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective
evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings
demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in
real-time, resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: TF - MLPNet可在低功耗加速器上实时运行，且在盲语音分离和目标语音提取方面优于现有流式模型。

Abstract: Speech separation on hearable devices can enable transformative augmented and
enhanced hearing capabilities. However, state-of-the-art speech separation
networks cannot run in real-time on tiny, low-power neural accelerators
designed for hearables, due to their limited compute capabilities. We present
TF-MLPNet, the first speech separation network capable of running in real-time
on such low-power accelerators while outperforming existing streaming models
for blind speech separation and target speech extraction. Our network operates
in the time-frequency domain, processing frequency sequences with stacks of
fully connected layers that alternate along the channel and frequency
dimensions, and independently processing the time sequence at each frequency
bin using convolutional layers. Results show that our mixed-precision
quantization-aware trained (QAT) model can process 6 ms audio chunks in
real-time on the GAP9 processor, achieving a 3.5-4x runtime reduction compared

Abstract: Speech synthesis from intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals offers a promising
avenue for restoring communication in individuals with severe speech
impairments. However, achieving intelligible and natural speech remains
challenging due to limitations in feature representation, prosody modeling, and
phase reconstruction. We introduce MiSTR, a deep-learning framework that
integrates: 1) Wavelet-based feature extraction to capture fine-grained
temporal, spectral, and neurophysiological representations of iEEG signals, 2)
A Transformer-based decoder for prosody-aware spectrogram prediction, and 3) A
neural phase vocoder enforcing harmonic consistency via adaptive spectral
correction. Evaluated on a public iEEG dataset, MiSTR achieves state-of-the-art
speech intelligibility, with a mean Pearson correlation of 0.91 between
reconstructed and original Mel spectrograms, improving over existing neural

Method: 采用两阶段框架，第一阶段用基于奖励的优化方法RL - PGD引导模型绕过安全协议生成有害响应；第二阶段用PGD将细微扰动嵌入良性音频载体。

Result: 在Qwen2.5 - Omni - 3B、Qwen2.5 - Omni - 7B和Phi - 4 - Multimodal上实验，成功率超86%。

Conclusion: 展示了一类新的实用音频原生威胁，从理论探索走向可行隐蔽的AI行为操纵方法。

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life,
audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this
convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential
attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a
two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate
state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method
uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human
listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method,
Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the
target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native
responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2,
Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize
subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as
weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous
StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation
framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across
Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a
new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical
exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音乐录音常见的音频质量问题，避免使用多个专业工具和手动调整。

Method: 构建SonicMaster数据集，利用流匹配生成训练范式，基于文本提示学习音频转换。

Result: 客观音频质量指标显示SonicMaster显著提升各伪影类别的音质，主观听力测试表明听众更喜欢处理后的音频。

Conclusion: SonicMaster统一方法在音乐修复和母带处理中有效。

Abstract: Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive
reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo
image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized
equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate
specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce
SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and
mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based
control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply
targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general
restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large
dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common
degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five
enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our
approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an
audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered
versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate
that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact
categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners
prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio,
highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.

TL;DR: 提出EmoSteer - TTS训练无的方法实现语音细粒度情感控制，优于SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统情感控制粗粒度且需大量高质量数据训练，需解决细粒度情感控制问题。

Method: 通过激活导向，先观察修改内部激活子集可改变语音情感，开发训练无算法并构建情感语音数据集。

Result: EmoSteer - TTS能实现细粒度、可解释和连续的语音情感控制，优于SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个在TTS中实现训练无和连续细粒度情感控制的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has shown great progress in recent years. However, most
existing TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via
discrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text
prompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or
unstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for
training. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel
training-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control
(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first
empirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within
a flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of
synthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free
and efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token
searching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into
a wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In
addition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated
emotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and
continuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art
(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves
training-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.

Conclusion: 量子模型在蛋白质结合能预测方面有高效的潜力。

Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular
interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the
natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine
design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have
been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental
techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making
significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has
demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of
quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.
Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,
raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding
energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of
QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer
perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct
architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure
their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with
that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial
neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset
was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen
samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models
achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although
their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models
exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their
classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein
binding energy prediction.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of Earth's gravity field is essential for
tracking mass redistribution processes linked to climate variability,
hydrological cycles, and geodynamic phenomena. While the GRACE and GRACE
Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions have set the benchmark for satellite gravimetry
using low-low satellite to satellite tracking (LL-SST), the precision of
gravity field recovery still strongly depends on the quality of accelerometer
(ACC) performance and the continuity of ACC data. Traditional electrostatic
accelerometers (EA) face limitations that can hinder mission outcomes,
prompting exploration of advanced sensor technologies and data recovery
techniques. This study presents a systematic evaluation of accelerometer data
transplantation using novel accelerometer configurations, including Cold Atom
Interferometry (CAI) accelerometers and hybrid EA-CAI setups, and applying both
analytical and machine learning-based methods. Using comprehensive closed-loop
LL-SST simulations, we compare four scenarios ranging from the conventional
EA-only setup to ideal dual hybrid configurations, with a particular focus on
the performance of transplant-based approaches using different neural network
approaches. Our results show that the dual hybrid configuration provides the
most accurate gravity field retrieval. However, the transplant-based hybrid
setup, especially when supported by machine learning, emerges as a robust and
cost-effective alternative, achieving comparable performance with minimal extra
hardware. These findings highlight the promise of combining quantum sensor
technology and data-driven transplantation for future satellite gravimetry
missions, paving the way for improved global monitoring of Earth's dynamic
gravity field.

Method: 提出Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) 模型，将物理系统建模为内省单元的演化流，重新定义量子核心概念，借鉴唯名论哲学和AI监督理论限制的见解。

Result: QAL提供了一个形态动力学框架，将观察者嵌入系统，用内源性变换取代抽象投影。

Conclusion: QAL为后柏拉图主义、内省基础的物理学提供了新的视角和形式词汇，具有一定的理论价值和应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in
external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of
subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical
systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of
modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert
space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a
form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective
contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams
of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight
theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics
reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a
formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a
vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within
the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We
analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with
standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a
post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.

Conclusion: SecoustiCodec能有效解决现有编解码器语义编码问题，且代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language
models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding,
such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion),
insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack
of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose
SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that
disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook
space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity,
paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between
semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method
based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is
proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens
while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method
based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a
joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic
information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage
optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence.
Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA
(state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps.
The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the
completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo,

Motivation: 解决现实语音系统中训练和测试数据分布不同，以及DSU方法应用于语音数据的挑战，处理关键词检测中的分布外问题。

Method: 提出PatchDSU方法，将输入分割成块并独立增强，在多个数据集上评估PatchDSU、DSU和其他方法，还在噪声条件下评估并探索跨数据集泛化能力。

Result: 在多数情况下，PatchDSU和DSU优于其他方法，PatchDSU在评估场景中改进更稳定。

Conclusion: PatchDSU是解决语音关键词检测中分布外问题的有效方法，有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel at many tasks but rely on the assumption that
training and test data follow the same distribution. This assumption often does
not hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due
to varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.
  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each
neural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the
problem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled
features from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying
DSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static
visual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram
- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a
simple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics
when applied to the entire input.
  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose
PatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and
independently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside
other methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.
Additionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music
noise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing
model performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,
both PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods. Notably, PatchDSU demonstrates
more consistent improvements across the evaluated scenarios compared to other
approaches.

Conclusion: UAV - FPG为无人机通信系统抗干扰策略和智能决策提供强大平台。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant advancements in
communication stability and security through techniques such as frequency
hopping, signal spreading, and adaptive interference suppression. However,
challenges remain in modeling spectrum competition, integrating expert
knowledge, and predicting opponent behavior. To address these issues, we
propose UAV-FPG (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - Frequency Point Game), a
game-theoretic environment model that simulates the dynamic interaction between
interference and anti-interference strategies of opponent and ally UAVs in
communication frequency bands. The model incorporates a prior expert knowledge
base to optimize frequency selection and employs large language models for path
planning, simulating a "strong adversary". Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating the expert knowledge base and the large language
model, with the latter significantly improving path planning in dynamic
scenarios through iterative interactions, outperforming fixed-path strategies.
UAV-FPG provides a robust platform for advancing anti-jamming strategies and
intelligent decision-making in UAV communication systems.

Conclusion: 提出的TransAM方法有效，能提升代理建模效果和回报。

Abstract: Agent modeling is a critical component in developing effective policies
within multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to form beliefs about the
behaviors, intentions, and competencies of others. Many existing approaches
assume access to other agents' episodic trajectories, a condition often
unrealistic in real-world applications. Consequently, a practical agent
modeling approach must learn a robust representation of the policies of the
other agents based only on the local trajectory of the controlled agent. In
this paper, we propose \texttt{TransAM}, a novel transformer-based agent
modeling approach to encode local trajectories into an embedding space that
effectively captures the policies of other agents. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed method in cooperative, competitive, and mixed multi-agent
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
generates strong policy representations, improves agent modeling, and leads to
higher episodic returns.

Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies
in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the
learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents
generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered
approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation
Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages
based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their
success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable
conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable,
the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability,
particularly as environmental complexity increases.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否会在引用流程中引入人口统计学偏见，特别是性别偏见。

Method: 使用化名作者姓名进行控制实验，评估多个大语言模型，改变候选参考文献池中的性别构成并分析不同领域的选择模式。

Result: 发现两种偏见，即对男性作者参考文献的持续偏好和多数群体偏见，大候选池会放大偏见，提示缓解策略效果有限，不同科学领域偏见程度不同，社会科学偏见最小。

Conclusion: 大语言模型会强化或加剧学术认可中的现有性别失衡，在将其集成到高风险学术工作流程之前，需要有效的缓解策略来避免延续科学引用实践中的性别差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research
assistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,
yet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation
workflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven
reference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author
names. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude
Haiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and
analyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of
bias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group
bias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.
These biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly
attenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis
indicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social
sciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce
or exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective
mitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender
disparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into
high-stakes academic workflows.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly
evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper
presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between
Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics,
governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing
projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market
landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and
capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key
integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing
decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3
governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via
intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing
(RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent
operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By
synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight
foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and
outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust,
intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent
interactions.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

Motivation: 人们日常有大量合理性判断，预测这些判断对法律系统构成挑战，法官直觉可能与社会观点不一致，因此探究大语言模型能否学习识别驱动人类合理性判断的模式。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，在多个法律场景中比较人类和模型的超10000次模拟判断。

Result: 某些模型不仅能捕捉表面反应，还可能捕捉到潜在决策架构，在过失判定中更重视社会线索而非经济效率，与人类行为相似。

Conclusion: 研究结果有实际应用，且理解AI是否内化伦理框架对预测其行为很重要。

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that
determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments
challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader
societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs)
can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across
multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate
that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially
their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize
social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring
human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate
intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy
interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument
reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions,
understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks
becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Result: 构建了评估AI社会影响的原型框架。

Conclusion: 该原型框架可补充现有基于风险的方法，是在AI监管中实现自由概念可操作性的第一步。

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm,
with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus
is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration
of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing
the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom.
This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised
framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy
and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the
counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are
developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.
These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that
systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable
Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based
approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept
of freedom in AI regulation.

Conclusion: UNO - CG是一种有效且通用的混合求解器，结合了数据驱动方法和经典求解器的优点。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations
(PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example,
there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with
heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their
behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for
a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical
numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid
theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence
remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging
as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed
accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is
possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both
data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce
UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using
specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence
by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a
modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a
data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate
iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems
involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our
results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number
of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for
homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG
maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where
many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and
robustness.

Method: 研究传感器信号质量如何影响防御者在两种防御上的战略投资。

Result: 传感器质量越高，预防性资源的最优投资增加，反应性资源投资减少；攻击者攻击成功率低时，防御者相对无传感器基线的性能提升最大。

Conclusion: 明确了传感器信号质量与防御投资及安全水平的关系。

Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber
defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard
decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from
succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by
successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation
problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its
investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks,
and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes.
This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the
observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this
uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate
how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment
in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be
achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive
resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with
higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance
improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the
attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.

Conclusion: 所提方法是一种稳健、数据高效且基于统计的迁移学习框架，适用于基于超声导波的结构健康监测。

Abstract: Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for
Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their
integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted
to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale
deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited
generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework
based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage
localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to
have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source
and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling
effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about
dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained
CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed
MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different
composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess
domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a
substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.
Hence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and
statistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.

Result: 在三个数据集上多指标表现优异，实现实时融合，在下游脑肿瘤分类任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时临床部署的高效多模态医学图像融合建立了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from
different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment
planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing
approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context
effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the
cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment.
Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling
efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan
mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the
clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we
propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D
images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively
learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on
three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple
quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the
clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification
tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method
establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion
suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

Conclusion: DeepUFNet模型在预测矩形柱绕流时空壁面压力上表现良好，嵌入物理高频损失控制有益。

Abstract: The wall pressure is of great importance in understanding the forces and
structural responses induced by fluid. Recent works have investigated the
potential of deep learning techniques in predicting mean pressure coefficients
and fluctuating pressure coefficients, but most of existing deep learning
frameworks are limited to predicting a single snapshot using full spatial
information. To forecast spatiotemporal wall pressure of flow past a
rectangular cylinder, this study develops a physics-aware DeepU-Fourier neural
Network (DeepUFNet) deep learning model. DeepUFNet comprises the UNet structure
and the Fourier neural network, with physical high-frequency loss control
embedded in the model training stage to optimize model performance, where the
parameter $\beta$ varies with the development of the training epoch. Wind
tunnel testing is performed to collect wall pressures of a two-dimensional
rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 at an angle of attack of zero
using high-frequency pressure scanning, thereby constructing a database for
DeepUFNet training and testing. The DeepUFNet model is found to forecast
spatiotemporal wall pressure information with high accuracy. The comparison
between forecast results and experimental data presents agreement in
statistical information, temporal pressure variation, power spectrum density,
spatial distribution, and spatiotemporal correlation. It is also found that
embedding a physical high-frequency loss control coefficient $\beta$ in the
DeepUFNet model can significantly improve model performance in forecasting
spatiotemporal wall pressure information, in particular, in forecasting
high-order frequency fluctuation and wall pressure variance. Furthermore, the
DeepUFNet extrapolation capability is tested with sparse spatial information
input, and the model presents a satisfactory extrapolation ability

Motivation: 泛癌分类因高维数据和有限样本量具有挑战性，需要更好方法提升分类性能。

Method: 先进行特征选择，将20,531个基因表达特征减至500个；用cVAE学习基因表达潜在表示，生成合成样本；用合成样本扩充训练集；在扩充数据集上训练两层多层感知器（MLP）分类器。

Result: 扩充框架在测试集上达到约98%的分类准确率，显著优于仅用原始数据训练的分类器。

Conclusion: 基于cVAE的合成数据扩充可显著提高泛癌预测性能，尤其对代表性不足的癌症类别。

Abstract: Pan-cancer classification using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data can inform
tumor subtyping and therapy selection, but is challenging due to extremely high
dimensionality and limited sample sizes. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)
to augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using
801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression
features to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on
this data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on
cancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for
each tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples
(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A
two-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the
augmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high
classification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially
outperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present
detailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier
performance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture
diagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based
synthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction
performance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes.

Abstract: Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and
analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can
support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using
an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an
interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into
daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to
small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog
QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our
dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application
in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&A with diverse types and
difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with
competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665
LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&A dataset to
the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such
as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a
reality.

### [326] [A Genetic Algorithm Framework for Optimizing Three-Impulse Orbital Transfers with Poliastro Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03466)
*Phuc Hao Do,Tran Duc Le*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 本文提出结合遗传算法和Poliastro库的计算框架，用于自主发现共面圆轨道间三脉冲转移轨迹。在两个场景验证其适应性，结果表明能精确收敛或找到更优轨迹，虽有燃料效率但有任务时长的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨道机动规划需最小化推进剂消耗，但解析解缺乏灵活性，需更通用优化方法。

Method: 提出结合遗传算法（GA）和Poliastro轨道力学库的计算框架。

Result: 在低地轨道到地球静止轨道转移中，GA精确收敛到经典霍曼转移；高能转移中，GA找到比霍曼转移节省213.47 m/s的双椭圆轨迹，但任务时长从约1天延长到超140年。

Conclusion: 该框架是快速原型化最优轨迹的强大工具，结合进化算法和开源库是解决复杂天体动力学问题及量化设计权衡的可靠方法。

Abstract: Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at
minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total
velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and
Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack
the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a
computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the
Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal,
three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We
validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer
from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy
transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results
demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO
transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer,
achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's
accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a
superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of
213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however,
necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1
day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful
toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how
combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust
method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their
critical design trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在决策场景应用引发公平性担忧，现有处理偏见的方法实施缺乏集中性。

Method: 开发了FairLangProc Python包，提供自然语言处理公平性方面最新进展的通用实现，且与Hugging Face变压器库兼容。

Result: 推出了FairLangProc包，代码可在https://github.com/arturo - perez - peralta/FairLangProc获取。

Conclusion: FairLangProc包有助于促进偏见缓解技术的广泛使用和民主化。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Motivation: 现有自然语言处理方法未针对构建人物社交网络任务优化，在低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏训练数据。

Method: 提出Taggus管道，使用词性标注和启发式方法组合。

Result: Taggus管道在识别角色和解决共指任务中F1分数达94.1%，交互检测中达75.9%，比现有工具分别提高50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus管道效果良好，提出改进方向，承认测试样本局限，公开管道促进葡萄牙语相关领域发展。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

TL;DR: 现有文档RAG系统评估不足，提出新评估系统Double - Bench，实验揭示模型差距和框架问题，希望为后续研究奠基并计划每年更新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档RAG系统评估存在不足，现有基准聚焦局部、用合成数据且缺乏完整标注，无法反映现实挑战。

Method: 引入大规模、多语言、多模态评估系统Double - Bench，包含多语言多类型文档和查询，查询经人工验证。

Result: 实验表明文本和视觉嵌入模型差距缩小，当前文档RAG框架存在过度自信问题。

Conclusion: 开源的Double - Bench为高级文档RAG系统研究提供基础，计划每年更新基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

Method: 引入ICARE框架，利用大语言模型代理和动态多项选择题问答，两个代理互相提问并根据答案一致性评估。

Result: 临床医生研究表明ICARE比先前指标更符合专家判断，扰动分析证实其对临床内容的敏感性和可重复性，模型比较揭示可解释的错误模式。

Conclusion: ICARE实现了对自动放射学报告生成的透明、可解释评估。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

Conclusion: H&S设计模式能有效防止大语言模型的相关攻击，且在生成响应上表现良好。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

Result: 评估显示该方法能生成更高质量的长故事。

Conclusion: 所提方法可有效解决长故事生成的问题，生成更高质量故事。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Result: 在遵循指令基准测试中各规模模型性能显著提升，Light - IF - 32B 模型超越部分开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 所提框架能促使模型转变推理机制，培养可泛化的推理能力。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Conclusion: RCP - Merging是一种有效的合并长思维链模型和特定领域模型的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

Result: 模型分类性能良好，话题分类AUROC为0.94，情感分类为0.89，分析揭示政党与议会角色关系及话语风格变化。

Conclusion: 意识形态立场和执政责任共同塑造议会话语。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用预训练语言模型难以处理政治辩论内容，需新计算方法助力公民政治审议。

Method: 在大规模英语政治辩论和演讲语料上训练RooseBERT，在四个下游任务上微调评估。

Result: RooseBERT在四个下游任务上显著优于通用语言模型。

Conclusion: 特定领域预训练可提升政治辩论分析性能，RooseBERT被开源供研究。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本嵌入模型多基于监督微调，而计算机视觉中自监督训练成效显著，因此对比文本嵌入对比学习中两种增广策略。

Method: 系统比较文本嵌入对比学习中两种最知名的正样本对生成增广策略，在MTEB和额外的领域内评估中评估嵌入质量。

Result: 裁剪增广明显优于基于丢弃的方法；在域外数据上，自监督微调效果不如监督SOTA模型，但在域内数据上，短时间微调就能产生高质量文本嵌入；表示质量在最后几层变压器层提升，微调最后几层即可达到相似嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 自监督微调在文本嵌入领域有一定潜力，裁剪增广是更好的策略，微调最后几层变压器层可高效提升嵌入质量。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

Motivation: 多数研究依赖虚构角色而非真实人类数据，要评估LLMs预测个体经济决策的能力。

Method: 使用522名韩国参与者在文化消费场景的详细角色信息，系统比较三种多模态LLMs，研究其复制人类选择能力和角色注入方法对预测性能的影响。

Result: LLMs个体预测困难，但有合理的群体行为趋势；常用提示技术不比简单提示好，重建个人叙事和检索增强生成无显著优势。

Conclusion: 研究为用真实人类数据模拟经济行为提供了对LLMs能力的首次全面评估，为计算社会科学中基于角色的模拟提供实证指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

Conclusion: UPLME在处理共情检测回归中的标签噪声问题上有效，优于近期基于变分模型集成的UQ方法。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在叙事生成任务中的性别偏见，引入StereoBias - Stories数据集，有三点关键发现，强调基于心理学评估大语言模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究可能忽略大语言模型生成较长内容时更隐性的性别偏见，因此研究其在叙事生成任务中的性别偏见。

Method: 使用心理学中的性别刻板印象，在叙事生成的开放式任务中研究，引入StereoBias - Stories数据集，分析故事中性别贡献随属性的变化。

Result: （1）无条件提示下模型平均对男性有高度偏见，无关属性可减轻此偏见；（2）组合同一性别刻板印象的多个属性会强化模型行为，男性属性放大偏见，女性属性减轻偏见；（3）模型偏见与心理学分类的事实相符，且模型越大一致性越强。

Conclusion: 强调基于心理学评估大语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Result: 教授区分难易题目的能力有限，Gemini 2.5 表现优于教授，用大语言模型不确定性的监督学习效果更好。

Conclusion: 使用大语言模型不确定性的监督学习可帮助教授更好估算考试题目难度，提高评估质量。

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域转移时因灾难性遗忘导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出KILO框架，利用检索的特定领域知识指导训练，在WikiText - 103预训练并在四个目标领域评估顺序适应。

Result: KILO在反向迁移、正向迁移、F1分数、保留率和训练效率方面始终优于多个强基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识检索和指令提示能有效克服持续学习场景中的领域转移挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有单测试时间缩放（STTS）范式受单代理与奖励模型交互能力限制，集体代理方法可突破单代理系统上限，因此探索CTTS。

Method: 设计SA - MR、MA - SR、MA - MR三种范式研究CTTS最优范式；提出CTTS - MM框架，其中多代理协作采用Agent Collaboration Search（ACS），多奖励模型协作采用Mixture of Reword Models（MoR）。

Result: MA - MR在实验中表现最佳；CTTS - MM在七个主流基准测试中始终获得优越性能。

Conclusion: CTTS - MM框架通过有效利用多代理和多奖励模型协作，能增强大语言模型推理效果，代码将公开。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be
released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在通用基准表现好但在专业套件表现不佳的原因，是缺少领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval，为代码生成基准增加从最小到最大详细程度的提示偏序，应用于HumanEval和ParEval的不同子集，测量pass@1随提示特异性的变化。

Result: 使用Llama - 3.x和Qwen2.5 - Coder的实验表明不同任务有不同程度的提示敏感度。

Conclusion: 明确显式I/O规范、边缘情况处理和逐步分解是提示细节改进的关键驱动因素。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

Method: 使用一套探测技术检查模型内部行为，采用Dirichlet重采样和Gumbel - Softmax技巧等引入随机性。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CarbonPDF技术能有效解决PDF格式可持续性报告中碳足迹问答难题，在该任务上表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

Result: CompassVerifier具备多领域能力，能处理多种答案类型并识别异常响应。

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench将推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code
and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.
