However,\nthe data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and\nprocesses from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts\n(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing\nmultimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and\nstakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the\ncradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI\nagents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom\ndata abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text\nand images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach\nreduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data\navailability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of\nexpert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to\ndirectly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with\nsimilar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop\nwith a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven\nmethod to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown\nmaterial to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar\nmaterials. Compared to human experts picking the closest LCA database entry,\nthis improves MAPE by 120.26%. We analyze the data and compute scaling of this\napproach and discuss its implications for future LCA workflows."}

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches\noutperform the original (greedy) flex distribution."}

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures. FOLTY has\nexcellent empirical behavior, and can answer triadic FOL queries on graphs with\nnearly 70M edges is less than hour on commodity hardware.

This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance\nestimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is\nconstrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each\nobserve different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random\nvector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using\na limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight\nminimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and\nFrobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong\ndata processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data\nProcessing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI\ncoefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional\nSDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent\nchannel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient\nover the state input.\n  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,\nwe compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to\nestablish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs\namong sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on\nthis, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and\ncommunication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.\nUnlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite\nsamples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we\nextend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can\nsignificantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive\nschemes."}

One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation?

Through an\nempirical study and detailed analysis on 1,796,880 mutated quantum circuits, we\ninvestigate (a) each test's ability to detect subtle discrepancies between the\nexpected and actual states of a quantum circuit, and (b) the number of\nmeasurements required to achieve high reliability. The results demonstrate that\nquantum-centric tests, particularly the Statevector test and the Inverse test,\nprovide clear advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, reducing both\nfalse positives and false negatives compared to statistical tests. This work\ncontributes to the development of more robust and scalable strategies for\ntesting quantum software, supporting the future adoption of fault-tolerant\nquantum computers and promoting more reliable practices in quantum software\nengineering."}

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility."}

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries.

Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a\npersonalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to\nachieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models\ntailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and\nprivacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers\nclients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without\nsharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,\nenvironmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server.

In this study, we present a novel approach that leverages\nopen-source models Llama-3-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, Gemma-7B-IT through\nprompt engineering, combined with GPT-2, BERT, and RoBERTa using a joint\nembedding technique, to analyze and predict the evolution of user behavior on\nsocial media over their lifetime. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of\nthese models to forecast future stages of a user's social evolution, including\nnetwork changes, future connections, and shifts in user activities.\nExperimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, with GPT-2\nachieving the lowest perplexity (8.21) in a Cross-modal configuration,\noutperforming RoBERTa (9.11) and BERT, and underscoring the importance of\nleveraging Cross-modal configurations for superior performance. This approach\naddresses critical challenges in social media, such as friend recommendations\nand activity predictions, offering insights into the trajectory of user\nbehavior. By anticipating future interactions and activities, this research\naims to provide early warnings about potential negative outcomes, enabling\nusers to make informed decisions and mitigate risks in the long term."}

We design and\nimplement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,\nand (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We\nfurther propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on\na 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show\nthat symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone\nLLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy\nwith a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of\n82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world\ntestbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and\nresource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.\nDrawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the\nsymbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven\nnetworks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even\nas LLMs advance."}

To address these challenges, we\npropose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from\nthe most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an\ninterpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which\nis specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural\ngrouping of states with respect to treatment.

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations.

EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution\nquality.

One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.\nBuilding on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a\nconformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores\n-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample\np-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:\n(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that\ndegrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier.

We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well\nLLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We\nfirst construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate\nannotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and\ncontrolled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to\nevaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify\ningredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used\nLLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state\nknowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving\nperformance comparable to commercial LLMs."}

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility."}

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility."}

By employing Gemini to\nidentify critical prelude functions, the foundational components underlying the\nmost prevalent obfuscation techniques, and leveraging JSIR for subsequent code\ntransformations, CASCADE effectively recovers semantic elements like original\nstrings and API names, and reveals original program behaviors. This method\novercomes limitations of existing static and dynamic deobfuscation techniques,\neliminating hundreds to thousands of hardcoded rules while achieving\nreliability and flexibility. CASCADE is already deployed in Google's production\nenvironment, demonstrating substantial improvements in JavaScript deobfuscation\nefficiency and reducing reverse engineering efforts."}

Particularly, Darcy flow equation is a fundamental\nequation in fluid mechanics, which plays a crucial role in understanding fluid\nflow through porous media. Bayesian methods provide an effective approach for\nsolving PDEs inverse problems, while their numerical implementation requires\nnumerous evaluations of computationally expensive forward solvers. Therefore,\nthe adoption of surrogate models with lower computational costs is essential.\nHowever, constructing a globally accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional\ncomplex problems demands high model capacity and large amounts of data. To\naddress this challenge, this study proposes an efficient locally accurate\nsurrogate that focuses on the high-probability regions of the true likelihood\nin inverse problems, with relatively low model complexity and few training data\nrequirements. Additionally, we introduce a sequential Bayesian design strategy\nto acquire the proposed surrogate since the high-probability region of the\nlikelihood is unknown. The strategy treats the posterior evolution process of\nsequential Bayesian design as a Gaussian process, enabling algorithmic\nacceleration through one-step ahead prior. The complete algorithmic framework\nis referred to as Sequential Bayesian design for locally accurate surrogate\n(SBD-LAS). Finally, three experiments based the Darcy flow equation demonstrate\nthe advantages of the proposed method in terms of both inversion accuracy and\ncomputational speed."}

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations.

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can\nreliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based\nevaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a\nfraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.
