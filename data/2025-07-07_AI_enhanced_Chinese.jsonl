Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators\nand relations, showing that the M\\\"obius transform map induces a canonical\nisomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes\ncommutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any\ncooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the\n2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many\ninteresting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures\nand convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and\nthus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity\ntheorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra.\nFinally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave\nunder composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of\nthe core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value\nand the Banzhaf index of a compound game.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u501f\u52a9\u4ee3\u6570\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5efa\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u535a\u5f08\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5efa\u7acb\u4ee5\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7ec4\u5408/\u805a\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6240\u6709\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u96c6\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5143\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u662f2 - \u73a9\u5bb6\u8ba8\u4ef7\u8fd8\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u548c2 - \u73a9\u5bb6\u72ec\u88c1\u535a\u5f08\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u8da3\u535a\u5f08\u7c7b\u6784\u6210\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u590d\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u6838\u5fc3\u3001Shapley\u503c\u548cBanzhaf\u6307\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u535a\u5f08\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u89e3\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Currently, developers most\ncommonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and\nwidely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code\nsearch tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic\nstructure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to\nsystematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools\noperate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be\ndifficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural\nlanguage to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural\nlanguage provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to\nentry.\n  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning\ncapabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the\npower of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve\nrelevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search\nDSLs: Semgrep and GQL.

The difficulty arises from complex system\nstructures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information.

The method introduces a shared feature extraction module\nand a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from\nthe source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's\ndiscriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The\nmodel incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are\nlacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.\nThis enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate\nthe stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,\nexperiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class\nimbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key\nmetrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC.

Additionally, we employ a\nstandard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied\nresponses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing\nthe BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index\n(CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events.\nEmpirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed\nuncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index\ncan assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of\nBrexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8131\u6b27\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08BRUI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8fd8\u7528VAR\u5206\u6790\u5b8f\u89c2\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9BRUI\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u521b\u5efaCRUI\u4f5c\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aBRUI\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u80fd\u52a9\u82f1\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u5927\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6c\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6295\u8d44\u7b49\uff0c\u4ee5\u8131\u6b27\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8131\u6b27\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u5236\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6316\u6398\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u300a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4eba\u667a\u5e93\u300b\u6708\u5ea6\u56fd\u5bb6\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08VAR\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5b8f\u89c2\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9BRUI\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u521b\u5efaCRUI\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8868\u660e\u65b0\u7684BRUI\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684BRUI\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u82f1\u56fd\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8131\u6b27\u76f8\u5173\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

LSTM is utilized to predict the stock price using the final\nprocessed features. We construct a portfolio consists of four stocks with\ntrading signals predicted by model. Experiments are conducted by evaluating the\nreturn, Sharpe ratio and max drawdown performance.

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u9009\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u752811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u4e0e\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u752811\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ea6\u7b80\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u5927\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b4\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5728\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u83b7\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u7535\u8111\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u9009\u51fa\u4fdd\u7559\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u754c\u3002"}}

Its weighted counterpart $ed^w(X,Y)$ minimizes the\ntotal cost of edits, which are specified using a function $w$, normalized so\nthat each edit costs at least one. The textbook dynamic-programming procedure,\ngiven strings $X,Y\\in \\Sigma^{\\le n}$ and oracle access to $w$, computes\n$ed^w(X,Y)$ in $O(n^2)$ time. Nevertheless, one can achieve better running\ntimes if the computed distance, denoted $k$, is small: $O(n+k^2)$ for unit\nweights [Landau and Vishkin; JCSS'88] and $\\tilde{O}(n+\\sqrt{nk^3})$ for\narbitrary weights [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz; FOCS'23].\n  In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the weighted edit distance\nproblem, where the goal is to maintain $ed^w(X,Y)$ for strings $X,Y\\in\n\\Sigma^{\\le n}$ that change over time, with each update specified as an edit in\n$X$ or $Y$. Very recently, Gorbachev and Kociumaka [STOC'25] showed that the\nunweighted distance $ed(X,Y)$ can be maintained in $\\tilde{O}(k)$ time per\nupdate after $\\tilde{O}(n+k^2)$-time preprocessing; here, $k$ denotes the\ncurrent value of $ed(X,Y)$.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

(Accepted)", "summary": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific\napplications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to\nlarge-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the\nalgorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the\nblock level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to\nfacilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dGCN\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAIRES\u7b97\u6cd5 - \u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GCN\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u77e9\u9635\u5757\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u94fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "AIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e\u81f31.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901fGCN\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design.

Submitted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively).

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design.

Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2\nThinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs\noutperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward\npasses.

Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive\nevaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

We explain these phenomena by connecting\ncollapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and\nanalyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that\naccurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and\nquantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u574d\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f29\u653e\u6781\u9650\u652f\u914d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u635f\u5931\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\uff1b\u5206\u6790SGD\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u53ef\u584c\u7f29\u5230\u4e00\u6761\u901a\u7528\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u574d\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u8d85\u574d\u7f29\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u6b21\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u574d\u7f29\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0cSGD\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u8d85\u574d\u7f29\u8d77\u6e90\u3002"}}

On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,\nservice providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,\nconsequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive\nranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt\ncoupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as\norder volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to\nmarket fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints\nis a critical research challenge.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration.

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling.

We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions.

Mguni"], "title": "High-Order Deep Meta-Learning with Category-Theoretic Interpretation", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive\nhigher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,\nsolve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning.

Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local\nimage patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To\naddress this, we introduce \\textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for\nautoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local\ntokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.\nBesides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the\nAR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic\ntokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal\nattention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the\nde-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module\nto control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive\nexperiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and\noutperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \\textbf{2.59 FID}\nand \\textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the\nholistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image\nproperties such as textures, materials, and shapes.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios.

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning.

However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective\nperturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first\nsystematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under\nrealistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings\nreveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable\nportion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the\nfeature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this\nperspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the\nperturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the\nclean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.\nOur study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses\nand underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the\nsecurity and privacy risks posed by VC.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision.

These tasks are traditionally executed with a\nlinear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their\nlocation, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of\nwhich, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario\n(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).\nHowever, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,\nwhile making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to\nerrors of the first task (location).

To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on\nmulti-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,\nstatistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,\nthereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class\nimbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is\ndesigned, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through\nparallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.\nSimultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify\ncritical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor\ninteractions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to\nimprove the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results\non three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the\nproposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion\nnetwork (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,\nsignificantly outperforming existing approaches.

We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and\nhealthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for\npredictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct\ntarget variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation\nbetween high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.\nData scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable\nthrough bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and\nresource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem\n(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable\nfor another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,\npredictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable\nto capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,\nwe present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better\nsupport the art and science of target variable construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u8bbf15\u4f4d\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u62fc\u8d34\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5c06\u6a21\u7cca\u6982\u5ff5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df8\u4f4d\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df7\u4f4d\u517115\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u8d34\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u6d4b\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u652f\u6301\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u652f\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to\nstochastically output either a \"poisoned\" or benign response, then upvotes the\npoisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used\nin a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability\nof producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts.
