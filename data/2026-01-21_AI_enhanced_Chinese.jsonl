First, regarding temporal fair division without scheduling, we prove that while constant-factor $\u03b1$-TEFX is impossible in general, a $1/2$-approximation is achievable for generalized binary valuations and identical days with two agents. Second, regarding temporal fair division with scheduling, we demonstrate that a scheduling buffer of size at least $n/2$ enables TEF1 for identical days.

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $\u03a3_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX).

The treatment of redistricting in computational social choice has essentially focused on the process of determining \"appropriate\" districts. In this work, we are interested in understanding the gamut of options left for the \"losing\" party, and so we consider the flip side of the problem: Given fixed/predetermined districts, can a given party still make their candidates win by strategically placing them in certain districts? We dub this as \"recampaigning\" to capture the intuition that a party would redirect their campaigning efforts from one district to another. We model recampaigning as a computational problem, consider natural variations of the model, and study those new models through the lens of (1) (polynomial-time many-one) interreducibilities, (2) separations/collapses (both unconditional and axiomatic-sufficient), and (3) both worst-case and parametrized complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u9009\u533a\u91cd\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9009\u533a\u4e0b\u4e00\u65b9\u653f\u515a\u80fd\u5426\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5b89\u6392\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u83b7\u80dc\uff0c\u5c06\u6b64\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5bf9\u9009\u533a\u91cd\u5212\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u201c\u5408\u9002\u201d\u9009\u533a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u60f3\u4e86\u89e3\u201c\u5931\u8d25\u201d\u653f\u515a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5373\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9009\u533a\u4e0b\u653f\u515a\u80fd\u5426\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5b89\u6392\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u83b7\u80dc\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u91cd\u65b0\u7ade\u9009\u5efa\u6a21\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\uff081\uff09\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u4e00\u5f52\u7ea6\u6027\u3001\uff082\uff09\u5206\u79bb/\u574d\u7f29\uff08\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u516c\u7406\u5145\u5206\uff09\u3001\uff083\uff09\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

Unlike the standard fair division model, agents may derive positive or negative utility not only from items allocated directly to them, but also from items allocated to other agents. Since exact envy-freeness cannot be guaranteed, prior work has focused on its relaxations. However, two central questions remained open: does there always exist an allocation that is envy-free up to one item (EF1), and if not, what is the optimal relaxation EF-$k$ that can always be attained?\n  We settle both questions by deriving tight asymptotic bounds on the number of items sufficient to eliminate envy. We show that for any instance with $n$ agents, an allocation that is envy-free up to $O(\\sqrt{n})$ items always exists and can be found in polynomial time, and we prove a matching $\u03a9(\\sqrt{n})$ lower bound showing that this result is tight even for binary valuations, which rules out the existence of EF1 allocations when agents have externalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u6d88\u9664\u5ac9\u5992\u6240\u9700\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\u4ee5\u53ca EF - k \u7684\u6700\u4f18\u677e\u5f1b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u5728\u5176\u677e\u5f1b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46 EF1 \u5206\u914d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u4f18\u677e\u5f1b EF - k \u4e3a\u4f55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u6d88\u9664\u5ac9\u5992\u6240\u9700\u7269\u54c1\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7d27\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e n \u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u5728 O(\u221an) \u7269\u54c1\u4e0b\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u7684\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u627e\u5230\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684 \u03a9(\u221an) \u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u4e8c\u5143\u4f30\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u7d27\u5bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u65f6\u6392\u9664\u4e86 EF1 \u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86 EF - k \u7684\u6700\u4f18\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a O(\u221an)\u3002"}}

Source code available at https://github.com/Mahesh-Ramani/math-portfolio", "summary": "This paper presents a two-phase algorithm for computing exact Catalan numbers at an unprecedented scale. The method is demonstrated by computing $C(n)$ for $n = 2,050,572,903$ yielding a result with a targeted $1,234,567,890$ decimal digits. To circumvent the memory limitations associated with evaluating large factorials, the algorithm operates exclusively in the prime-exponent domain. Phase 1 employs a parallel segmented sieve to enumerate primes up to $2n$ and applies Legendre's formula to determine the precise prime factorization of $C(n)$. The primes are grouped by exponent and serialized to disk. Phase 2 reconstructs the final integer using a memory-efficient balanced product tree with chunking. The algorithm runs on a time complexity of $\u0398(n(\\log n)^2)$ bit-operations and a space complexity of $\u0398(n \\log n)$ bits.

Traditional research has largely focused on time-series forecasting and single-company analysis, relying on numerical data for stock price prediction. While such approaches can provide short-term insights, they are limited in capturing relational patterns, competitive dynamics, and explainable investment reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge graph schema specifically designed for the stock market, modeling companies, sectors, stock indicators, financial statements, and inter-company relationships. By integrating this schema with large language models (LLMs), our approach enables multi-hop reasoning and relational queries, producing explainable and in-depth answers to complex financial questions. Figure1 illustrates the system pipeline, detailing the flow from data collection and graph construction to LLM-based query processing and answer generation.

This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u8fea\u62dc\u4ea4\u901a\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u603b\u4f53\u548c\u884c\u4eba\u4e8b\u6545\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u653f\u7b56\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4ea4\u901a\u78b0\u649e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u8fea\u62dc\u4ea4\u901a\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67902024\u5e7411\u6708\u81f32025\u5e746\u6708\u4ea4\u901a\u78b0\u649e\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u7528\u5361\u65b9\u68c0\u9a8c\u548cCramer's V\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eGetis - Ord Gi*\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u70ed\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u53cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\uff08IDW\uff09\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u6790\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6709\u660e\u663e\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u591c\u95f4\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u4e0b\u5348\u9ad844%\uff1b\u884c\u4eba\u4e8b\u6545\u5728\u6df1\u591c\u9ad8\u53d1\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u603b\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u70ed\u70b9\u5728\u8fea\u62dc\u5317\u90e8\u3001\u897f\u5317\u90e8\u548c\u516c\u8def\u6cbf\u7ebf\uff0c\u884c\u4eba\u70ed\u70b9\u5728\u897f\u5357\u90e8\u5de5\u4e1a\u533a\u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u51fa\u964d\u4f4e\u591c\u95f4\u9650\u901f\u3001\u52a0\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u6cd5\u3001\u6539\u5584\u9053\u8def\u7167\u660e\u548c\u5728\u70ed\u70b9\u5b9e\u65bd\u884c\u4eba\u4e13\u9879\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u653f\u7b56\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis.

However, due to the lengthy prompts and the resource constraints, mobile RAG systems exhibit significantly high response latency. On this issue, one promising approach is to reuse intermediate computational results across different queries to eliminate redundant computation. But most existing approaches, such as KV cache reuse and semantic cache reuse, are designed for cloud settings and perform poorly, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of mobile RAG.\n  We propose PerCache, a novel hierarchical cache solution designed for reducing end-to-end latency of personalized RAG applications on mobile platforms. PerCache adopts a hierarchical architecture that progressively matches similar queries and QKV cache to maximize the reuse of intermediate results at different computing stages. To improve cache hit rate, PerCache applies a predictive method to populate cache with queries that are likely to be raised in the future.

Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs.

Using tools from reliability and survival analysis, we show that SD dominance arises under heavy-tailed regimes, characterized by decreasing hazard rates or increasing reverse hazard rates. Conversely, when both tails are light -- equivalently, when the hazard rate is increasing and the reverse hazard rate is decreasing -- the GMD dominates the SD.\n  We further demonstrate that these dominance relations are preserved under affine transformations, mixtures, convolutions, and tail truncation, and we extend the analysis to discrete distributions.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows. The pipeline is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and an RL agent is trained to make runtime decisions such as selecting full, partial, or no test execution in order to maximize throughput while minimizing testing overhead.\n  A configurable CI/CD simulation environment is developed to evaluate the approach across build, test, and deploy stages. Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728DevOps\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e2dCI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ba1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u505a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u51cf\u5c1125%\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u6f0f\u68c0\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u7684DevOps\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684CI/CD\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A latent variable Phillips curve hypothesis is formulated and tested using 3,968 randomly generated factor combinations. Evidence from US core PCE inflation between Q1 1983 and Q1 2025 suggests that latent variable PC models reliably outperform traditional PC models six to eight quarters ahead and stand a greater chance of outperforming a univariate benchmark. Incorporating an MA(1) residual process improves the accuracy of empirical PC models across the board, although the gains relative to univariate models remain small.

This paper develops a Bayesian framework for latent state inference and parameter estimation in such partially observed MVSDEs. We combine time-discretization with particle-based approximations to construct tractable likelihood estimators, and we design two particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithms: a single-level PMCMC method and a multilevel PMCMC (MLPMCMC) method that couples particle systems across discretization levels. The multilevel construction yields correlated likelihood estimates and achieves mean square error $(O(\\varepsilon^2))$ at computational cost $(O(\\varepsilon^{-6}))$, improving on the $(O(\\varepsilon^{-7}))$ complexity of single-level schemes. We address the fully law-dependent diffusion setting which is the most general formulation of MVSDEs, and provide theoretical guarantees under standard regularity assumptions.

In such settings, surrogate models built from a limited set of simulations can substantially reduce the computational burden, provided that the design of computer experiments is enriched efficiently. In this context, we propose an active learning approach that, for a fixed evaluation budget, targets the most informative regions of the input space to improve sensitivity analysis accuracy. More specifically, our method builds on recent advances in active learning for sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures, DGSM) that exploit derivatives obtained from a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. By leveraging the joint posterior distribution of the GP gradient, we develop acquisition functions that better account for correlations between partial derivatives and their impact on the response surface, leading to a more comprehensive and robust methodology than existing DGSM-oriented criteria.

This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant \"HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity\" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates.

These are not \\textit{rare events} and cannot be evaluated using traditional disruption models focused on infrequent events. Instead, sustained volatility induces opportunistic behavior, as firms repeatedly reconfigure partners in absence of long-term contracts, often due to trust deficits. The resulting web of transient relationships forms opportunistic supply chains (OSCs). To capture OSC evolution, we develop an integrated mathematical framework combining a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to represent stochastic price volatility, a Bayesian learning model to describe adaptive belief updates regarding partner reliability, and a Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG) network model for endogenous changes in network structure. This framework is implemented in an agent-based simulation to examine how volatility, trust, and network structure jointly shape SC resilience. Our modeling approach identifies critical volatility threshold; a tipping point beyond which the network shifts from a stable, link-preserving regime to a fragmented regime marked by rapid relationship dissolution. We analytically establish monotonic effects of volatility on profitability, trust, and link activation; derive formal stability conditions and volatility-driven phase transitions, and show how these mechanisms shape node importance and procurement behavior. These theoretical mechanisms are illustrated through computational experiments reflecting industry behaviors in fast fashion, electronics, and perishables.

First, the nowcasting framework is completely out-of-sample and free of look-ahead bias by construction: predictions are collected at the current edge of time, ensuring the AI has no knowledge of future outcomes. Second, this temporal design is irreproducible -- once the information environment passes, it can never be recreated. Third, our framework is 100% agentic: we do not feed the model news, disclosures, or curated text; it autonomously searches the web, filters sources, and synthesises information into quantitative predictions. We find that AI possesses genuine stock selection ability, but only for identifying top winners. Longing the 20 highest-ranked stocks generates a daily Fama-French five-factor plus momentum alpha of 18.4 basis points and an annualised Sharpe ratio of 2.43. Critically, these returns derive from an implementable strategy trading highly liquid Russell 1000 constituents, with transaction costs representing less than 10\\% of gross alpha. However, this predictability is highly concentrated: expanding beyond the top tier rapidly dilutes alpha, and bottom-ranked stocks exhibit returns statistically indistinguishable from the market.

However, the true accuracy of these regret estimates remains unclear. Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost.

As relQuery services become more widely adopted in applications such as AI-powered spreadsheets, fast response times under concurrent query loads are increasingly important. Unfortunately, current LLM engines face severe latency bottlenecks from Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking across three comparable inference phases: waiting, core running, and tail running. Existing static priority scheduling methods only address HoL blocking during the waiting phase, leaving two critical problems unsolved. First, the absence of a priority update mechanism causes inaccurate prioritization and continued HoL blocking during core execution. Second, suboptimal prefill-decode batching exacerbates HoL blocking in tail execution and worsens latency trade-offs between running and waiting relQueries. To address these problems, we propose RelServe, an optimized LLM engine for low-latency relQuery serving. RelServe features two core innovations: a Dynamic Priority Updater that continuously adjusts priorities while minimizing overhead via statistical approximations, and an Adaptive Batch Arranger that quantitatively evaluates candidate prefill and decode batches to minimize projected average latency. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets using LLMs ranging from 13B to 70B parameters show that RelServe reduces average serving latency by up to 3.1x compared to vLLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRelServe\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5f15\u64ce\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4erelQuery\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4vLLM\u5e73\u5747\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e3.1\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "relQuery\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u67e5\u8be2\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728HoL\u963b\u585e\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRelServe\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u6392\u5668\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6301\u7eed\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u6392\u5668\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u4f30\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u4ece13B\u523070B\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cRelServe\u6bd4vLLM\u5e73\u5747\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e3.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "RelServe\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4erelQuery\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9LLM\u5f15\u64ce\u7684HoL\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In structured and repetitive corpora such as regulatory filings, chunk similarity alone often fails to distinguish between documents with overlapping language. Practitioners often flatten metadata into input text as a heuristic, but the impact and trade-offs of this practice remain poorly understood. We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation. Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks.

To address this challenge, we introduce {Computation-Bandwidth-Memory Trade-offs}, termed the {AI Trinity}, a unified paradigm that positions {computation}, {bandwidth}, and {memory} as coequal pillars for next-generation AI infrastructure. AI Trinity enables dynamic allocation of resources across these pillars, alleviating single-resource bottlenecks and adapting to diverse scenarios to optimize system performance. Within this framework, AI Trinity identifies three fundamental trade-offs: (1) {More Computation$\\rightarrow$Less Bandwidth}, wherein computational resources are exploited to reduce data transmission under limited bandwidth conditions, (2) {More Bandwidth$\\rightarrow$Less Memory}, which exploits abundant communication capacity to populate or refresh memory when local storage resources are constrained, and (3) {More Memory$\\rightarrow$Less Computation}, whereby storage capacity are utilized to mitigate redundant computation when computational costs are prohibitive. We illustrate the effectiveness of AI Trinity through representative system designs spanning edge-cloud communication, large-scale distributed training, and model inference. The innovations embodied in AI Trinity advance a new paradigm for scalable AI infrastructure, providing both a conceptual foundation and practical guidance for a broad range of application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u9047\u786c\u4ef6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAI Trinity\u8303\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u786c\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u5236\u7ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AI Trinity\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86AI Trinity\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "AI Trinity\u8303\u5f0f\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc"}}

In the proposed algorithm, historical results of fireflies' motions are used in hypothesis testing to limit the motions of fireflies that are suggested by current information exchanges between fireflies only to those that are potentially useful. Hypothesis testing is applied to the mechanism of an ordinary firefly algorithm (FA) without changing its structure. As a result, the implementation of the proposed algorithm is simple and straightforward. Limiting the motions of fireflies to those that are potential useful results in reduction of firefly evaluations, and, subsequently, reduction of computational efforts. To test the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, it is used to solve several truss topology optimization problems, including some benchmark problems.

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $\u03c4^{\u0394,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_\u0394$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u987a\u5e8f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f52\u56e0\u9700\u68c0\u67e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Stack\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5f3a\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u5f31\u540c\u6b65\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u53d1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u4fdd\u7559\u5408\u53d6\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\u4f7f\u5f31\u540c\u6b65\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5f3a\u540c\u6b65\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u9700\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u540c\u65f6\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f52\u56e0\u9700\u68c0\u67e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score.

We employ \\textbf{Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution} to recover the impulse response kernels of investor flows, revealing a dual-channel market structure: Foreign and Institutional investors act as ``architects'' of price discovery (positive permanent impact), while Individual investors act as liquidity providers (negative total impact). However, using \\textbf{Multivariate Hawkes Processes}, we demonstrate that this structure is fragile. We find that individual investor order flow exhibits near-critical self-excitation (Branching Ratio $\\approx$ 0.998). During periods of high retail herding, the market undergoes a \\textbf{phase transition} into a ``critical state.'' In this regime, the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, causing the price impact of sophisticated investors to reverse from positive to negative.

Applied to the German day-ahead market, our model outperforms both classic fundamental and state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies.

Recent score-matching approaches to SIVI (SIVI-SM) address this issue via a minimax formulation, at the expense of an additional lower-level optimization problem. In this paper, we propose kernel semi-implicit variational inference (KSIVI), a principled and tractable alternative that eliminates the lower-level optimization by leveraging kernel methods. We show that when optimizing over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the lower-level problem admits an explicit solution, reducing the objective to the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD). Exploiting the hierarchical structure of semi-implicit distributions, the resulting KSD objective can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. We establish optimization guarantees via variance bounds on Monte Carlo gradient estimators and derive statistical generalization bounds of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$.

In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.\n  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.\n  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead. These findings suggest that modest configuration changes can yield significant cost savings without compromising system reliability.\n  Rather than proposing new logging mechanisms, this work offers a lightweight and accessible framework to help small engineering teams reason about log retention policies through a cost-effectiveness lens. The study aims to encourage more deliberate observability configurations, particularly in resource-constrained cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51cf\u81f314\u5929\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u8d85\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u9690\u6027\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u6210\u672c\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f307\u300114\u300130\u548c90\u5929\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u6210\u672c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4ece90\u5929\u51cf\u81f314\u5929\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e78%\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8d8597%\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u957f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\u6548\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5ea6\u53d8\u66f4\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u4f18\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Using 8,790 newly harmonised Functional Urban Areas (FUAs), micro-founded labour-market regions encompassing 3.9 billion people and representing approximately 80% of global GDP, we show that national aggregates systematically, and increasingly, misrepresent the dynamics of growth, convergence, and structural change. Drawing on high-resolution global GDP data and country-level capability measures, we find that the middle-income trampoline that previously drove global convergence is flattening. This divergence in the lower-income regime does not reflect poverty traps: low-income FUAs exhibit positive expected growth, and the transition curve displays no stable low-income equilibrium. Instead, productive capabilities, proxied by the Economic Complexity Index, define distinct growth regimes. FUAs converge within capability strata but diverge across them, and capability upgrading follows a predictable J-curve marked by short-run disruption and medium-run acceleration. These findings suggest that national convergence policies may be systematically misaligned with the geographic scale at which capability accumulation operates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5168\u7403\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u8f6c\u5411\u56fd\u5185\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u8bef\u5224\u53d1\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u2018\u8df3\u677f\u2019\u53d8\u5e73\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u79ef\u7d2f\u5730\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u7403\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u8f6c\u79fb\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53cd\u6620\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20", "method": "\u4f7f\u75288790\u4e2a\u65b0\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\uff08FUAs\uff09\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5168\u7403GDP\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u5c42\u9762\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u589e\u957f\u3001\u8d8b\u540c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u4e2d\u7b49\u6536\u5165\u2018\u8df3\u677f\u2019\u53d8\u5e73\uff1b\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u5730\u533a\u6709\u6b63\u589e\u957f\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u65e0\u8d2b\u56f0\u9677\u9631\uff1b\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u5c42\u51b3\u5b9a\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5448J\u66f2\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d8b\u540c\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4"}}

While concurrent game semantics naturally capture the synchronous interactions characteristic of many cyber-physical systems (CPS), their adoption in CPS design remains limited. Building on the concept of permissive strategy templates (PeSTels) for turn-based games, we introduce concurrent (permissive) strategy templates (ConSTels) -- a novel representation for sets of randomized winning strategies in concurrent games with Safety, B\u00fcchi, and Co-B\u00fcchi objectives. ConSTels compactly encode infinite families of strategies, thereby supporting both offline and online adaptation. Offline, we exploit compositionality to enable incremental synthesis: combining ConSTels for simpler objectives into non-conflicting templates for more complex combined objectives. Online, we demonstrate how ConSTels facilitate runtime adaptation, adjusting action probabilities in response to observed opponent behavior to optimize performance while preserving correctness. We implemented ConSTel synthesis and adaptation in a prototype tool and experimentally show its potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u53d1\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u677f\uff08ConSTels\uff09\u6765\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u53d1\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u83b7\u80dc\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e76\u53d1\u6e38\u620f\u8bed\u4e49\u867d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CPS\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728CPS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u677f\uff08PeSTels\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ConSTels\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u91cf\u7efc\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u4f5c\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ConSTel\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "ConSTels\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\\% of trials.

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u501f\u9274\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5728GPT - 2 - medium\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u72b6\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u6216\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4e9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u590d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5728GPT - 2 - medium\u4e0a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e94\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u56e0\u7d20\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6307\u6807\u59cb\u7ec8\u9ad8\u4e8e\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u901a\u9053\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8868\u5f81\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u5f62\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

The dynamics of the dependence matrix' eigenvalues are modeled in a score-driven way, while biases in the unconditional eigenvalue spectrum are resolved by non-linear shrinkage. The dynamic parameterization of the copula dependence matrix ensures that it satisfies the appropriate restrictions at all times and for any dimension. The model is parsimonious, computationally efficient, easily scalable to high dimensions, and performs well for both simulated and empirical data. In an empirical application to financial market dynamics using 100 stocks from 10 different countries and 10 different industry sectors, we find that our copula model captures both geographic and industry related co-movements and outperforms recent computationally more intensive clustering-based factor copula alternatives. Both the spectral dynamics and the regularization contribute to the new model's performance. During periods of market stress, we find that the spectral dynamics reveal strong increases in international stock market dependence, which causes reductions in diversification potential and increases in systemic risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ef4\u65f6\u53d8\u3001\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b0Copula\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u3001\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u7684Copula\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316Copula\u4f9d\u8d56\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u6d01\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5730\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u52a8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u56e0\u5b50Copula\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5e02\u573a\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u8c31\u52a8\u6001\u663e\u793a\u56fd\u9645\u80a1\u5e02\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u90fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u80a1\u5e02\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u5f3a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6563\u6295\u8d44\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

The data span 2,557 days from January 2019 through December 2025 in a large North American region. Three findings emerge. First, GBV concentrates more heavily in mid-range horizons: beyond 90 days, GBV tail mass typically exceeds Nights by 20-50%, with ratios reaching 75% at the 180-day threshold during peak seasons. Second, Gamma and Weibull distributions fit comparably well under interval-censored cross-entropy. Gamma wins on 61% of days for Nights and 52% for GBV, with Weibull close behind at 38% and 45%. Lognormal rarely wins (<3%). Nonparametric GAMs achieve 18-80x lower CRPS but sacrifice interpretability. Third, generalized Pareto fits suggest bounded tails for both metrics at thresholds below 150 days, though this may partly reflect right-truncation at 365 days; above 150 days, estimates destabilize. Bai-Perron tests with HAC standard errors identify five structural breaks in the Wasserstein distance series, with early breaks coinciding with COVID-19 disruptions. The results show that volume and revenue lead-time shapes diverge systematically, that simple two-parameter distributions capture daily pmfs adequately, and that tail inference requires care near truncation boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790Airbnb\u4e24\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8ba2\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u8ba2\u6536\u5165\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5f62\u72b6\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Airbnb\u4e2d\u9884\u8ba2\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u8ba2\u6536\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u65e5\u57280 - 365\u5929\u7684\u5206\u914d\u89c6\u4e3a\u6210\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528Gamma\u3001Weibull\u3001Lognormal\u5206\u5e03\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u975e\u53c2\u6570GAMs\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u4e49Pareto\u62df\u5408\u548cBai - Perron\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "GBV\u5728\u4e2d\u671f\u89c6\u91ce\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1bGamma\u548cWeibull\u5206\u5e03\u62df\u5408\u8f83\u597d\uff1b\u5e7f\u4e49Pareto\u62df\u5408\u663e\u793a\u9608\u503c\u4e0b150\u5929\u6709\u754c\u5c3e\uff1bBai - Perron\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8ba2\u91cf\u548c\u9884\u8ba2\u6536\u5165\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5f62\u72b6\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u53cc\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u6bcf\u65e5\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u622a\u65ad\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u3002"}}

Motivated by the observation that LLM embeddings exhibit distinct states, suggesting discrete semantic representations, we explore the application of these mathematical tools to analyze semantic relationships. We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics.

Skhosana", "Najmeh Nakhaei Rad"], "title": "Robust semi-parametric mixtures of linear experts using the contaminated Gaussian distribution", "categories": ["stat.ME", "stat.CO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Semi- and non-parametric mixture of regressions are a very useful flexible class of mixture of regressions in which some or all of the parameters are non-parametric functions of the covariates. These models are, however, based on the Gaussian assumption of the component error distributions. Thus, their estimation is sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed error distributions. In this paper, we propose semi- and non-parametric contaminated Gaussian mixture of regressions to robustly estimate the parametric and/or non-parametric terms of the models in the presence of mild outliers. The virtue of using a contaminated Gaussian error distribution is that we can simultaneously perform model-based clustering of observations and model-based outlier detection.

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u52a8\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u5f3a\u51f8\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u957f\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u5206\u6790SGD\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u754c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u9879\uff0c\u52a8\u91cf\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u60ef\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u969c\u788d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86SGD\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u52a0\u901f\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

We show that these features fundamentally reshape industry dynamics along three dimensions. First, because downstream demand depends on relative capability, innovation by one firm endogenously depreciates the economic value of rivals' existing capital, generating a persistent innovation pressure we term the Red Queen Effect. Second, falling inference prices induce downstream firms to adopt more compute-intensive agent architectures, rendering aggregate demand for compute super-elastic and producing a structural Jevons paradox. Third, learning from user feedback creates a data flywheel that can destabilize symmetric competition: when data accumulation outpaces data decay, the market bifurcates endogenously toward a winner-takes-all equilibrium. We further characterize conditions under which expanding upstream capabilities erode downstream application value (the Wrapper Trap). A calibrated agent-based model confirms these mechanisms and their quantitative implications.

Traditional dynamic pricing models, often relying on deterministic EV-CS pairings and network equilibrium assumptions, frequently oversimplify user behavior and lack scalability. This study proposes a stochastic, behaviorally heterogeneous dynamic pricing framework formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The upper level optimizes time-varying pricing to maximize system-wide utility, while the lower level models decentralized EV users via a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model incorporating price sensitivity, battery aging, risk attitudes, and network travel costs. Crucially, the model avoids network equilibrium constraints to enhance scalability, with congestion effects represented via queuing-theoretic approximations. To efficiently solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, a rolling-horizon approach combining the Dynamic Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis-guided Cross-Entropy Method (PSA-CEM) with the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) is implemented. A real-world case study in Clayton, Melbourne, validates the framework using 22 charging stations.

Because of its $\\mathrm{NP}$-hardness, one often turns to heuristics for good solutions. Many such heuristics have been empirically tested and perform rather well. However, it is not well understood why their results are so good or even what guarantees they can offer regarding their runtime or the quality of their results. For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^4\\log^2(n)\\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum. For our proof we use techniques which are already quite popular for the analysis of randomized algorithms. We further apply a special method to analyze a reversible Markov Chain, which arises as a result of our modeling. This method has not yet found wide application in this kind of runtime analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We evaluate TransMode-LLM using both general-purpose models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) and reasoning-focused models (o3-mini, o4-mini) with varying sample sizes on real-world travel survey data. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the LLM-based approach achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baseline classifiers models. Moreover, few-shot learning significantly improves prediction accuracy, with models like o3-mini showing consistent improvements of up to 42.9\\% with 5 provided examples. However, domain-enhanced prompting shows divergent effects across LLM architectures. In detail, it is helpful to improve performance for general-purpose models with GPT-4o achieving improvements of 2.27% to 12.50%.

Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \\ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents.

While recent systems have decoupled the prefill and decode stages to improve throughput, they still rely on unified scheduling policies that fail to adapt to heterogeneous workload characteristics.

PLA-Serve disaggregates multi-turn long-prefill requests from short-prefill ones and introduces a length-aware smart batching mechanism for short-prefill workloads. It adopts a dual-queue design that supports temporal disaggregation on a single prefill instance or spatial disaggregation across multiple instances. For short-prefill batches, a batch waiting window and CUDA Graph-based clustering mitigate interference from heterogeneous computation, reducing batching delay and lowering average latency. In real multi-turn workloads, PLA-Serve reduces prefill latency by over 30% compared to vanilla SGLang under prefill**--**decode disaggregation, and further decreases SLO violations by 28% in multi-instance deployments with vanilla data-parallel configuration. Compared to the SGLang router with load balancing, it further lowers SLO violations by 12% in multi-GPU settings.

Particular instances for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented. Then, we use our model to prove the Turing-completeness of SLS algorithms in general. The proof uses our framework to construct a GA able to simulate any Turing machine.

We propose a training-time interpretability view that tracks token-level attributions across finetuning epochs. We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive.

However, these apparent successes break down under trading backtests: models like GANs or WGAN-GP frequently collapse, yielding extreme and unrealistic results that make the synthetic data unusable in practice. We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance.

The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in regional capability structures, with states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi exhibiting consistently high complexity, while others remain concentrated in ubiquitous, low-value industries. The analysis also shows a strong positive relationship between complexity metrics and per-capita Gross State Domestic Product, underscoring the role of capability accumulation in shaping economic performance. Additionally, the number of active firms in India demonstrates a persistent exponential growth at an annual rate of 11.2%, reflecting ongoing formalization and industrial expansion. The ordered binary matrix displays the characteristic triangular structure observed in complexity studies, validating the applicability of complexity frameworks at the sub-national level. This work highlights the usefulness of firm-based data for assessing regional productive structures and emphasizes the importance of capability-oriented strategies for fostering balanced and sustainable development across Indian states.

Motivated by scheduling problems arising in RPA, we study the parameterized complexity of the single-machine problem $1|\\text{prec},r_j,d_j|*$. We focus on parameters naturally linked to RPA systems, including chain-like precedences, the number of distinct processing times, and the structure of the time windows. We show that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of chains, even with only two prescribed processing times and two distinct time-window lengths.

Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins.

However, existing multimodal inference systems typically employ monolithic architectures that tightly couple the Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages on homogeneous hardware, neglecting the heterogeneous computational characteristics of each stage.

To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration. Leveraging the Ascend interconnect topology, EPD-Serve introduces asynchronous feature prefetching between Encode and Prefill stages and a hierarchical grouped KV cache transmission mechanism between Prefill and Decode stages to improve cross-node communication efficiency. In addition, EPD-Serve incorporates multi-route scheduling, instance-level load balancing, and multi-stage hardware co-location with spatial multiplexing to better support diverse multimodal workloads. Comprehensive experiments on multimodal understanding models demonstrate that, under high-concurrency scenarios, EPD-Serve improves end-to-end throughput by 57.37-69.48% compared to PD-disaggregated deployment, while satisfying strict SLO constraints, including TTFT below 2000 ms and TPOT below 50 ms.

To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance.

We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u592a\u7b3c\u7edf\uff0c\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1a\u805a\u7c7b\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u603b\u7ed3\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Crello\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2dPRISM\u5e73\u5747\u6392\u540d1.49\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u66f4\u9752\u7750PRISM\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u8d34\u5408\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The problem is formulated as a supervised classification task involving a one-step-ahead rolling window. A diverse feature set is constructed, comprising original prices, volatility-based technical indicators, and a novel class of nowcasting features derived from mutual OHLC ratios. The framework is evaluated on data from healthcare indices in the U.S. and Indian markets over a five-year period spanning multiple economic phases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 0.8 and Matthews correlation coefficients above 0.6. Notably, the proposed nowcasting features have emerged as a key determinant of the market movement. We have employed the Shapley-based explainability paradigm to further elucidate the contribution of the features: outcomes reveal the dominant role of the nowcasting features, followed by a more moderate contribution of original prices.

In the literature, various circular-circular and circular-linear regression models have been studied and applied to different real-world problems. However, there are no models for addressing zero-inflated circular observations in the context of longitudinal studies. Motivated by a real case study, a mixed-effects two-stage model based on the projected normal distribution is proposed to handle such issues. The interpretation of the model parameters is discussed and identifiability conditions are derived. A Bayesian methodology based on Gibbs sampling technique is developed for estimating the associated model parameters.

Our framework requires no runtime execution and analyzes PTX code, a low-level instruction set for CUDA-enabled GPUs. It is validated across a diverse set of GPUs and kernels, including multi-head attention, convolution, and matrix multiplication. FlipFlop achieves 83% accuracy in identifying locally optimal energy-efficient configurations, while also minimizing developer effort by reducing the optimization search space by 93.4%. For multi-head attention kernels, it yields up to 79% energy savings and 106% throughput gains relative to NVIDIA's occupancy heuristic.

We develop a three-layer general equilibrium framework to study how this non-convex technology reshapes market structure, transition dynamics, and social welfare. In a static vertical differentiation model, we show that the GenAI cost shock induces a kinked production frontier that bifurcates the market into exit, AI, and human segments, generating a ``middle-class hollow'' in the quality distribution. To analyze adjustment paths, we embed this structure in a mean-field evolutionary system and a calibrated agent-based model with bounded rationality. The transition to the AI-integrated equilibrium is non-monotonic: rather than smooth diffusion, the economy experiences a temporary ecological collapse driven by search frictions and delayed skill adaptation, followed by selective recovery. Survival depends on asymmetric skill reconfiguration, whereby humans retreat from technical execution toward semantic creativity. Finally, we show that the welfare impact of AI adoption is highly sensitive to pollution intensity: low congestion yields monotonic welfare gains, whereas high pollution produces an inverted-U relationship in which further AI expansion reduces total welfare. These results imply that laissez-faire adoption can be inefficient and that optimal governance must shift from input regulation toward output-side congestion management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u8f6c\u578b\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u53ca\u798f\u5229\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u8f93\u51fa\u7aef\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6269\u6563\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u8d8b\u8fd1\u96f6\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u4e00\u822c\u5747\u8861\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5782\u76f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6709\u754c\u7406\u6027\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u5c42\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u7a7a\u5fc3\u201d\uff1b\u8f6c\u578b\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6682\u65f6\u751f\u6001\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u798f\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7531\u653e\u4efb\u91c7\u7528AI\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6cbb\u7406\u5e94\u4ece\u6295\u5165\u76d1\u7ba1\u8f6c\u5411\u8f93\u51fa\u7aef\u62e5\u5835\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\\times$ to $105\\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\\times$ to $266\\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency.

However, the rise of GenAI is driving a fundamental transformation in how people produce, structure, and reuse information - one that these paradigms no longer fully capture. This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to \"farm\" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition.

The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Context - Aware MCP\uff08CA - MCP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u4e14\u65e0\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1CA - MCP\uff0c\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u80fd\u8bfb\u5199\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u4e13\u7528MCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u548cREALM - Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCA - MCP\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5931\u8d25\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CA - MCP\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Underwater swarm robotics offers a promising framework that extends the capabilities of individual autonomous platforms through collective coordination. Inspired by natural systems, such as fish schools and insect colonies, bio-inspired swarm approaches enable distributed decision-making, adaptability, and resilience under challenging marine conditions. Yet research in this field remains fragmented, with limited integration across algorithmic, communication, and hardware design perspectives. This review synthesises bio-inspired coordination mechanisms, communication strategies, and system design considerations for underwater swarm robotics. It examines key marine-specific algorithms, including the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm, Whale Optimisation Algorithm, Coral Reef Optimisation, and Marine Predators Algorithm, highlighting their applications in formation control, task allocation, and environmental interaction. The review also analyses communication constraints unique to the underwater domain and emerging acoustic, optical, and hybrid solutions that support cooperative operation. Additionally, it examines hardware and system design advances that enhance system efficiency and scalability.

We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines. Under Controller Area Network (CAN) injection and LiDAR spoofing attacks, it improves Success Rate (SR) to 0.68 and 0.80, lowers the Disengagement Rate under Attack (DRA) to 0.37 and 0.03, and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0.34 and 0.11.

Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%.

Tong", "Weng Kee Wong"], "title": "Gradient Flow for Finding E-optimal Designs", "categories": ["math.OC", "stat.CO"], "comment": "43 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "We investigate the use of Wasserstein gradient flows for finding an $E$-optimal design for a regression model. Unlike the commonly used $D$- and $L$-optimality criteria, the $E$-criterion finds a design that maximizes the smallest eigenvalue of the information matrix, and so it is a non-differentiable criterion unless the minimum eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity equals to one. Such maximin design problems abound in statistical applications and present unique theoretical and computational challenges. Building on the differential structure of the $2$-Wasserstein space, we derive explicit formulas for the Wasserstein gradient of the $E$-optimality criterion in the simple-eigenvalue case. For higher multiplicities, we propose a Wasserstein steepest ascent direction and show that it can be computed exactly via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We develop particle approximations that connect infinite-dimensional flows with finite-dimensional optimization, and provide approximation guarantees for empirical measures.

The proposed approach extends applicability to a broader class of $f$-divergences than previously reported and yields theoretical results that recover previously known results. Additionally, the difference between the expected empirical risk of the ERM-$f$DR solution and that of its reference measure is characterized, providing insights into previously studied cases of $f$-divergences. A central contribution is the introduction of the normalization function, a mathematical object that is critical in both the dual formulation and practical computation of the ERM-$f$DR solution. This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers.

This paper develops a Stackelberg queueing model where the platform selects a liability share and a staffing level while physicians choose between AI-assisted and independent diagnostic modes. Physician mode choice exhibits a threshold structure, with the critical liability share decreasing in loss severity and increasing in the effort cost of independent diagnosis. Optimal platform policy sets liability below this threshold to trade off risk transfer against compliance costs, revealing that liability sharing and staffing function as substitute safety mechanisms. Higher congestion or staffing costs tilt optimal policy toward AI-assisted operation, whereas elevated loss severity shifts the preferred regime toward independent diagnosis. The welfare gap between platform and social optima widens with loss severity, suggesting greater scope for incentive alignment in high-stakes settings.

Various generalizations of this problem have been applied in numerous engineering domains. However, practical applications are often hindered by the computational challenges associated with deriving numerical results for moments and distributions. In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process.

As data volumes grow and workloads become more complex, these problems have become exponentially harder to solve efficiently. Quantum computing, especially quantum annealing, is a promising paradigm that can efficiently explore very large search spaces through quantum tunneling. It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver). Recently, quantum annealing providers have offered more low-latency solutions, e.g., NL-Solver, which paves the road to actually realizing quantum solutions within DBMSs. However, this raises new systems research challenges in balancing efficiency and solution quality.\n  In this talk, we show that this balance is possible to achieve. As a proof of concept, we present Q2O, the first real Quantum-augmented Query Optimizer. We show the end-to-end workflow: we encode the join order problem as a nonlinear model, a format solvable by the NL-Solver, using actual database statistics; the solution is translated into a plan hint that guides PostgreSQL's optimizer to produce a complete plan. Q2O is capable of handling actual queries in real time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u6848\u51fa\u73b0\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668Q2O\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u56e0\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u65b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u6848\u5e26\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQ2O\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u63a5\u987a\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NL-Solver\u6c42\u89e3\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u5212\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcPostgreSQL\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "Q2O\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, most existing architectures employ a decoupled pipeline: long sequences are first compressed with a query-token based sequence compressor like LONGER, followed by fusion with dense features through token-mixing modules like RankMixer, which thereby limits both the representation capacity and the interaction flexibility. This paper presents HyFormer, a unified hybrid transformer architecture that tightly integrates long-sequence modeling and feature interaction into a single backbone. From the perspective of sequence modeling, we revisit and redesign query tokens in LRMs, and frame the LRM modeling task as an alternating optimization process that integrates two core components: Query Decoding which expands non-sequential features into Global Tokens and performs long sequence decoding over layer-wise key-value representations of long behavioral sequences; and Query Boosting which enhances cross-query and cross-sequence heterogeneous interactions via efficient token mixing. The two complementary mechanisms are performed iteratively to refine semantic representations across layers. Extensive experiments on billion-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that HyFormer consistently outperforms strong LONGER and RankMixer baselines under comparable parameter and FLOPs budgets, while exhibiting superior scaling behavior with increasing parameters and FLOPs. Large-scale online A/B tests in high-traffic production systems further validate its effectiveness, showing significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models.

Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u70b9\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5360\u7528\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u5360\u7528\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9610\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6df7\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u96be\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u8fa8\u522b\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff08IMPG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7b49\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6539\u8fdb\u96be\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528DAPS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6784\u5efaHSM3K - CN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u96be\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3IMPG\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002"}}

Objective: This paper aims to consolidate existing research on technical lag, clarify definitions, explore its detection and quantification methods, examine underlying causes and consequences, review current management practices, and lay out a vision as an indicator of passively accumulated technical debt. Method: We conducted a Rapid Review with snowballing to select the appropriate peer-reviewed studies. We leveraged the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Springer as our primary source databases. Results: Technical lag accumulates passively, often unnoticed due to inadequate detection metrics and tools. It negatively impacts software quality through outdated dependencies, obsolete APIs, unsupported platforms, and aging infrastructure. Strategies to manage technical lag primarily involve automated dependency updates, continuous integration processes, and regular auditing. Conclusions: Enhancing and extending the current standardized metrics, detection methods, and empirical studies to use technical lag as an indication of accumulated latent debt can greatly improve the process of maintaining large codebases that are heavily dependent on external packages.

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes.

This study examines whether AI skills serve as a positive hiring signal and whether they can offset conventional disadvantages such as older age or lower formal education. We conduct an experimental survey with 1,700 recruiters from the United Kingdom and the United States. Using a paired conjoint design, recruiters evaluated hypothetical candidates represented by synthetically designed resumes. Across three occupations - graphic designer, office assistant, and software engineer - AI skills significantly increase interview invitation probabilities by approximately 8 to 15 percentage points. AI skills also partially or fully offset disadvantages related to age and lower education, with effects strongest for office assistants, where formal AI certification plays an additional compensatory role. Effects are weaker for graphic designers, consistent with more skeptical recruiter attitudes toward AI in creative work. Finally, recruiters' own background and AI usage significantly moderate these effects.

When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to \"almost-stable\" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u5927\u539f\u5219\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a33\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u867d\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed9\u51fa\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709'\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a33\u5b9a'\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u805a\u5408\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c11\u6570\u4e2a\u4f53\u627f\u62c5\u8fc7\u591a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u5927\u539f\u5219\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a33\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f53\u6240\u5904\u7684\u6700\u5927\u963b\u585e\u5bf9\u6570\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u6ca1\u4eba\u5904\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u963b\u585e\u5bf9\u7684\u5339\u914d\u662fNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5ba4\u53cb\u548c\u6700\u5927\u57fa\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u5a5a\u59fb\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f53\u4e2a\u4f53\u6700\u591a\u5bf9\u4e24\u4eba\u6392\u5e8f\u65f6\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u52fe\u52d2\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations. Our framework provides a lightweight, trustworthy pathway to inverse design involving functional responses, expensive simulations, and complex design requirements, beyond metamaterials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5RAG\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u529f\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u529f\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5904\u7406\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u6761\u4ef6\u4f3c\u7136\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1RAG\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u4e3a\u6d89\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6b63\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u7269\u54c1\u4fa7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u8bc4\u7ea7\u8f6c\u6362\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e14\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u72ec\u7acb\u63a2\u8ba8\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6b63\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u7269\u54c1\u4fa7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7684\u8bc4\u7ea7\u8f6c\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7269\u54c1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u653e\u5927\u8fc7\u5ea6\u66dd\u5149\uff1b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u66dd\u5149\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5904\u7406\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u504f\u5dee\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

As a combinatorial optimization model for channel assignment, the radio labeling is recognized as an NP-hard problem. Therefore, converting the spectrum assignment problem into the radio labeling of graphs and studying the radio labeling of specific graph classes is of great significance. For $G$, a radio labeling $\\varphi: V(G) \\to \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is required to satisfy $|\\varphi(u) - \\varphi(v)| \\geq \\text{diam}(G) + 1 -d_G(u, v)$, where ${diam(G)}$ and $d_G(u, v)$ are diameter and distance between $u$ and $v$. For a radio labeling $\\varphi$, its $\\text{span}$ is defined as the largest integer assigned by $\\varphi$ to the vertices of $G$; the radio labeling specifically denotes the labeling with the minimal span among possible radio labeling. The strong product is a crucial tool for constructing regular networks, and studying its radio labeling is necessary for the design of optimal channel assignment in wireless networks.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates.

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning. Thus, we suggest that auditors scope automated evaluation protocols strictly: delegate all deterministically verifiable logic to code, while reserving LLM judges for complex semantic evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f01\u4e1a\u6cbb\u7406\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u88c1\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u8106\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4eba\u5458\u4e25\u683c\u89c4\u5212\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u884c\u4e1a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f01\u4e1a\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff0cLLM - as - a - Judge\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u672a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u88ab\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8303\u56f4\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u88ab\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u4e3a\u5ba2\u89c2\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027HR GenAI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u8bc4\u5224\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u201c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9677\u9631\u201d\uff0c\u88c1\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u88c1\u51b3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u88c1\u51b3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u8106\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u903b\u8f91\u4ea4\u7ed9\u4ee3\u7801\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime.

We address the crucial question of how to optimally allocate a fixed annotation budget between ground-truth labels and pairwise preferences in AI. Our solution, grounded in semi-parametric inference, casts the budget allocation problem as a monotone missing data framework. Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution.

Disagreement evolves substantially: radiologists initially reject AI-positive PEs in 30% of cases, dropping to 12% by year two. Despite a 16% increase in scan volume, diagnostic speed remains stable while per-radiologist monthly volumes nearly double, with no change in patient mortality -- suggesting AI improves workflow without compromising outcomes. We document significant heterogeneity in AI collaboration: some radiologists reject AI-flagged PEs half the time while others accept nearly always; female radiologists are 6 percentage points less likely to override AI than male radiologists.

Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\u5e76\u53d1\u968f\u673a\u535a\u5f08\uff08CSGs\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u7c7b\u533a\u95f4 CSGs\uff08ICSGs\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728 PRISM - games \u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf CSGs \u6a21\u578b\u8981\u6c42\u7cbe\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u8651\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u4e0e\u975e\u96f6\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u53d1\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728 PRISM - games \u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u660e ICSGs \u9c81\u68d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2 CSGs \u548c ICSGs \u4ee5\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5904\u7406 CSGs \u4e2d\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

It has been used for various tasks such as retrieving similar items in high-dimensional images or text data. In retrieval applications, however, the Wasserstein distance is calculated repeatedly, and its cubic time complexity with respect to input size renders it unsuitable for large-scale datasets. Recently, tree-based approximation methods have been proposed to address this bottleneck. For example, the Flowtree algorithm computes transport on a quadtree and evaluates cost using the ground metric, and clustering-tree approaches have been reported to achieve high accuracy. However, these existing trees often incur significant construction time for preprocessing, and crucially, standard quadtrees cannot grow deep enough in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in poor approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose kd-Flowtree, a kd-tree-based Wasserstein distance approximation method that uses a kd-tree for data embedding. Since kd-trees can grow sufficiently deep and adaptively even in high-dimensional cases, kd-Flowtree is capable of maintaining good approximation accuracy for such cases. In addition, kd-trees can be constructed quickly than quadtrees, which contributes to reducing the computation time required for nearest neighbor search, including preprocessing. We provide a probabilistic upper bound on the nearest-neighbor search accuracy of kd-Flowtree, and show that this bound is independent of the dataset size. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrated that kd-Flowtree outperformed the existing Wasserstein distance approximation methods for retrieval tasks with real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ekd - tree\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5kd - Flowtree\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6811\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fakd - Flowtree\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528kd - tree\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ekd - Flowtree\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "kd - Flowtree\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6784\u5efa\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

This study addresses a critical literature gap by comparatively testing three conditional volatility models the EWMA/IGARCH baseline, an IGARCH model augmented with explicit mean reversion (IGARCH + MR), and a modified EGARCH-style asymmetric shock model within a correlated Monte Carlo VaR framework. Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6807\u51c6\u9759\u6001GBM\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d1d\u5854\u5c71\u5be8\u5e01\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EWMA/IGARCH\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u9759\u6001GBM\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41GARCH\u6587\u732e\u5f88\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u8d1d\u5854\u5c71\u5be8\u5e01\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57VaR\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5EWMA/IGARCH\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001IGARCH + MR\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u7684EGARCH\u98ce\u683c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u51b2\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "IGARCH + MR\u4e25\u91cd\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e0b\u884c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0cEWMA/IGARCH\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d2\u7edd\u5c71\u5be8\u5e01\u8d44\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u5747\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6760\u6746\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ea7\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

At the same time, current LLMs still struggle to fully interpret complex and multifaceted tasks. To address this gap, we argue for a stronger task-based perspective on query intent.

We prove that the sets of linearizable objects satisfying wait-freedom (resp., lock-freedom or obstruction-freedom) form a bounded join-semilattice under the forward simulation relation, and that the sets of linearizable objects without liveness constraints form a bounded lattice under the same relation. As part of our lattice result, we propose an equivalent characterization of linearizability by reducing checking linearizability w.r.t. sequential specification $Spec$ into checking forward simulation by an object $\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$. To demonstrate the forward simulation relation between linearizable objects, we prove that the objects that are strongly linearizable w.r.t. the same sequential specification and are wait-free (resp., lock-free, obstruction-free) simulate each other, and we prove that the time-stamped queue simulates the Herlihy-Wing queue. We also prove that the Herlihy-Wing queue is simulated by $\\mathcal{U}_{Spec}$, and thus, our equivalent characterization of linearizability can be used in the verification of linearizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u8be5\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u523b\u753b\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65e0\u6d3b\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5728\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b49\u4ef7\u523b\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u754c\u534a\u683c\u6216\u6709\u754c\u683c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5bf9\u8c61\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u961f\u5217\u6a21\u62dfHerlihy - Wing\u961f\u5217\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u4ef7\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Yet most neuromorphic and photonic systems still digitize events into timestamps, bins, or rates and then perform selection in clocked logic. We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch. PWC provides a fast routing coprocessor for LUT-style spiking networks and sparse top-1 gates (e.g., mixture-of-experts routing) across polaritonic, photonic, and oscillator platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u5740\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u540e\u5728\u65f6\u949f\u903b\u8f91\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6ce2\u57df\u5c06\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c16\u5cf0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u79bb\u6563\u8f93\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5c16\u5cf0\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u591a\u7aef\u53e3\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5e76\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30K\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7531\u9a71\u52a8 - \u8017\u6563\u8d62\u5bb6\u901a\u5403\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406argmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bfb\u53d6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8def\u7531\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\u76f8\u4f4d\u8c03\u8c10\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u95e8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PWC\u4e3a\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u5f0f\u8109\u51b2\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7a00\u758ftop - 1\u95e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u8def\u7531\u534f\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

A planner proposes structurally diverse, type checked directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a rubric guided reasoning module selects a single compliant plan, and execution is guarded by validator gated checks, a bounded repair loop, and compiled policy guardrails that block or route side effects before they occur.

In this quasi-longitudinal study, we analyze five years of student source code submissions in a graduate-level cloud computing course, focusing on an assignment that remained unchanged and examining students' behavior during the period spanning five semesters before the release of ChatGPT and five semesters after.\n  Student coding behavior has changed significantly since Fall 2022.

Between consecutive submissions, average edit distances increased while average score improvement decreased, suggesting that both student productivity and learning have decreased after ChatGPT's release.

Thus, patients require lifelong insulin therapy, which has a side effect of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a critical state of decreased blood glucose levels (BGL) below 70 mg/dL and is associated with increased risk of mortality. Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D. We compare the models' performance across short-term (15 to 120 min) and long term (3 to more than 24 hours) prediction horizons (PHs).

We formalize this mechanism through a limit-viability criterion, and model opacity as a strategic choice of the information structure via Blackwell garbling.

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa xBound \u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 xBound \u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728 JOBlight \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c Microsoft \u4f01\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0cxBound \u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 DuckDB\u3001PostgreSQL \u548c Fabric Data Warehouse \u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "xBound \u6846\u67b6\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, the resulting exponential growth in computation workload is placing significant strain on data centers, while edge devices remain largely underutilized, leading to imbalanced workloads and resource inefficiency across the network. Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler. These components collaboratively enhance drafting efficiency and optimize verification request scheduling on the server. Extensive numerical results show that WISP improves system capacity by up to 2.1x and 4.1x, and increases system goodput by up to 1.94x and 3.7x, compared to centralized serving and SLED, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfWISP\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u538b\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u5f0fLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6279\u5904\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7684WISP\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u548cSLED\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cWISP\u5206\u522b\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad82.1\u500d\u548c4.1\u500d\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.94\u500d\u548c3.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "WISP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4b\u5f0fLLM\u670d\u52a1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Automated PICOS compliance and study design classification from titles and abstracts were performed using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory baseline and a transformer-based multi-task classifier fine-tuned from PubMedBERT. Full-text synthesis employed retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid vector and graph retrieval, while BERTopic was used to identify thematic structure, redundancy, and evidence gaps. The transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy for study design classification with strong agreement against expert annotations, while the Bi-LSTM achieved 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance detection. Retrieval-augmented generation outperformed non-retrieval generation for queries requiring structured constraints, cross-study integration, and graph-based reasoning, whereas non-retrieval approaches remained competitive for high-level summaries. Topic modeling revealed substantial thematic redundancy and identified underexplored research areas. These results demonstrate that PICOS-aware and explainable natural language processing can improve the scalability, transparency, and efficiency of evidence synthesis.

We present OmniLink, a new methodology for validating concurrent implementations against high-level specifications in TLA+. Unlike prior TLA+ based approaches which use a technique called trace validation, OmniLink treats system events as black boxes with a timebox in which they occurred and a meaning in TLA+, solving for a logical total order of actions. Unlike prior approaches based on linearizability checking, which already solves for total orders of actions with timeboxes, OmniLink uses a flexible specification language, and offers a different linearizability checking method based on off-the-shelf model checking. OmniLink offers different features compared existing linearizability checking tools, and we show that it outperforms the state of the art on large scale validation tasks.\n  Our evaluation validates WiredTiger, a state-of-the-art industrial database storage layer, as well as Balanced Augmented Tree (BAT), a state-of-the art lock-free data structure from the research community, and ConcurrentQueue, a popular lock-free queue featuring aggressive performance optimizations.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ccJacobian - PCA\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u8def\u7531\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76MoE\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ccJacobian - PCA\u8c31\u51e0\u4f55\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Jacobian\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u52a0\u6743PCA\u5206\u6790\u8868\u793a\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u7684MLP - MoE\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "MoE\u8def\u7531\u964d\u4f4e\u5c40\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6Jacobian\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0cTop - k\u8def\u7531\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5168\u8f6f\u8def\u7531\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3001\u9ad8\u79e9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u652f\u6301\u5c06MoE\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5dee\u3002"}}

Although Q-learning is a widely used model-free algorithm with established sample complexity in discounted and finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), its theoretical guarantees for average-reward settings remain limited. This work studies a simple but effective Q-learning algorithm for average-reward MDPs with finite state and action spaces under the weakly communicating assumption, covering both single-agent and federated scenarios. For the single-agent case, we show that Q-learning with carefully chosen parameters achieves sample complexity $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|\\|h^{\\star}\\|_{\\mathsf{sp}}^3}{\\varepsilon^3}\\right)$, where $\\|h^{\\star}\\|_{\\mathsf{sp}}$ is the span norm of the bias function, improving previous results by at least a factor of $\\frac{\\|h^{\\star}\\|_{\\mathsf{sp}}^2}{\\varepsilon^2}$.

The game is played on a graph having a subset of vertices labeled as exits and the goal of one of the two players, called the fugitive, is to reach one of these exit vertices. The second player, i.e. the fugitive adversary, is called the Nemesis. Her goal is to trap the fugitive in a connected component which does not contain any exit. At each round of the game, the fugitive moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. Then the Nemesis deletes one edge anywhere in the graph. The game ends when either the fugitive reached an exit or when he is in a connected component that does not contain any exit. In trees and graphs of maximum degree bounded by 3, Nemesis can be solved in linear time. We also show that a variant of the game called Blizzard where only edges adjacent to the position of the fugitive can be deleted also admits a linear time solution. For arbitrary graphs, we show that Nemesis is PSPACE-complete, and that it is NP-hard on planar multigraphs. We extend our results to the related Cat Herding problem, proving its PSPACE-completeness.

However, the AIS data needs to be cleaned, processed, and stored before being usable. This paper presents a system consisting of an efficient and modular ETL process for loading AIS data, as well as a distributed spatial data warehouse storing the trajectories of ships. To efficiently analyze a large set of ships, a raster approach to querying the AIS data is proposed. A spatially partitioned data warehouse with a granularized cell representation and heatmap presentation is designed, developed, and evaluated.

In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted.

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation. (2) a parallel execution scheme of neuron group loading during the model inference. (3) a load-balancing scheduler that efficiently orchestrates multiple devices with heterogeneous resources. Experimental results from a Raspberry Pi cluster demonstrate that HALO achieves a 3.41x end-to-end speedup for LLaMA-series LLMs under unreliable network conditions. It maintains performance comparable to optimal conditions and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHALO\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u635f\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u52a0\u901f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHALO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ec4\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u8f7d\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6811\u8393\u6d3e\u96c6\u7fa4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHALO\u5bf9LLaMA\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b03.41\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HALO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5728\u6709\u635f\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench.

Unlike prior approaches that use formal methods primarily to validate LLM outputs, CodeLogician uses LLMs to construct explicit formal models of software systems, enabling automated reasoning to answer rich semantic questions beyond binary verification outcomes.\n  To rigorously evaluate mathematical reasoning about software logic, we introduce code-logic-bench, a benchmark targeting the middle ground between theorem proving and software engineering benchmarks. It measures reasoning correctness about program state spaces, control flow, coverage constraints, and edge cases, with ground truth defined via formal modeling and region decomposition.\n  Comparing LLM-only reasoning against LLMs augmented with CodeLogician, formal augmentation yields substantial improvements, closing a 41-47 percentage point gap in reasoning accuracy.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

However, existing frameworks typically require explicit data export and extensive feature engineering, creating a high barrier for database practitioners. We present TLSQL (Table Learning Structured Query Language), a system that enables table learning directly over relational databases via SQL-like declarative specifications. TLSQL is implemented as a lightweight Python library that translates these specifications into standard SQL queries and structured learning task descriptions. The generated SQL queries are executed natively by the database engine, while the task descriptions are consumed by downstream table learning frameworks.

A hybrid batch combines prefill and decode tokens of different requests in the same batch to improve resource utilization and throughput at the cost of increased latency per token. In contrast, disaggregated serving decouples compute-bound prefill and bandwidth-bound decode phases to optimize for service level objectives (SLOs) at the cost of resource under-utilization and KV-cache transfer overheads. To address the limitations of these techniques, we propose RAPID-Serve: a technique to concurrently execute prefill and decode on the same GPU(s) to meet latency SLOs while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Resource Management for runtime compute resource allocation, optionally leveraging CU masking (a fine-grained Compute Unit partitioning feature on AMD Instinct\\textsuperscript{TM} GPUs).

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution.

As the models grow gigantic in terms of memory footprint, difficulties in fitting the model on a device like a GPU or an AI accelerator give rise to the need for multiple computing devices thereby escalating the computing cost. This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance. While maintaining the memory gains of Symmetric Attention, with minute overhead in terms of model parameters and computational overhead, the proposed model brings in enhanced performance in terms of accuracy and inference-time sampling. The proposed model is validated upon GPT2 base model and the results reflect the performance gains falling between plain Symmetric attention and GPT2 base model on a variety of GLUE benchmark tasks in terms of accuracy, with significant model size reduction with respect to the base model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u79f0\u70b9\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cdGLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cGPT2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5934\uff1bD - Linear\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cTweedie\u5206\u5e03\u5934\u5728\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5e93\u5b58\u4e2d\u5360\u6bd4\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\uff08iETS\u3001TweedieGP\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\uff08D - Linear\u3001DeepAR\u3001Transformers\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8003\u8651\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5934\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u542b\u8d8540000\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dD - Linear \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\uff0cTransformers\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f4e\uff1bTweedie\u5206\u5e03\u5934\u5bf9\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u5e03\u5934\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "D - Linear\u9002\u5408\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bTweedie\u5206\u5e03\u5934\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u65f6\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8d1f\u4e8c\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u5e03\u5934\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

The celebrated Vizing's theorem [Viz64] states that every simple graph $G = (V,E)$ can be properly $(\u0394+1)$-edge-colored. In a seminal paper, Karloff and Shmoys [KS87] devised a parallel algorithm with time $O\\left(\u0394^5\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\left(\\log^3 n+\u0394^2\\right)\\right)$ and $O(m\\cdot\u0394)$ processors. This result was improved by Liang et al. [LSH96] to time $O\\left(\u0394^{4.5}\\cdot \\log^3\u0394\\cdot \\log n + \u0394^4 \\cdot\\log^4 n\\right)$ and $O\\left(n\\cdot\u0394^{3} +n^2\\right)$ processors. [LSH96] claimed $O\\left(\u0394^{3.5} \\cdot\\log^3\u0394\\cdot \\log n + \u0394^3\\cdot \\log^4 n\\right)$ time, but we point out a flaw in their analysis, which once corrected, results in the above bound. We devise a faster parallel algorithm for this fundamental problem. Specifically, our algorithm uses $O\\left(\u0394^4\\cdot \\log^4 n\\right)$ time and $O(m\\cdot \u0394)$ processors. Another variant of our algorithm requires $O\\left(\u0394^{4+o(1)}\\cdot\\log^2 n\\right)$ time, and $O\\left(m\\cdot\u0394\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\log^\u03b4\u0394\\right)$ processors, for an arbitrarily small $\u03b4>0$.

To more accurately infer user preferences from multi-turn conversations, recent works increasingly expand conversational context (e.g., by incorporating diverse entity information or retrieving related dialogues). While such context enrichment can assist preference modeling, it also introduces longer and more heterogeneous inputs, leading to practical issues such as input length constraints, text style inconsistency, and irrelevant textual noise, thereby raising the demand for stronger language understanding ability. In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning. We design a knowledge-anchored fusion framework that combines contrastive alignment, cross-attention interaction, and adaptive gating to integrate the two modes for improved preference modeling and response generation.

In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results. Our findings are demonstrated through the application of this approach to the generation of fuzz targets for C/C++ libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5e93\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728C/C++\u5e93\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u548c\u5e93\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u6267\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5e93\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u5efa\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u6620\u5c04\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5408\u6210\u7f16\u8bd1\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6536\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eC/C++\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5e93\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u7cca\u76ee\u6807\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316PINN\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548cPINN\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e25\u683c\u91cf\u5316PINN\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u5916\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f$g_F^C$\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684PINN\u7684$g_F^C$\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86PINN\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82e5PINN\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f97\u5230\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u666f\u89c2\u5e94\u4e0e\u539f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740PINN\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, \"FLAML\", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated.

As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters. We have integrated DaggerFFT into Oceananigans.jl, a geophysical fluid dynamics framework, demonstrating that high-level, task-based runtimes can deliver both superior performance and modularity in large-scale, real-world simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u6846\u67b6DaggerFFT\uff0c treating FFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\uff0c\u53ef\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u540e\u7aef\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5e93\uff0c\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210\u5230Oceananigans.jl\u5c55\u793a\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7528Julia\u5f00\u53d1DaggerFFT\uff0c\u5c06FFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\uff0cFFT\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u4e3aDTasks\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7528Dagger\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "DaggerFFT\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u540e\u7aef\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFFT\u5e93\uff0cCPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u8fbe2.6x\uff0cGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u8fbe1.35x\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3002"}}

However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \\texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler.

Stability plays a crucial role in understanding generalization, robustness, and replicability, and a variety of stability notions have been proposed in different learning settings. However, while stability entails desirable properties, it is typically not sufficient on its own for statistical learning -- and indeed, it may be at odds with accuracy, since an algorithm that always outputs a constant function is perfectly stable but statistically meaningless. Thus, it is essential to understand the potential statistical cost of stability. In this work, we address this question by adopting a statistical decision-theoretic perspective, treating stability as a constraint in estimation. Focusing on two representative notions-worst-case stability and average-case stability-we first establish general lower bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy under each type of stability constraint. We then develop optimal stable estimators for four canonical estimation problems, including several mean estimation and regression settings. Together, these results characterize the optimal trade-offs between stability and accuracy across these tasks. Our findings formalize the intuition that average-case stability imposes a qualitatively weaker restriction than worst-case stability, and they further reveal that the gap between these two can vary substantially across different estimation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u867d\u6709\u671f\u671b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6bd4\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u5f31\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5dee\u8ddd\u56e0\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e24\u8005\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + \u03b1)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(\u03b1^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + \u03b1)$ approximation in amortized $O(\u03b1^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$. In our experiments we find almost-optimal splits efficiently, faster than the baseline, overperforming the theoretical approximation guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $\u03b1$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$\u03b1$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm.

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks.

While scaling model size addresses complexity in broader AI, this approach yields diminishing returns for physics modeling. Drawing inspiration from Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian (HLE) numerical methods, we introduce deformable physics-aware recurrent convolutions (D-PARC) to overcome the rigidity of CNNs. Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics.

While predictive, these tools typically treat risk as a static, individual attribute, which overlooks how risk evolves over time and how treatment decisions shape outcomes through social interactions. In this paper, we develop a new framework that models reoffending risk as a human-system interaction, linking individual behavior with system-level dynamics and endogenous community feedback. Using an agent-based simulation calibrated to U.S. probation data, we evaluate treatment allocation policies under different capacity constraints and incarceration settings. Our results show that no single prioritization policy dominates. Instead, policy effectiveness depends on temporal windows and system parameters: prioritizing low-risk individuals performs better when long-term trajectories matter, while prioritizing high-risk individuals becomes more effective in the short term or when incarceration leads to shorter monitoring periods.

Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method.

Through fine-grained trajectory analysis, we identify Thinking Traps, prefix-dominant deadlocks where later reflection, alternative attempts, or verification fails to revise the root error. On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51faLong - CoT\u867d\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u4f1a\u6709\u601d\u7ef4\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTAAR\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "Long - CoT\u6269\u5c55\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u622a\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u542f\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u9677\u9631\u60c5\u51b5\u65bd\u52a0\u66f4\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTAAR\u5728\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TAAR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3Long - CoT\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe.

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models.

The transmission of disease from animals to humans occurs at the interface between humans, livestock, and wildlife reservoirs, influenced by abiotic factors and ecological mechanisms. Although evidence suggests that intact ecosystems can reduce transmission, disease prevention has largely been neglected in conservation efforts and remains underfunded compared to mitigation. A major constraint is the lack of reliable, spatially explicit information to guide efforts effectively. Given the increasing rate of new disease emergence, accelerated by climate change and biodiversity loss, identifying priority areas for mitigating the risk of disease transmission is more crucial than ever. We present new high-resolution (1 km) maps of priority areas for targeted ecological countermeasures aimed at reducing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover, along with a methodology adaptable to local contexts. Our study compiles data on well-documented risk factors, protection status, forest restoration potential, and opportunity cost of the land to map areas with high potential for cost-effective interventions. We identify low-cost priority areas across 50 countries, including 277,000 km2 where environmental restoration could mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover and 198,000 km2 where preventing deforestation could do the same, 95% of which are not currently under protection. The resulting layers, covering tropical regions globally, are freely available alongside an interactive no-code platform that allows users to adjust parameters and identify priority areas at multiple scales.

Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a \"diverge-then-converge\" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics.

These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\\times$ on throughput.

Existing self-improving frameworks attempt to bridge this gap but typically rely on inefficient, multi-turn recursive loops that incur high computational costs. To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MARS outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving systems while significantly reducing computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMARS\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d7\u9759\u6001\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u9650\u5236\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5c06\u89c1\u89e3\u5408\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMARS\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "conclusion": "MARS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898"}}

We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each.

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon.

We show that the causal effect of an aggregate treatment is generally ambiguous, as it depends on how interventions on the aggregate are instantiated at the component level, formalized through the aggregate-constrained component intervention distribution. We then characterize conditions on the interventional distribution and the aggregate setting under which standard instrumental variable estimators identify the aggregate effect.

We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \\ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases.

More precisely, given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and oracle access to an unknown function $f : V \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the goal is to find a local minimum--a vertex $v$ such that $f(v) \\leq f(u)$ for all $(u,v) \\in E$--using at most $t$ rounds of interaction with the oracle. The query complexity is well understood on grids, but much less is known beyond. This abstract problem captures many optimization tasks, such as finding a local minimum of a loss function during neural network training.\n  For each graph with $n$ vertices, we prove a deterministic upper bound of $O(t n^{1/t} (s\u0394)^{1-1/t})$, where $s$ is the separation number and $\u0394$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We complement this result with a randomized lower bound of $\u03a9(t n^{1/t}-t)$ that holds for any connected graph. We also find that parallel steepest descent with a warm start provides improved bounds for graphs with high separation number and bounded degree.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790t\u8f6e\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u90e8\u5206\u56fe\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u56fe\u4e2d\u4e86\u89e3\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4efb\u610fn\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9\u7684\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5f97\u5230\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a$O(t n^{1/t} (s\u0394)^{1 - 1/t})$\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u4e0b\u754c\u4e3a$\u03a9(t n^{1/t}-t)$\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u9ad8\u5206\u79bb\u6570\u548c\u6709\u754c\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0at\u8f6e\u5185\u5bfb\u627e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Brain Passage Retrieval (BPR) addresses this by directly mapping EEG signals to passage representations without intermediate text translation. However, existing BPR research exclusively uses visual stimuli, leaving critical questions unanswered: Can auditory EEG enable effective retrieval for voice-based interfaces and visually impaired users? Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets. Results demonstrate that auditory EEG consistently outperforms visual EEG, and cross-sensory training with CLS pooling achieves substantial improvements over individual training: 31% in MRR (0.474), 43% in Hit@1 (0.314), and 28% in Hit@10 (0.858). Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces.

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored.

To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs.

However, existing approaches often suffer from low repair success rates or poor understandability of the generated patches. In this study, we construct a framework in which a large language model (LLM) generates code repairs along with a natural language explanation of the applied repairs. To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations.

We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task.

However, deploying such collaboration at scale remains difficult when communication bandwidth is limited and no roadside infrastructure is available. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fully decentralized framework that enables vehicles to self organize into cooperative groups using only vehicle to vehicle communication. The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion. Global scene understanding is then achieved by exchanging compact detection messages across clusters rather than raw sensor data. We design distributed algorithms for both stages that guarantee monotonic improvement of the system wide potential function.

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time method called Incremental Prototype Enhancement Classifier (IPEC), a test-time method that optimizes prototype estimation by leveraging information from previous query samples. IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol.

In this paper, we revisit this problem in an ultra-sparse sampling regime, where each entry of an unknown, $n\\times d$ matrix $M$ (with $n \\ge d$) is observed independently with probability $p = C / d$, for a fixed integer $C \\ge 2$. This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns. When each row contains only $C$ entries -- fewer than the rank of $M$ -- accurate imputation of $M$ is impossible. Instead, we estimate the row span of $M$ or the averaged second-moment matrix $T = M^{\\top} M / n$.\n  The empirical second-moment matrix computed from observed entries exhibits non-random and sparse missingness. We propose an unbiased estimator that normalizes each nonzero entry of the second moment by its observed frequency, followed by gradient descent to impute the missing entries of $T$. The normalization divides a weighted sum of $n$ binomial random variables by the total number of ones. We show that the estimator is unbiased for any $p$ and enjoys low variance. When the row vectors of $M$ are drawn uniformly from a rank-$r$ factor model satisfying an incoherence condition, we prove that if $n \\ge O({d r^5 \u03b5^{-2} C^{-2} \\log d})$, any local minimum of the gradient-descent objective is approximately global and recovers $T$ with error at most $\u03b5^2$.\n  Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data validate our approach.

We also empirically validate the linear sampling complexity of $n$ relative to $d$ on synthetic data.

Project: https://01yzzyu.github.io/xr.github.io/", "summary": "Retrieval is being redefined by agentic AI, demanding multimodal reasoning beyond conventional similarity-based paradigms. Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities. While embedding-based CIR methods have achieved progress, they remain narrow in perspective, capturing limited cross-modal cues and lacking semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering. Through progressive multi-agent coordination, XR iteratively refines retrieval to meet both semantic and visual query constraints, achieving up to a 38% gain over strong training-free and training-based baselines on FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO, while ablations show each agent is essential.

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9TOON\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5e38\u7528\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8f93\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e94\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u6548\u7387\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEnvironment - Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env) \u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684TOON\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0eJSON\u3001XML\u3001YAML\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "TOON\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u6392\u653e\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6539\u53d8\u683c\u5f0f\u6392\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u50cfTOON\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6ce8\u91cd\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

Collaborative perception improves accuracy by mitigating the sensing limitations of individual vehicles, such as limited perception range and occlusion-induced blind spots. However, collaborative perception often suffers from high communication overhead due to redundant data transmission, as well as increasing computation latency caused by excessive load with growing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) participation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel local-to-global collaborative perception framework (LGCP) to achieve collaboration in a communication- and computation-efficient manner. The road of interest is partitioned into non-overlapping areas, each of which is assigned a dedicated CAV group to perform localized perception. A designated leader in each group collects and fuses perception data from its members, and uploads the perception result to the roadside unit (RSU), establishing a link between local perception and global awareness. The RSU aggregates perception results from all groups and broadcasts a global view to all CAVs. LGCP employs a centralized scheduling strategy via the RSU, which assigns CAV groups to each area, schedules their transmissions, aggregates area-level local perception results, and propagates the global view to all CAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LGCP framework achieves an average 44 times reduction in the amount of data transmission, while maintaining or even improving the overall collaborative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6LGCP\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9053\u8def\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2aCAV\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7ec4\u5185\u6307\u5b9a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4e0a\u4f20\u81f3RSU\uff0cRSU\u6c47\u603b\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u5e7f\u64ad\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LGCP\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1144\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LGCP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4ee5\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer.

Under MCAR/strict-MAR at 30\\% missingness, SNI is generally competitive on continuous metrics but is often outperformed by accuracy-first baselines (MissForest, MIWAE) on categorical variables; in return, it provides intrinsic dependency diagnostics and explicit statistical-neural trade-off parameters.

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.\n  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance.

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faARC\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u601d\u9a71\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u88ab\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8150\u70c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u91cd\u70b9\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cARC\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u88ab\u52a8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Qwen2.5 - 32B - Instruct\u5728BrowseComp - ZH\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe11%\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8150\u70c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6ATSADBench\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3001\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u800c\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ATSADBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b9\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5171108,000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff1b\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u5dee\uff1b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u5c0f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum.

This approach significantly advances orbital management by establishing a benchmark for renewable solar propulsion that minimizes reliance on conventional fuels and extends mission longevity for multi-target removal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u4fee\u590d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8f68\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f9d\u8d56\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u79ef\u7d2f\u5a01\u80c1\u592a\u7a7a\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6e05\u9664\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u4fee\u590d\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u68b0\u5939\u7d27\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u52a8\u529bNASA NEXT\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4ece800\u516c\u91cc\u9006\u884c\u8131\u8f68\u5230100\u516c\u91cc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbeEKF\u5bfc\u822a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee<10\u7c73\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DTN\u534f\u8bae1\u79d2\u5185\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u8fbe93%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u8f68\u9053\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u63a8\u8fdb\u6811\u7acb\u6807\u6746\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u71c3\u6599\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u5bff\u547d\u3002"}}

Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation.

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $\u03b7_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($\u03b7_t < \u03b7_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($\u03b7_t > \u03b7_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u7591\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eSGD\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u6b65\u957f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e8c\u6b21\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u754c\u6b65\u957f\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eSGD\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86SGD\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u7591\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Standard methods combine matrix-vector products with polynomial approximations. We study a different model: access to trace powers $p_k = \\tr(A^k)$, natural when matrix powers are available.\n  Classical moment-based approximations Taylor-expand $\\log(\u03bb)$ around the arithmetic mean. This requires $|\u03bb- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $\u03ba> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = \u03bb/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$. Given a spectral floor $r \\leq \u03bb_{\\min}$, we obtain moment-constrained lower bounds, yielding a provable interval for $\\log\\det(A)$.

Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases.

Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties. The architecture employs hierarchical decoder heads for Black Carbon, Gas, and CO$_2$ sensor families, with two variants: PC$^2$DAE-Lean (21k parameters) for edge deployment and PC$^2$DAE-Wide (204k parameters) for offline processing. We evaluate on 7,894 synchronized 1 Hz samples collected from UAV flights during prescribed burns in Saskatchewan, Canada (approximately 2.2 hours of flight data), two orders of magnitude below typical deep learning requirements.

In contrast with optimal transport maps which often have limited applicability in high dimensions, Schrodinger bridges can be solved using the celebrated Sinkhorn's algorithm, a.k.a. the iterative proportional fitting procedure. The stability properties of Sinkhorn bridges when the number of iterations tends to infinity is a very active research area in applied probability and machine learning. Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques. These powerful, off-the-shelf semigroup methods are based upon transportation cost inequalities (e.g. log-Sobolev, Talagrand quadratic inequality, curvature estimates), $\u03c6$-divergences, Kantorovich-type criteria and Dobrushin contraction-type coefficients on weighted Banach spaces as well as Wasserstein distances. This novel semigroup analysis allows one to unify and simplify many arguments in the stability of Sinkhorn algorithm.

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes.

Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSUTRADHARA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5373\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u6e32\u67d3\uff08FTR\uff09\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSUTRADHARA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u62c6\u5206\u3001\u6d41\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5668\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728A100 GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0cSUTRADHARA\u5c06\u4e2d\u4f4dFTR\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e15\uff05\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e10\uff05\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) serves as the de facto standard for describing REST APIs and is crucial for multiple software engineering tasks. However, developers face challenges in writing and maintaining OAS. Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation. By constructing an API dependency graph, it establishes necessary file associations to address LLMs' context limitations. Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference.

Submitted to Operations Research", "summary": "Estimating the unknown reward functions driving agents' behaviors is of central interest in inverse reinforcement learning and game theory. To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions.

However, with the emergence of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), concerns about economic centralization and content manipulation have intensified. To address these vulnerabilities, the Ethereum community has introduced Proposer Builder Separation (PBS), which separates block construction from block proposal. Later, enshrined Proposer Builder Separation (ePBS) was also proposed in EIP-7732, which embeds PBS directly into the Ethereum consensus layer.\n  Our work identifies key limitations of ePBS by developing a formal framework that combines mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations to evaluate its auction-based block-building mechanism, with particular emphasis on MEV dynamics. Our results reveal that, although ePBS redistributes responsibilities between builders and proposers, it significantly amplifies profit and content centralization: the Gini coefficient for profits rises from 0.1749 under standard PoS without ePBS to 0.8358 under ePBS. This sharp increase indicates that a small number of efficient builders capture most value via MEV-driven auctions. Moreover, 95.4% of the block value is rewarded to proposers in ePBS, revealing a strong economic bias despite their limited role in block assembly. These findings highlight that ePBS exacerbates incentives for builders to adopt aggressive MEV strategies, suggesting the need for future research into mechanism designs that better balance decentralization, fairness, and MEV mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30ePBS\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ePBS\u867d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u804c\u8d23\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548cMEV\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728PoS\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cMEV\u5f15\u53d1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u7eb5\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0cePBS\u867d\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30ePBS\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8MEV\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "ePBS\u867d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u804c\u8d23\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u6da6\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u4ece\u65e0ePBS\u65f6\u76840.1749\u5347\u81f30.8358\uff1b95.4%\u7684\u533a\u5757\u4ef7\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed9\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "ePBS\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u8fdbMEV\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548cMEV\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution.

By modeling the base distribution as a learnable, descriptor-dependent mixture, MixFlow enables smooth interpolation and extrapolation to unseen conditions, leading to substantially improved out-of-distribution generalization.

Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts.

Retrieval augmentation provides a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning by conditioning LLMs on user history records, and existing approaches typically select these records based on semantic relevance. We argue that relevance serves as an unreliable proxy for utility: a record may be semantically similar to a query yet fail to improve generation quality or even degrade it due to redundancy or conflicting information. To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies. By training with dense feedback provided by the likelihood of the reference response, our method aligns retrieval directly with generation quality.

One approach is to completely abandon the concept of CPU -- and thus serial imperative programming -- and instead to specify and execute tasks in parallel, compiling from programming languages to data flow digital logic. It is well-known that pure functional languages are inherently parallel, due to the Church-Rosser theorem, and CPU-based parallel compilers exist for many functional languages. However, these still rely on conventional CPUs and their von Neumann bottlenecks. An alternative is to compile functional languages directly into digital logic to maximize available parallelism. It is difficult to work with complete modern functional languages due to their many features, so we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system using lambda calculus as the source language and compiling to digital logic. We show how functional hardware can be tailored to a simplistic functional language, forming the ground for a new model of CPU-less functional computation. At the algorithmic level, we use a tree-based representation, with data localized within nodes and communicated data passed between them. This is implemented by physical digital logic blocks corresponding to nodes, and buses enabling message passing. Node types and behaviors correspond to lambda grammar forms, and beta-reductions are performed in parallel allowing branches independent from one another to perform transformations simultaneously. As evidence for this approach, we present an implementation, along with simulation results, showcasing successful execution of lambda expressions.

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency.

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\uff08AGGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u53ef\u8f7b\u91cf\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u8303\u6570\u88c1\u526a\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u6ea2\u51fa\u201d\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9884\u8bbe\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u68af\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u6027\u6709\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u514b\u670d\u68af\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u6309\u529f\u80fd\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u7528\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\uff08EMA\uff09\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAGGC \u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e LoRA \u548c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5728 GSM8K \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAGGC \u5fae\u8c03\u7684 Mistral - 7B \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85 LoRA\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a RLVR\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AGGC \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning.

This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions.

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives.

This issue arises frequently in traditional in-processing approaches such as fairness-through-regularization. In contrast, existing Pareto-efficient approaches are biased towards a certain perspective on fairness and fail to adapt to the broad range of fairness metrics studied in the literature. In this paper, we present BADR, a simple framework to recover the optimal Pareto-efficient model for any fairness metric. Our framework recovers its models through a Bilevel Adaptive Rescalarisation procedure. The lower level is a weighted empirical risk minimization task where the weights are a convex combination of the groups, while the upper level optimizes the chosen fairness objective. We equip our framework with two novel large-scale, single-loop algorithms, BADR-GD and BADR-SGD, and establish their convergence guarantees. We release badr, an open-source Python toolbox implementing our framework for a variety of learning tasks and fairness metrics.

However, these benchmarks often have limitations. Many rely on static or outdated datasets that fail to capture the dynamic, context-rich, and high-stakes nature of biomedical knowledge. They also carry increasing risk of data leakage due to overlap with model pretraining corpora and often overlook critical dimensions such as robustness to linguistic variation and potential demographic biases.\n  Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we introduce BioPulse-QA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on answering questions from newly published biomedical documents including drug labels, trial protocols, and clinical guidelines. BioPulse-QA includes 2,280 expert-verified question answering (QA) pairs and perturbed variants, covering both extractive and abstractive formats. We evaluate four LLMs - GPT-4o, GPT-o1, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct - released prior to the publication dates of the benchmark documents.\n  Results: GPT-o1 achieves the highest relaxed F1 score (0.92), followed by Gemini-2.0-Flash (0.90) on drug labels. Clinical trials are the most challenging source, with extractive F1 scores as low as 0.36.\n  Discussion and Conclusion: Performance differences are larger for paraphrasing than for typographical errors, while bias testing shows negligible differences.

Kim"], "title": "Improving Large Molecular Language Model via Relation-aware Multimodal Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their instruction-following capabilities and achieved powerful performance on various tasks. Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoLLaMo\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoLLaMo\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u591a\u7ea7\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5206\u5b50\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "CoLLaMo\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CoLLaMo\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The cross-file dependencies of these fragments make it difficult for even powerful large language models (LLMs) to detect them reliably. We propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and through backtracking of its predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs.

The traditional k-center problem, a fundamental theoretical challenge in clustering, has a best possible approximation ratio of 2, and any improvement to a ratio of 2 - \u03b5 would imply P = NP. In this work, we study the constrained k-center clustering problem, where instance-level cannot-link (CL) and must-link (ML) constraints are incorporated as background knowledge. Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question. To this end, we propose a novel local search framework based on a transformation to a dominating matching set problem, achieving the best possible approximation ratio of 2.

However, the underlying mechanisms of Muon -- particularly the role of gradient orthogonalization -- remain poorly understood, with very few works providing end-to-end analyses that rigorously explain its advantages in concrete applications. We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior.

The paper describes the architecture and core components of CODECO, outlines representative orchestration workflows, and introduces a software-based experimentation framework for reproducible evaluation in federated Edge-Cloud infrastructure environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCODECO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eKubernetes\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee5\u4e91\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e-\u8ba1\u7b97-\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u6392\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u548cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6269\u5c55Kubernetes\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86CODECO\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7f16\u6392\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "CODECO\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u653e\u7f6e\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_\u03c1$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_\u03c1$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_\u03c1$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern.

We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications.

Code and data available at: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2026-core-t", "summary": "Realistic text-to-SQL workflows often require joining multiple tables. As a result, accurately retrieving the relevant set of tables becomes a key bottleneck for end-to-end performance. We study an open-book setting where queries must be answered over large, heterogeneous table collections pooled from many sources, without clean scoping signals such as database identifiers. Here, dense retrieval (DR) achieves high recall but returns many distractors, while join-aware alternatives often rely on extra assumptions and/or incur high inference overhead. We propose CORE-T, a scalable, training-free framework that enriches tables with LLM-generated purpose metadata and pre-computes a lightweight table-compatibility cache. At inference time, DR returns top-K candidates; a single LLM call selects a coherent, joinable subset, and a simple additive adjustment step restores strongly compatible tables. Across Bird, Spider, and MMQA, CORE-T improves table-selection F1 by up to 22.7 points while retrieving up to 42% fewer tables, improving multi-table execution accuracy by up to 5.0 points on Bird and 6.9 points on MMQA, and using 4-5x fewer tokens than LLM-intensive baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCORE - T\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347F1\u503c\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u8868\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5e38\u9700\u591a\u8868\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u96c6\u662f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCORE - T\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8868\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6DR\u8fd4\u56de\u5019\u9009\uff0cLLM\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u8fde\u63a5\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u52a0\u6cd5\u8c03\u6574\u6b65\u9aa4\u6062\u590d\u5f3a\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bird\u3001Spider\u548cMMQA\u4e0a\uff0cCORE - T\u5c06\u8868\u9009\u62e9F1\u503c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u591a22.7\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a42%\u7684\u8868\u68c0\u7d22\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Bird\u548cMMQA\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8868\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a5.0\u548c6.9\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4LLM\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c11\u75284 - 5\u500d\u7684token\u3002", "conclusion": "CORE - T\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u8868\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

This article presents a detailed analysis focused on quantifying and improving HPC resource utilization efficiency specifically within the LAGO computational environment. The core objective is to understand how LAGO's distinct computational workloads-characterized by a prevalent coarse-grained, task-parallel execution model-consume resources in practice. To achieve this, we analyze historical job accounting data from the EGI FedCloud platform, identifying primary workload categories (Monte Carlo simulations, data processing, user analysis/testing) and evaluating their performance using key efficiency metrics (CPU utilization, walltime utilization, and I/O patterns). Our analysis reveals significant patterns, including high CPU efficiency within individual simulation tasks contrasted with the distorting impact of short test jobs on aggregate metrics. This work pinpoints specific inefficiencies and provides data-driven insights into LAGO's HPC usage.

This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDocs2Synth\u5408\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u8ddf\u4e0a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u9ad8\u989d\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Docs2Synth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u6863\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6837QA\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4e0eMLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u7d22-\u751f\u6210\u5faa\u73af\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVRDU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDocs2Synth\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "Docs2Synth\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5Python\u5305\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures.

We present the RASC (Request-Acknowledge-Start-Complete) abstraction, which provides acknowledgments at critical points after an IoT device action is initiated. RASC is a better fit for IoT actions, which naturally vary in length spatially (across devices) and temporally (across time, for a given device). RASC also enables the design of several new features: predicting action completion times accurately, detecting failures of actions faster, allowing fine-grained dependencies in programming, and scheduling. RASC is intended to be implemented atop today's available RPC mechanisms, rather than as a replacement. We integrated RASC into a popular and open-source IoT framework called Home Assistant. Our trace-driven evaluation finds that RASC meets latency SLOs, especially for long actions that last O(mins), which are common in smart spaces.

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bSOM\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u53cd\u6f14\u6062\u590d\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MUSIC\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u91c7\u6837\u7b49\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6620\u5c04\uff08SOM\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53cd\u6f14\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u51e0\u4f55\u7ecf\u5178\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MUSIC\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "MUSIC\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eSOM\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6f5c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%.

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u73af\u5883\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5224\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ec5\u7531\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4ecb\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u5019\u9009\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u751f\u5b58\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u53d1\u5c55\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MeltRTL, a novel framework that integrates multi-expert attention with inference-time intervention (ITI) to significantly improve LLM-based RTL code generation accuracy without retraining the base model. MeltRTL introduces three key innovations: (1) A multi-expert attention architecture that dynamically routes design specifications to specialized expert networks, enabling targeted reasoning across various hardware categories; (2) An inference-time intervention mechanism that employs non-linear probes to detect and correct hardware-specific inaccuracies during generation; and (3) An efficient intervention framework that selectively operates on expert-specific attention heads with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate MeltRTL on the VerilogEval benchmark, achieving 96% synthesizability and 60% functional correctness, compared to the base LLM's 85.3% and 45.3%, respectively. These improvements are obtained entirely at inference time, with only 27% computational overhead and no model fine-tuning, making MeltRTL immediately deployable on existing pre-trained LLMs. Ablation studies further show the complementary benefits of multi-expert architecture and ITI, highlighting their synergistic effects when combined.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeltRTL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u786c\u4ef6\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u4f20\u8f93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b57\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u51fa\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u51c6 \u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeltRTL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728VerilogEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMeltRTL\u7efc\u5408\u7387\u8fbe96%\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8fbe60%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f27%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "MeltRTL\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\u0393$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\u03c6$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\u0393$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\u0393$ to $N\u0393$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\u0393)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $\u03a9(\u0393)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $\u0393=\u0398(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $\u03bd$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $\u0393$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6709\u9650\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0b\u5e26\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6709\u9650\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u534f\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u56e2\u961f\u540e\u6094\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1 - \u5e72\u6270\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u540e\u6094\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e72\u6270\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u6270\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u5171\u4eab\u6709N\u500d\u66f4\u5927\u9644\u52a0\u5e72\u6270\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4ec5\u63a8\u8350\u5171\u4eab\u4fdd\u6301O(\u0393)\u9879\uff1b\u786e\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u03a9(\u0393)\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u9ad8\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u65e0\u5e72\u51c0\u4fe1\u606f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u540e\u6094\uff1b\u523b\u753b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c2\u5bdf\u9884\u7b97\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u9ad8\u5e72\u6270\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u8bc6\u522b\u9608\u503c\u540e\u662f\u5145\u5206\u7684\uff0c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u540e\u6094\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u65e0\u5173\u3002"}}

Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks.

To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets.

Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes.

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faARK\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u4eff\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5e7f\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u6d45\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u904d\u5386\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79cd\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u8de8\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ARK\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u8bcd\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5355\u8df3\u90bb\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728STaRK\u4e0a\uff0cARK\u5e73\u5747Hit@1\u8fbe\u523059.1%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MRR\u8fbe\u523067.4\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u65e0\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Hit@1\u3002", "conclusion": "ARK\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u4eff\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following.

In this work, we derive and evaluate development-specific prompt optimization guidelines. First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines.

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQAM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5cRL\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TD backup\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebfRL\u786c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316Q\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6216\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u957f\u671f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f34\u968f\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65e0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u9010\u9636\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u5907\u4efd\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "QAM\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebfRL\u7684\u786c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "QAM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5cRL\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity.

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDDGPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u4e00\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDGPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance.

Unlike datacenter GPUs, consumer GPUs serve single-user, rapidly changing workloads, and each model's working set often nearly fills the GPU memory.

To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\u0113Chat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool. Our findings show that GPT-4o generally produces behavior-preserving refactorings that reduce code smells and improve quality metrics, albeit at the cost of decreased readability.

However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks.

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation.

The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of \"who does what\" and \"how much it matters,\" while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not \"force\" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most. We evaluate SEER on PyDesignNet (1,832 files, 35,000 sequences, 23 GoF patterns) and observe consistent gains over our previous system: macro-F1 increases from 92.47% to 93.20% and accuracy from 92.52% to 93.98%, with macro-precision 93.98% and macro-recall 92.52%.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5ffd\u7565\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEVO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6781\u7aef\u4f18\u5148\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "result": "EVO\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "EVO\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Blockchain-based solutions offer decentralized alternatives but often struggle to meet the stringent latency requirements of real-time applications. Even with the rollout of 5G, network latency between servers and peers remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SWORD, a novel offline-first authentication and data-sharing scheme designed specifically for resource-constrained networks. SWORD utilizes a proximity-based clustering approach to enable offline authentication and data sharing, ensuring low-latency, secure operations even in intermittently connected scenarios. Our experimental results show that SWORD outperforms traditional blockchain-based solutions while offering similar resource efficiency and authentication latency to central-server-based solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating that SWORD is resilient against spoofing, impersonation, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u6848SWORD\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c5G\u4e0b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SWORD\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "SWORD\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u76f8\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "SWORD\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks.

This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components.

We propose CooperLLM, a cloud-assisted edge-end cooperative federated fine-tuning framework that combines ZOO on mobile devices with cloud-guided gradient rectification. Mobile clients perform lightweight ZOO updates on private data, while the cloud fine-tunes on auxiliary public data using backpropagation and injects guided perturbations to rectify local updates, improving convergence and accuracy without violating privacy.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u76f8\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168FIM\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0cChat LLMs\u548c\u901a\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSRI\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfFill-in-the-Middle\uff08FIM\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caChat LLMs\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u901a\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSearch-and-Replace Infilling\uff08SRI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u5355\u901a\u9053\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6SRI - 200K\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03SRI - Coder\u7cfb\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8ba9Chat\u6a21\u578b\u8865\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6FIM\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SRI\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u8865\u5168\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u793e\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing meme research is distributed across tasks (hate, misogyny, propaganda, sentiment, humour) and languages, which limits cross-domain generalization. To address this gap we propose MemeLens, a unified multilingual and multitask explanation-enhanced Vision Language Model (VLM) for meme understanding. We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect.

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165CEBiasBench\u548cMAV\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMACD\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u897f\u65b9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u897f\u65b9\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5426\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CEBiasBench\u548cMAV\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMACD\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u6846\u67b6\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u8f6c\u79fb\u504f\u5dee\uff0cMACD\u5728CEBiasBench\u548cCAMeL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, many OSS projects face operational risks due to informal or centralized governance. This paper presents a practical case study of data.table, a high-performance R package widely adopted in production analytics pipelines, which underwent a community-led governance reform to address scalability and sustainability concerns. Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\u03b5$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5e8f\u6570\u3001\u975e\u8865\u507f\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9610\u8ff0\u6b64\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u3001\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u70b9\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e8f\u6570\u3001\u975e\u8865\u507f\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u201c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u590d\u6742\u6027\u201d\u65b9\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Measuring the Impact of Coding Agents on Software Development", "categories": ["cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based coding agents increasingly act as autonomous contributors that generate and merge pull requests, yet their real-world effects on software projects are unclear, especially relative to widely adopted IDE-based AI assistants. We present a longitudinal causal study of agent adoption in open-source repositories using staggered difference-in-differences with matched controls. Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput benefits. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising roughly 18% and 35%, indicating sustained agent-induced complexity debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents.

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity.

Serving a request requires loading the pre-computed prefix KV cache and generating the first token, defined as the Re-Prefill Phase. Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.\n  This paper proposes \\textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \\textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification. By exploiting the high similarity in important ContiguousChunk indices across layers, we propose intra- and inter-period asynchronous prefetching to break the sequential dependency between I/O and compute, effectively eliminating idle bubbles. Finally, we propose attention-guided cache management to retain semantically critical prefix data in memory.

Unlike black-box API consumption, the reliability of user-managed orchestration remains a critical blind spot. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.\n  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects.

A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \\(\\ge0.97\\). Our privacy assessments (Table II) reveal that DP consistently lowers both identity disclosure risk (SD-IDR) and membership-inference attack risk (SD-MIA), with all DP-augmented models staying below the 0.09 regulatory threshold.

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD.

However, while competitive programming platforms provide abundant problems and solutions, high-quality test cases for verification remain scarce. Existing approaches attempt to synthesize test cases using Large Language Models (LLMs), but rely solely on the model's intrinsic generation capabilities without external feedback, frequently resulting in insufficiently diverse cases. To address this limitation, we propose a $\\textbf{Feedback-Driven Iterative Framework}$ for comprehensive test case construction. Specifically, our method leverages the LLM to generate initial test cases, executes them against known correct and incorrect solutions, and utilizes the failed results as feedback to guide the LLM in refining the test cases toward high fidelity and discriminability. We then apply this method to the CodeContests dataset to construct an optimized high-quality derivative, $\\textbf{CodeContests-O}$. Evaluating against the entire pool of solutions ($1.1 \\times 10^7$ in total), our dataset achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of $89.37\\%$ and True Negative Rate (TNR) of $90.89\\%$, significantly outperforming the CodeContests and CodeContests+ by margins of $4.32\\%$ and $9.37\\%$, respectively.

Although large language models (LLMs) perform well on general tasks, they often lack domain-specific knowledge and pedagogical capability to clearly explain complex space science concepts.\n  We introduce SolarGPT-QA, a question answering system based on a domain-adapted large language model built on the LLaMA-3 base model. The model is trained using scientific literature and large-scale question-answer data generated with GPT-4 and refined using Grok-3 in a student-friendly storytelling style. Human pairwise evaluations show that SolarGPT-QA outperforms general-purpose models in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance compared to instruction-tuned models for educational explanations in space weather and heliophysics.

Reliable carbon-credit certification depends on mechanisms that connect actual, measured renewable-energy production to verifiable emission-reduction records. Although blockchain and IoT technologies have been applied to emission monitoring and trading, existing work offers limited support for certification processes, particularly for small and medium-scale renewable installations. This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts. Unlike approaches focused on trading mechanisms, the proposed system aligns with European legislation and voluntary carbon-market standards, clarifying the practical requirements and constraints that apply to photovoltaic operators.

To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\\&A.

Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety.

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space.

This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making. Another contribution of this work is the release of the first-ever AIL HM dataset of SPS.

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query.

We tackle these problems with Threshold Differential Attention (TDA), a sink-free attention mechanism that achieves ultra-sparsity and improved robustness at longer sequence lengths without the computational overhead of projection methods or the performance degradation caused by noise accumulation of standard rectified attention. TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows.

This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization.

With the scaling of users and the emergence of denser storage media, the index has become a primary memory consumer, causing memory strain. Our extensive analysis of production traces reveals that write requests exhibit a strong tendency to target continuous block ranges in cloud storage systems. Thus, compared to current per-block indexing, our insight is that we should directly index block ranges (i.e., range-as-a-key) to save memory.\n  In this paper, we propose RASK, a memory-efficient and high-performance tree-structured index that natively indexes ranges. While range-as-a-key offers the potential to save memory and improve performance, realizing this idea is challenging due to the range overlap and range fragmentation issues. To handle range overlap efficiently, RASK introduces the log-structured leaf, combined with range-tailored search and garbage collection. To reduce range fragmentation, RASK employs range-aware split and merge mechanisms.

However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

In practice, they often grow to substantial size and complexity, undergoing thousands of modifications over time due to evolution, refactoring, and maintenance. The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model. We evaluate our approach on multi-location model changes that have actually been performed by developers in real-world projects.

While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%.

Although automated detection tools such as fuzzers have advanced considerably, effective resolution still often depends on human expertise. Existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) methods rely heavily on manually provided annotations (e.g., fault locations or CWE labels), which are often difficult and time-consuming to obtain, while overlooking the rich, naturally embedded semantic context found in issue reports from developers.\n  In this paper, we present VulnResolver, the first LLM-based hybrid agent framework for automated vulnerability issue resolution. VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities. Together, these agents produce structured analyses that enrich the original issue reports, enabling more accurate vulnerability localization and patch generation.\n  Evaluations on the SEC-bench benchmark show that VulnResolver resolves 75% of issues on SEC-bench Lite, achieving the best resolution performance. On SEC-bench Full, VulnResolver also significantly outperforms the strongest baseline, the agent-based OpenHands, confirming its effectiveness. Overall, VulnResolver delivers an adaptive and security-aware framework that advances end-to-end automated vulnerability issue resolution through workflow stability and the specialized agents' capabilities in contextual reasoning and property-based analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u5cfb\u3002\u73b0\u6709AVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u95ee\u9898\u62a5\u544a\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684VulnResolver\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u95ee\u9898\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVulnResolver\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CPCAgent\uff09\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\uff08SPAAgent\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728SEC - bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVulnResolver\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SEC - bench Lite\u4e2d75%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5728SEC - bench Full\u4e2d\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfOpenHands\u3002", "conclusion": "VulnResolver\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features.

While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data.

However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated function/class-level generation (e.g., ClassEval) or modifications to existing codebases (e.g., SWE-Bench), neglecting complete microservice repository generation that reflects real-world 0-to-1 development workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce RepoGenesis, the first multilingual benchmark for repository-level end-to-end web microservice generation, comprising 106 repositories (60 Python, 46 Java) across 18 domains and 11 frameworks, with 1,258 API endpoints and 2,335 test cases verified through a \"review-rebuttal\" quality assurance process. We evaluate open-source agents (e.g., DeepCode) and commercial IDEs (e.g., Cursor) using Pass@1, API Coverage (AC), and Deployment Success Rate (DSR).

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSL - CBM\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709CBM\u5c40\u90e8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) \u5c40\u90e8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSL - CBM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u96c6\u62101x1\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSL - CBM\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SL - CBM\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR.

To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances.

This motivates an investigation into the reasons behind such behavior beyond algorithmic design. In this study, we find that one such reason lies in the distribution shift across training domains. A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6316\u6398\u767b\u9769\u70ed\u57ce\u5e02\u533a\u57df\u6f5c\u4f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u901a\u52e4\u6d41\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u767b\u9769\u70ed\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u533a\u6784\u6210\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u4f20\u64ad\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u516c\u5f00\u767b\u9769\u70ed\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u6f5c\u4f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u70ed\u70b9\u5386\u53f2\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u56db\u5468\u70ed\u70b9\u5386\u53f2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747F - \u5206\u65700.79\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u901a\u52e4\u6d41\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process. Developers primarily implement text-focused features while struggling with API limitations and organizational constraints. Through systematic cross-platform comparison, we identify novel platform-specific barriers and demonstrate how accessibility practices differ across developer experience levels.

It is built on top of answer set programming (ASP) and transition systems to represent how human mental states evolve in response to sequences of observable actions. Drawing on well-established psychological theories, such as the Appraisal Theory of Emotion, we formalize mental states, such as emotions, as multi-dimensional configurations. With the objective to address the need for controlled agent behaviors and to restrict unwanted mental side-effects of actions, we extend the language with a novel causal rule, forbids to cause, along with expressions specialized for mental state dynamics, which enables the modeling of principles for valid transitions between mental states. These principles of mental change are translated into transition constraints, and properties of invariance, which are rigorously evaluated using transition systems in terms of so-called trajectories. This enables controlled reasoning about the dynamic evolution of human mental states. Furthermore, the framework supports the comparison of different dynamics of change by analyzing trajectories that adhere to different psychological principles.

However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code.

We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness.

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIceWatch\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eGLOF\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178GLOF\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u6162\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u529b\u3001\u53d7\u4e91\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\u5f71\u54cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIceWatch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176RiskFlow\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7528CNN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TerraFlow\u548cTempFlow\u8003\u8651\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0GLOF\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IceWatch\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684GLOF\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u6709\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5168\u7403\u51b0\u5ddd\u76d1\u6d4b\u6d3b\u52a8\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u901a\u7528AI\u867d\u6d41\u884c\u4f46\u6709\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1AI\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u901a\u7528AI\u5728RAI\u539f\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51faC2V2\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u76f8\u5173\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u901a\u7528AI\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528AI\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\uff08RAI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f9d\u636e\u516b\u9879RAI\u539f\u5219\u5ba1\u67e5\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1AI\uff0c\u63d0\u51faC2V2\u51c6\u5219\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u901a\u7528AI\u8f93\u51fa\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51faC2V2\u51c6\u5219\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u672a\u6765\u901a\u7528AI\u7684RAI\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728C2V2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u6216\u9886\u57df\u7684RAI\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u539f\u6709\u56db\u6307\u6807TIVS\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5f97\u5230TIVS - O\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u7eff\u8272\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u9632\u5fa1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5f97\u5230TIVS - O\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406301\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u65b0\u589eOSR\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1141.6%\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff1b\u4e94\u79cdTIVS - O\u914d\u7f6e\u63ed\u793a\u7f13\u89e3\u4e25\u683c\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u533b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Bills of Materials (BOMs) have emerged as a structured way to document product components, their interrelationships, and key metadata, improving visibility and security across digital supply chains. This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains.

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning.

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families.

Many plants still operate with conventional valves that lack real time monitoring, making early predictions challenging. This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for detecting and predicting stiction using only routinely collected process signals: the controller output (OP) from control systems and the process variable (PV), such as flow rate. Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data.

This work introduces a multi-agent refinement framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of medical LLMs through structured, iterative alignment. Our system combines two generative models - DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM - with two evaluation agents, LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4, which assess responses using the American Medical Association's (AMA) Principles of Medical Ethics and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5) protocol. We evaluate performance across 900 clinically diverse queries spanning nine ethical domains, measuring convergence efficiency, ethical violation reduction, and domain-specific risk behavior.

Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOPO\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u91cf\u5e7f\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51faOPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408alpha\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5361\u65b9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "OPO\u4ea7\u751f\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6761\u4ef6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u68af\u5ea6\u9971\u548c\u3002", "conclusion": "OPO\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Analyzing 25,000+ chain-of-thought trajectories across four domains (Law, Science, Code, Math) and two scales (8B, 70B parameters), we discover that neural scaling laws trigger domain-specific phase transitions rather than uniform capability gains. Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics.

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development.

This version corresponds to the initial public release of the CUA architecture and associated evaluation metrics", "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u539f\u5219\u53caCUA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCUA\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u914d\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6784\u5efaCognitive Universal Agent (CUA)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4CUA\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0cCUA\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u65e9\u4e14\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6536\u655b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u63a2\u7a76\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u683c\u5c40\uff1b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\uff0c\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u914d\u7684CUA\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.\n  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines.

However, many of these apps demand excessive permissions and misuse sensitive user data for coercive debt-recovery practices, including harassment, blackmail, and public shaming that affect both borrowers and their contacts.\n  This paper presents the first cross-country measurement of loan app compliance against both national regulations and Google's Financial Services Policy. We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.\n  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy.

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data.

We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings. To deal with the relativistic setting, we extended our regularization to penalize violations of Lorentzian signatures, which allowed us to predict a geodesic Lagrangian under AdS\\textsubscript{4} spacetime metric directly from trajectory data, which to our knowledge has not been done in the literature before.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation.

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model.

In this problem, a central authority must decide, in real time, when to charge dynamically arriving electric vehicles (EVs), subject to capacity limits, with the objective of balancing load across a finite planning horizon. To solve the problem, we first gamify it; that is, we model it as a game where charging blocks are placed within temporal and capacity constraints on a grid. We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses.

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models.

In this paper, we introduce two advanced machine-learning architectures tailored for predicting biosignature species fluxes from exoplanetary reflected-light spectra: a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) and our novel model architecture, the Spectral Query Adaptive Transformer (SQuAT). The BCNN robustly quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, offering reliable predictions under diverse observational conditions, whereas SQuAT employs query-driven attention mechanisms to enhance interpretability by explicitly associating spectral features with specific biosignature species. We demonstrate that both models achieve comparably high predictive accuracy on an augmented dataset spanning a wide range of exoplanetary conditions, while highlighting their distinct advantages in uncertainty quantification and spectral interpretability.

This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence.

Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning.

The models achieved strong performance in predicting monthly binge drinking and having more than five sexual partners, with F1 scores of 0.78, and moderate performance in predicting PrEP use and heavy drinking, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.63. These findings demonstrate that social media and dating app text data can provide valuable insights into risk and protective behaviors and highlight the potential of large language model-based methods to support scalable and personalized public health interventions for MSM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u7ea6\u4f1a\u5e94\u7528\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u7537\u540c\u6027\u604b\u8005\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u996e\u9152\u548cPrEP\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e0d\u9519\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7537\u540c\u6027\u604b\u8005\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u611f\u67d3\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u996e\u9152\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u7ea6\u4f1a\u5e94\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u7ecf\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u540c\u610f\u6536\u96c6\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528ChatGPT\u5d4c\u5165\u3001BERT\u5d4c\u5165\u3001LIWC\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5178\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u672f\u8bed\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u6708 binge \u996e\u9152\u548c\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u6027\u4f34\u4fa3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff08F1\u5206\u65700.78\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4bPrEP\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u996e\u9152\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\uff08F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.64\u548c0.63\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u7ea6\u4f1a\u5e94\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u671b\u652f\u6301\u9488\u5bf9\u7537\u540c\u6027\u604b\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

Evolutionary algorithms offer a promising approach to generating such perturbations due to their ability to navigate non-convex, gradient-free landscapes. In this work, we introduce a float-coded, penalty-driven single-objective evolutionary framework for UAP generation that achieves lower visibility perturbations while enhancing attack success rates. Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures. Additionally, we ensure the universality of the generated perturbations by testing across diverse models and by periodically switching batches to prevent overfitting. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently produces perturbations with smaller norms, higher misclassification effectiveness, and faster convergence compared to existing evolutionary-based methods.

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks.

SHAP, in particular, is often treated as a reliable account of which features drove an individual prediction.

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models.

However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%.

DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome.

Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms.

We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning.

The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants.

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research.

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance.

We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u7c7b\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5e72\u9884\u4e5f\u672a\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u8868\u9762\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRELIEF\u6846\u67b6\u5851\u9020\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u6027\u80fd\u597d\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5851\u9020LRM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14LRMs\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355logit\u63a2\u6d4b\u6355\u6349LRMs\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRELIEF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5408\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u95ee\u81ea\u7b54\u5bf9\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRELIEF\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u5ff5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5851\u9020\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models.

This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions.

While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7ba1\u9053SIT - Graph\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u9886\u57df\u96be\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIT - Graph\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u8282\u70b9\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u518d\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8282\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u54cd\u5e94\u6269\u5145\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5c06SIT - Graph\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u7387\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8d8520%\u3002", "conclusion": "SIT - Graph\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions.

To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study.

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools.

Our approach enables generation of valid closed rings by design and demonstrates strong performance in generating conformers that are both diverse and precise. We show that PuckerFlow outperforms other conformer generation methods on nearly all quantitative metrics and illustrate the potential of PuckerFlow for ring systems relevant to chemical applications, particularly in catalysis and drug discovery.

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u7531\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u7269\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5171\u6027\u53ca\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u5e95\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u751f\u7269\u96c6\u4f53\uff08\u4ece\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5230\u751f\u7269\u6574\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u5404\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u7269\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5171\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e0e\u57fa\u5e95\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, most TTA methods are designed for independent data, often overlooking the time series data and rarely addressing forecasting tasks.

By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data.

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.\n  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fd1\u4f3c(s,S)\u5e93\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5e93\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u5ba1\u67e5(s,S)\u5e93\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f4e\u9636\u77e9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u91cd\u590d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5e93\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8840\u6d82\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u75c5\u5168\u7403\u6d41\u884c\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u9570\u72b6\u7ec6\u80de\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3001\u907f\u514d\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u5e73\u9762\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u80de\u957f\u8f74\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b096.03%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f62\u72b6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In practice, however, their performance is often hindered by limited representational capacity and optimization difficulties caused by competing physical constraints and conflicting gradients. In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs.

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u96be\u8ffd\u8e2a\u79d1\u7814\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51faPaperCompass\u6846\u67b6\u53caDFPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u589e\u957f\u5feb\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u9605\u8bfb\u96be\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e14\u4f4e\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPaperCompass\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165DFPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8349\u7a3f\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eDFPO\u6709\u826f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728Paper - QA\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPaperCompass\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "PaperCompass\u6846\u67b6\u548cDFPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now enable simulated interaction partners that may support early skills development. This study examined postgraduate clinical psychology students' perceptions of two AI-based simulations: a text-based chatbot (ChatGPT) and a voice-based avatar (HeyGen). Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions. However, the avatar was rated significantly higher than the chatbot for perceived usefulness, skill application, and perceived skill improvement, and qualitative comments highlighted the added value of voice-based interaction for conveying social and emotional cues.

Many existing systems use fixed question lists, strict rules, and limited personalization, leading to repeated conversations that cause low engagement. Therefore, these tools are not effective for complex qualitative research, which requires flexibility, context awareness, and ethical sensitivity. Consequently, there is a need for a more adaptive and context-aware interviewing system. To address this, an AI-powered interviewer that dynamically generates questions that are contextually appropriate and expertise aligned is presented in this study. The interviewer is built on a locally hosted large language model (LLM) that generates coherent dialogue while preserving data privacy. The interviewer profiles the participants' expertise in real time to generate knowledge-appropriate questions, well-articulated responses, and smooth transition messages similar to human-like interviews. To implement these functionalities, a modular prompt engineering pipeline was designed to ensure that the interview conversation remains scalable, adaptive, and semantically rich. To evaluate the AI-powered interviewer, it was tested with various participants, and it achieved high satisfaction (mean 4.45) and engagement (mean 4.33).

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

Using object recognition, the system detects and localizes components in real time to create a digital twin of the workspace. For each assembly step, it overlays bounding boxes in AR to indicate both the current position and the target placement of relevant components, while hand-tracking data verifies whether the user interacts with the correct part. Rather than enforcing a fixed sequence, the system highlights potential assembly errors and interprets user deviations as opportunities for iteration and creative exploration.

This study investigates the quality of feedback generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), compared with human feedback, in three computer science course with technical writing components: an introductory computer science course (CS2), a third-year advanced systems course (operating systems), and a third-year writing course (a topics course on artificial intelligence). Using a mixed-methods approach which integrates quantitative Likert-scale questions with qualitative commentary, we analyze the student perspective on feedback quality, evaluated based on multiple criteria, including readability, detail, specificity, actionability, helpfulness, and overall quality. The analysis reveals that in the larger upper-year operating systems course ($N=80$), SLMs and LLMs are perceived to deliver clear, actionable, and well-structured feedback, while humans provide more contextually nuanced guidance. As for the high-enrollment CS2 course ($N=176$) showed the same preference for the AI tools' clarity and breadth, but students noted that AI feedback sometimes lacked the concise, straight-to-the-point, guidance offered by humans.

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u836f\u623f\u573a\u666f\u91c7\u7528\u7a84\u800c\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8981\u6c42\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u623f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u805a\u7126\u7a84\u800c\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ee1\u8db3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8981\u6c42\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56de\u590d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4e14\u8981\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e4b\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations.

While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention.

Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality. We combine robustness-driven large-batch training with spherical model merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and optimize inference via vLLM and FP8 quantization.

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u70b9\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6270\u52a8\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u70b9\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u5e38\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u53ef\u63a7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53ef\u7f13\u51b2\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u5143\u72b6\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u5148\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, their evaluation is often limited to accuracy on medical multiple choice question (MCQ) benchmarks, and lacks evaluation of consistency, robustness, or reasoning behavior. We use MCQ coupled to human evaluation and clinical review to assess six small open-source medical LLMs (HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen 2024), Diabetica-7B, Diabetica-o1 (Wei 2024), Meditron3-8B (Sallinen2025), MedFound-7B (Liu 2025), and ClinicaGPT-base-zh (Wang 2023)) in pediatric endocrinology. In deterministic settings, we examine the effect of prompt variation on models' output and self-assessment bias. In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u5185\u5206\u6ccc\u5b66\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "HuatuoGPT - o1 - 8B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Using the GTSRB dataset, we evaluate robustness against FGSM and PGD attacks at a standard $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbation budget of $\\varepsilon = 8/255$. Relative to clean training, standard adversarial training provides modest improvements in robustness ($\\sim$10 percentage points).

To tackle this challenge we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time.

We investigate this by evaluating base and instruction-tuned models on standard math benchmarks, structurally perturbed variants, and domain-shifted tasks. Our analysis highlights two key (often overlooked) limitations of instruction tuning. First, the performance advantage is unstable and depends heavily on evaluation settings. In zero-shot CoT settings on GSM8K, base models consistently outperform instruction-tuned variants, with drops as high as 32.67\\% (Llama3-70B).

However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance.

Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives.

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation.

We analyze key factors governing SD performance, and quantify a theoretical upper bound on SD speedup. Our results show that verification by the target model dominates the execution, while acceptance length varies markedly across output token positions, requests, and datasets.

Using the state-of-the-art $\u03b1,\u03b2$-CROWN verifier, we evaluate ResNet4 models across varying pruning ratios on MNIST and, more importantly, on the NASA JPL Mars Frost Identification datasets. Our findings demonstrate a non-linear relationship: light pruning (40%) in MNIST and heavy pruning (70%-90%) in JPL improve verifiability, allowing models to outperform unpruned baselines in proven $L_\\infty$ robustness properties. This suggests that reduced connectivity simplifies the search space for formal solvers and that the optimal pruning ratio varies significantly between datasets.

The goal of this task is to evaluate how effectively computational models can generate highlights that capture the key contributions, findings, and novelty of a paper in a concise form. Highlights help readers grasp essential ideas quickly and are often easier to read and understand than longer paragraphs, especially on mobile devices. The track uses the MixSub dataset \\cite{10172215}, which provides pairs of abstracts and corresponding author-written highlights.\n  In this inaugural edition of the track, 12 teams participated, exploring various approaches, including pre-trained language models, to generate highlights from this scientific dataset. All submissions were evaluated using established metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore to measure both alignment with author-written highlights and overall informativeness.

Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.\n  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models.

In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a \"clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture\" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms. Agents engage through casual chat and deliberative interactions to evaluate research outputs and distribute a virtual currency as rewards. This incentive mechanism aims to achieve incentive compatibility through consensus-driven evaluation, while blockchain technology ensures immutable records of all transactions and reputation data.

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u548c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790777\u540d\u4e03\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6e38\u620f\u5b66\u4e60\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u91cd\u73a9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u5373\u65f6\u91cd\u73a9\u66f4\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7a76\u5b66\u751f\u6e38\u620f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u91cd\u73a9\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9777\u540d\u4e03\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u548c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u95ee\u9898\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u5b66\u751f\u503e\u5411\u6301\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u6210\u529f\u540e\u7acb\u5373\u91cd\u73a9\uff1b\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u91cd\u73a9\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5373\u65f6\u91cd\u73a9\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u91cd\u73a9\u5173\u8054\u5f31\u6216\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u91cd\u73a9\u5e76\u975e\u90fd\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u5373\u65f6\u91cd\u73a9\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art Code-LLMs using zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms. Each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap, indicating that current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning. RTCE surfaces several new and previously unmeasured insights that are not captured by existing I/O-prediction, execution-reasoning, or round-trip natural-language benchmarks. We will release the code and the dataset upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f80\u8fd4\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRTCE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f80\u8fd4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f80\u8fd4\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684RTCE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5404\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u5f80\u8fd4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cRTCE\u6709\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

We propose \\emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \\pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \\pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWaveLSFormer\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u65e5\u5185\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u76c8\u5229\u7684\u65e5\u5185\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u591a\u7a7aTransformer\u6a21\u578bWaveLSFormer\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5c0f\u6ce2\u524d\u7aef\u548cLGHI\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ecf\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5e76\u4ee5\u4ea4\u6613\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u5e74\u884c\u4e1a\u7ec4\u4e94\u5e74\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u5341\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cWaveLSFormer\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7d2f\u79ef\u7b56\u7565\u56de\u62a50.607\u00b10.045\uff0c\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u73872.157\u00b10.166\u3002", "conclusion": "WaveLSFormer\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u3002"}}

Sources from major academic and grey-literature repositories from the past decade were screened. The search identified 2,216 records; after deduplication and screening, 645 articles underwent eligibility assessment, and 122 were included for analysis. The corpus was organized along three thematic categories: technical solutions, policy/regulatory measures, and education/awareness strategies. Findings reveal that while technical interventions such as on-device processing, federated learning, and lightweight encryption significantly reduce data exposure, their adoption remains limited. Policy frameworks, including the EU's GDPR, the UK Age-Appropriate Design Code, and Canada's PIPEDA, provide important baselines but are hindered by gaps in enforcement and age-appropriate design obligations, while educational initiatives are rarely integrated systematically into curricula. Overall, the corpus skews toward technical solutions (67%) relative to policy (21%) and education (12%), indicating an implementation gap outside the technical domain. To address these challenges, we recommend a multi-stakeholder model in which policymakers, manufacturers, and educators co-develop inclusive, transparent, and context-sensitive privacy ecosystems.

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling. In addition, a compact neural network maps engineering descriptors, such as maximum directional strains, to latent codes, facilitating the generation of performance-informed geometry.

This oversight results in suboptimal performance due to two fundamental limitations: the inability to capture scenario-specific features and the failure to resolve inherent inter-scenario conflicts.

Using controlled classification and regression studies, we show how relative model performance follows systematic trends in complexity, noise, and dimensionality, and how these trends can be distilled into a predictive criterion.

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4eTucker\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4eTucker\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5168\u5f20\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u6602\u8d35\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728Tucker\u5206\u89e3\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u5f20\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5f20\u91cf\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u949f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u968f\u673a\u5f20\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u968f\u673a\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4eTucker\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves R\u00e9nyi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5370\u5c3c\u8bed\u97f3\u8282\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u5408\u5370\u5c3c\u8bed\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c0a\u91cd\u5176\u9ecf\u7740\u8bed\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u6559\u5b66\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5148\u6309\u97f3\u8282\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u542b3500\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\uff0c\u97f3\u8282\u5206\u8bcd\u6cd5R\u00e9nyi\u6548\u7387\u8fbe0.74\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u6559\u5b66\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u5c11\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMN - TSG\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0cNCDEs\u5728\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eedTSG\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMN - TSG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684NCDEs\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6709TSG\u6a21\u578b\uff0cMoE - NCDE\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMN - TSG\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684TSG\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "MN - TSG\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment.

Current compression methods like quantization, pruning and low-rank factorization reduce constant factors but leave the scaling bottleneck unresolved. We introduce ButterflyMoE, a method that treats experts not as independent weight matrices but as geometric reorientations of a unified shared quantized substrate. Diversity among experts arises from viewing different angles of shared capacity, not from redundant storage. By applying learned rotations to a shared ternary prototype, each expert yields $\\mathcal{O}(d^2 + N \\cdot d \\log d)$ memory -- sub-linear in the number of experts. The key insight: training these rotations with quantization reduces activation outliers and stabilizes extreme low bit training, where static methods collapse. Across language modeling benchmarks, ButterflyMoE achieves 150 times memory reduction at 256 experts with negligible accuracy loss.

An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions.

The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement.

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications.

Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.\n  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability.

Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks.

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.

However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReinforced Agent Merging (RAM) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e76\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReinforced Agent Merging (RAM) \u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u90e8\u5206\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRAM \u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u5408\u5e76\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "RAM \u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

FG-OrIU decomposes feature spaces via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), separating forgetting and remaining class features into distinct subspaces. It then enforces dual constraints: feature orthogonal projection on both forgetting and remaining classes, while gradient orthogonal projection prevents the reintroduction of forgotten knowledge and disruption to remaining classes during updates. Additionally, dynamic subspace adaptation merges newly forgetting subspaces and contracts remaining subspaces, ensuring a stable balance between removal and retention across sequential unlearning tasks.

Meanwhile, machine learning inference workloads increasingly migrate to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms for their scalability and cost-efficiency [2], [3], [4]. However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency.

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution.

From an operational standpoint, this study investigates critical limitations inherent to hybrid forecasting frameworks that embed deep neural networks into numerical prediction models, with a specific focus on two fundamental bottlenecks: coupling compatibility and long-term integration stability. A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations.

However, their strict unidirectional block dependencies introduce irreversibility and sacrifice the global planning capabilities for which diffusion models are renowned. In order to address these issues, we propose Diffusion in Diffusion, a draft-then-refine framework designed to overcome the irreversibility and myopia problems inherent in block diffusion models. Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark for discrete diffusion models on the OpenWebText dataset.

Across nonlinear function regression, PDE learning, and image classification, FIPA consistently improves over averaging-based aggregation, and can be effectively combined with state-of-the-art client-side optimization algorithms to further improve image classification accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. \"foveated\") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a \"same\" or \"different\" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware.

We study pre-operative prediction of clinically meaningful improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), defining success as a more than 8.9-point reduction in SNOT-22 at 6 months (MCID). In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting. Notably, GenAI justifications align with clinician heuristics and the MLP's feature importance, repeatedly highlighting baseline SNOT-22, CT/endoscopy severity, polyp phenotype, and physchology/pain comorbidities. We provide a reproducible tabular-to-GenAI evaluation protocol and subgroup analyses.

While recent deep networks such as transformers and activation-free architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy, their efficiency is typically measured in FLOPs or parameters, which do not correlate with latency on embedded hardware. We propose a hardware-aware adaptation framework that restructures existing models through sensitivity-guided block substitution, surrogate distillation, and training-free multi-objective search driven by device profiling. Applied to the 36-block NAFNet baseline, the optimized variants achieve up to 55% reduction in GMACs compared to the recent transformer-based SOTA while maintaining competitive accuracy. Most importantly, on-device deployment yields a 1.25X latency improvement over the baseline. Experiments on motion deblurring (GoPro), defocus deblurring (DPDD), and auxiliary benchmarks (RealBlur-J/R, HIDE) demonstrate the generality of the approach, while comparisons with prior efficient baselines confirm its accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

We further analyze safety-first operating points on artifact-prone recordings and show that a hierarchical context strategy extending the receptive field for high-noise subjects can markedly reduce false alarms (down to 0.00 FPR/h in an extreme outlier) without sacrificing sensitivity.

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models.

This task can be framed as a reverse Turing test in which a computer has to detect if an input instance has been generated by a human or artificially. To tackle this task, we study ten public datasets of handwritten symbols (isolated characters, digits, gestures, pointing traces, and signatures) that are artificially reproduced using seven different synthesizers, including, among others, the Kinematic Theory (Sigma h model), generative adversarial networks, Transformers, and Diffusion models. We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3 percent Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4 percent equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input.

As autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for accurate and reliable ETA estimation has grown, playing a vital role in navigation, mobility planning, and traffic management. However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction. ETA prediction inherently involves spatio-temporal causality, and our proposed model addresses this by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract and utilize temporal features accumulated at each spatio-temporal point along a route. This architecture enables efficient and accurate ETA estimation while keeping the model lightweight and scalable.

ELSA introduces three key innovations. First, it employs a task-agnostic, behavior-aware client clustering mechanism that constructs semantic fingerprints using public probe inputs and symmetric KL divergence, further enhanced by prediction-consistency-based trust scoring and latency-aware edge assignment to jointly address data heterogeneity, client unreliability, and communication constraints. Second, it splits the LLM into three parts across clients and edge servers, with the cloud used only for adapter aggregation, enabling an effective balance between on-device computation cost and global convergence stability. Third, it incorporates a lightweight communication scheme based on computational sketches combined with semantic subspace orthogonal perturbation (SS-OP) to reduce communication overhead while mitigating privacy leakage during model exchanges.

By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection.

We derive a closed-form expression for the expected generalization loss in the high-dimensional regime that holds for arbitrary linear teachers. We demonstrate that isotropic regularization mitigates label noise under both single-teacher and multiple i.i.d. teacher settings, whereas prior work accommodating multiple teachers either did not employ regularization or used memory-demanding methods.

These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth.

Social media language provides an opportunity for scalable detection, but current models often lack interpretability, keyword-robustness validation, and rigorous user-level data integrity. This work presents a transparent approach to social media-based anxiety detection through linguistically interpretable feature-grounded modeling and cross-domain validation. Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data. Results indicate that transparent linguistic features can support reliable, generalizable, and keyword-robust anxiety detection.

Conventional strategies rank high in benchmarks due to their intrinsic capabilities to handle numerical inputs and careful modelling choices that balance exploration and Pareto-front exploitation, as well as handle multiple (conflicting) objectives. In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance.

Code available at https://github.com/gogipav14/spectral-llm", "summary": "Learning precise Boolean logic via gradient descent remains challenging: neural networks typically converge to \"fuzzy\" approximations that degrade under quantization. We introduce Hierarchical Spectral Composition, a differentiable architecture that selects spectral coefficients from a frozen Boolean Fourier basis and composes them via Sinkhorn-constrained routing with column-sign modulation. Our approach draws on recent insights from Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), which demonstrated that projecting routing matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope preserves identity mappings and stabilizes large-scale training. We adapt this framework to logic synthesis, adding column-sign modulation to enable Boolean negation -- a capability absent in standard doubly stochastic routing.\n  We validate our approach across four phases of increasing complexity: (1) For n=2 (16 Boolean operations over 4-dim basis), gradient descent achieves 100% accuracy with zero routing drift and zero-loss quantization to ternary masks. (2) For n=3 (10 three-variable operations), gradient descent achieves 76% accuracy, but exhaustive enumeration over 3^8 = 6561 configurations proves that optimal ternary masks exist for all operations (100% accuracy, 39% sparsity). (3) For n=4 (10 four-variable operations over 16-dim basis), spectral synthesis -- combining exact Walsh-Hadamard coefficients, ternary quantization, and MCMC refinement with parallel tempering -- achieves 100% accuracy on all operations. This progression establishes (a) that ternary polynomial threshold representations exist for all tested functions, and (b) that finding them requires methods beyond pure gradient descent as dimensionality grows.

In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart. This iterative procedure yields a contrastive detoxification dataset used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its ability for safe and coherent text generation. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as DetoxLLM and ParaDetox show that our method achieves better detoxification performance than state-of-the-art methods while preserving semantic fidelity. By obviating the need for human intervention or external components, this paper reveals the intrinsic self-detoxification ability of LLMs, offering a consistent and effective approach for mitigating harmful content generation.

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\\% and 8.80\\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \\& Resize with a 77\\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87).

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLinearized Subspace Refinement (LSR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165Iterative LSR\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6c42\u89e3\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u5408\u635f\u5931\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5165Iterative LSR\u3002", "result": "LSR\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e38\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\uff1bIterative LSR\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LSR\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for like-for-like operational assessment of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) under identical, real-world driving conditions. The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies.

To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5c0f\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u83b7\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u901a\u8fc7API\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6743\u91cd\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u6548\u7528\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65bd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u5728PAC\u9690\u79c1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u6bcf\u67e5\u8be2\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u83b7\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5982CIFAR - 10\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87.79%\uff1b\u80fd\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5728CIFAR - 10\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.86%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u79c1\u6709\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented.

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation.

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances.

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e3b\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ecb\u5165\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u6570\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u6307\u5bfc\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u6027\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e72\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08InT\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\u88ab\u5f3a\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e5f\u9887\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08InT\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u6b65\u5e72\u9884\uff1b\u518d\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u70b9\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7InT\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728IMO - AnswerBench\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd44B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd114%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5982gpt - oss - 20b\u7b49\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e72\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08InT\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5e38\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faJet - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684BF16\u8bad\u7ec3+FP8\u5c55\u5f00\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJet - RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684FP8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c55\u5f00\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u901f\u8fbe33%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u901f\u8fbe41%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63d0\u901f16%\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "Jet - RL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness.

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection.

Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\u03c3^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5e7fMNCIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASNC\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5d29\u6e83\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8c31\u9699\u574d\u584c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5411\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7fMNCIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faASNC\u7b97\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6765\u60e9\u7f5a\u8c31\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u71b5\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5982\u57283D\u7eb3\u7ef4 - \u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u65e0\u7c98\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u8d85\u6df1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5e94 - \u6269\u6563\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u56fe\u7075\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5d29\u6e83\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRLHB\u548cCoTHB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u673a\u9047\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRLHB\u548cCoTHB\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6709\u6548\u6298\u8877\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa3D TransUNet\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4eceT1w MRI\u9884\u6d4bFA\u548cMD\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AD\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027", "motivation": "AD\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cdMRI\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u4eceT1w MRI\u83b7\u53d6dMRI\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u6784\u5efa3D TransUNet\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4eceT1w MRI\u9884\u6d4bFA\u548cMD\u56fe", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\uff0cSSIM\u8d850.93\uff0cPearson\u76f8\u5173\u8d850.94\uff1b\u63d0\u5347AD\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u73875%\uff0cMCI\u68c0\u6d4b\u738712.5%", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4eceT1w MRI\u63a8\u65ad\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbAD\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027"}}

This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control.

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistent acceleration and quality improvements across multiple benchmarks and model architectures, validating MOD-DiT's effectiveness for efficient, high-quality video generation while overcoming the computational limitations of traditional sparse attention approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMOD - DiT\u89e3\u51b3Diffusion Transformers\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Diffusion Transformers\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMOD - DiT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u5229\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u7acb\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a9\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u5757\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MOD - DiT\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled framework for auditing these risks, yet existing methods achieve limited detection rates, particularly at the low false-positive thresholds required for practical privacy auditing. We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR).

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer quantitative tools for OA assessment but depend on large, well-annotated image datasets, mainly X-ray scans, that are often difficult to obtain because of privacy, governance and resourcing constraints. In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Using PSSF, we create a virtual cohort of 180 subjects (260 knees), each is imaged under three protocols (reference, low-dose, and geometry-shift). Medial joint regions are automatically localized, preprocessed, and processed with the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like \"0\" vs. \"2\") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images. Robustness is assessed within IBSI protocol, cross-protocol, and multi-protocol scenarios.

As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions.

However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them.

Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously.

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs.

A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores.

Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories.

To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bAllShowers\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u79cd\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u7c07\u5c04\uff0c\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u7c07\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u6309\u7c92\u5b50\u79cd\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u590d\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u6a21\u578bAllShowers\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7c07\u5c04\u53ca\u5c42\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728ILD\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u7c07\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u7c92\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7c07\u5c04\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u5f3a\u5b50\u7c07\u5c04\u5355\u7c92\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AllShowers\u662f\u5bf9\u649e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u7c07\u5c04\u6a21\u62df\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities.

Prior work has progressed from using basic visual features like color, motion, and structural changes to using pre-trained vision-language models that can better understand what's happening in the video (semantics) and capture temporal flow, resulting in more context-aware video summarization. We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos.

To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy.

This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\\%, sensitivity of 97.8\\%, specificity of 96.3\\%, F1-score of 98.2\\%, and overall precision of 97.9\\%. These metrics demonstrate a significant improvement over traditional methods and confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying cancerous masses in complex scenarios and large datasets.

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u666e\u901a\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u7167\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u50cf\u9700\u89c6\u7ebf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u6210\u50cf\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u7ebf\u53d7\u963b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u88ab\u52a8\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5149\u906e\u6321\u548c\u975e\u5149\u906e\u6321\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5SSD\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u4f17\u591a3D\u573a\u666f\u6709\u6548\uff0cSSD\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u573a\u666f\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5149\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u666e\u901a\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u7167\u7247\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0cSSD\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library.

While their capabilities are well-documented, their robustness against adversarial manipulation in competitive ranking scenarios remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we uncover a critical vulnerability in VLM-based product search: multimodal ranking attacks. We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines.

Because Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks crucially depend on reasoning about latent mental states of oneself and others, such models are therefore often thought to fail at ToM. While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan & Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling.

We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes.

Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\u00e8ve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\\times$240$\\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases.

Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain. However, delineating these areas manually in brain histological sections is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes.

Addressing this ``aging'' effect via frequent retraining is often impractical due to computational costs and privacy constraints. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Adversarial Drift-Aware Predictive Transfer (ADAPT), a novel framework designed to confer durability against temporal drift with minimal retraining. ADAPT innovatively constructs an uncertainty set of plausible future models by combining historical source models and limited current data. By optimizing worst-case performance over this set, it balances current accuracy with robustness against degradation due to future drifts. Crucially, ADAPT requires only summary-level model estimators from historical periods, preserving data privacy and ensuring operational simplicity. Validated on longitudinal suicide risk prediction using electronic health records from Mass General Brigham (2005--2021) and Duke University Health Systems, ADAPT demonstrated superior stability across coding transitions and pandemic-induced shifts.

This study investigates the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) in detecting Higgs Boson signals using the ATLAS Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge 2014 experiment dataset. We implemented a dimensionality reduction pipeline using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to map 30 physical features into 4-qubit and 8-qubit latent spaces. We benchmarked three configurations: (A) a shallow 4-qubit circuit, (B) a deep 4-qubit circuit with increased entanglement layers, and (C) an expanded 8-qubit circuit. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing circuit depth significantly improves performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 56.2% (Configuration B), compared to a baseline of 51.9%. Conversely, simply scaling to 8 qubits resulted in a performance degradation to 50.6% due to optimization challenges associated with Barren Plateaus in the larger Hilbert space.

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns.

However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence.

We introduce a scalable bias-auditing framework using named entities as probes to measure structural disparities in model behavior. We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences.

Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline.

In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable.

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStreaming OpInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOpInf\u662f\u6279\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u52a0\u8f7d\u5230\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStreaming OpInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u91cfSVD\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u9012\u5f52LS\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5f0f\u7b97\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cStreaming OpInf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6279\u91cf OpInf \u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1199%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc731000\u500d\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Streaming OpInf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf OpInf \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5e26\u8bed\u97f3\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6297\u566aAVSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728LRS3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAVSR\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6297\u566aAVSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eConformer\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u89c6\u9891\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u97f3\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171LRS3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u6001\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training.

Our systematic evaluation of both open- and closed-source LLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art, high-accuracy models often fail to abstain with uncertain.

These findings highlight the central role of abstention mechanisms for trustworthy LLM deployment and offer practical guidance for improving safety in high-stakes applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u533b\u7597\u591a\u9009\u95ee\u7b54\u5f03\u6743\u57fa\u51c6MedAbstain\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u5f03\u6743\u9009\u9879\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MedAbstain\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5f03\u6743\u9009\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e5f\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u5f03\u6743\u9009\u9879\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u66f4\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f03\u6743\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and generalizable decoding framework named Hierarchical Convolutional Fusion Transformer (HCFT), which combines dual-branch convolutional encoders and hierarchical Transformer blocks for multi-scale EEG representation learning. Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models.

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research.

We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e14\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u5904\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u773c\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u4e1a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u773c\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u5e78\u5b58\u8005\u89c6\u9891\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u773c\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u7eea\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u5904\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u773c\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u662f\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions.

This paper presents a novel comparative framework for evaluating multilingual semantic robustness by systematically measuring how models handle polysemous words across languages. Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words. Our findings reveal significant variation in semantic robustness across both models and languages, providing a principled ranking system for model comparison without requiring definitive causal attribution of error sources. We contribute both a scalable comparative benchmark for multilingual semantic evaluation and a rigorous validation pipeline$-$critical tools for developing more linguistically balanced AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u8f83\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u8de89\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u542b\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u548c100\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6b67\u4e49\u82f1\u8bed\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6392\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8bed\u8a00\u5e73\u8861\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset.

While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines.

However, less is known about why such mechanisms are present in the first place. Theory suggests that primate decision making mechanisms, and their resultant behavioral abilities, emerged to maximize reward in the face of noisy, temporally evolving information. To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies. These results provide experimental support for key pressures that gave rise to the primate ability to make flexible decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u4f55\u5b58\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u60f3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8fa8\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u6743\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u7075\u6d3b\u6539\u53d8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u5f62\u6210\u7075\u6d3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u538b\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We introduce BiCoLoR, a communication-efficient optimization algorithm that combines two widely used and effective strategies: local training, which increases computation between communication rounds, and compression, which encodes high-dimensional vectors into short bitstreams. While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors.

While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols.

We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.\n  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms.

Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable.

However, current CLAP models face several key limitations. First, they are typically trained on relatively small datasets, often comprising a few million audio samples. Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations.

LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science.

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings.

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints.

Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models.

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms.

This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports. We evaluate multiple local and commercial LLMs under instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting to extract structured procedural information from 414 curated interventional radiology reports authored by nine residents between 2018 and 2024. Model performance is assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, alongside inference latency and token efficiency to estimate operational cost. Results show that both local and commercial models achieve strong extraction performance, with best F1-scores approaching 0.87, while exhibiting different trade-offs between speed and cost. Automation using LLMs has the potential to substantially reduce clerical burden for trainees and improve consistency in case logging.

We conduct extensive evaluations on three popular QA datasets, TruthfulQA, SQuAD and WikiQA, across five Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that our proposed approach consistently improves response quality over standard RAG implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStructured - Semantic RAG (SSRAG)\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SSRAG\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7531\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728TruthfulQA\u3001SQuAD\u548cWikiQA\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSSRAG\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6RAG\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SSRAG\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002"}}

Enumerated chemical spaces aim to reduce this bottleneck by predefining synthesizable regions of chemical space from available building blocks and reliable reactions, yet existing commercial spaces are still limited by long turnaround times, narrow reaction scope, and substantial manual decision-making in route selection and execution.\n  Here we present the first version of onepot CORE, an enumerated chemical space containing 3.4B molecules and corresponding on-demand synthesis product enabled by an automated synthesis platform and an AI chemist, Phil, that designs, executes, and analyzes experiments. onepot CORE is constructed by (i) selecting a reaction set commonly used in medicinal chemistry, (ii) sourcing and curating building blocks from supplier catalogs, (iii) enumerating candidate products, and (iv) applying ML-based feasibility assessment to prioritize compounds for robust execution. In the current release, the space is supported by seven reactions.\n  We describe an end-to-end workflow - from route selection and automated liquid handling through workup and purification. We further report validation across operational metrics (success rate, timelines, purity, and identity), including NMR confirmation for a representative set of synthesized compounds and assay suitability demonstrated using a series of DPP4 inhibitors. Collectively, onepot CORE illustrates a path toward faster, more reliable access to diverse small molecules, supporting accelerated discovery in pharmaceuticals and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u2018\u5236\u9020\u2019\u6b65\u9aa4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u542b34\u4ebf\u5206\u5b50\u7684onepot CORE\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u83b7\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u2018\u5236\u9020\u2019\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u679a\u4e3e\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u83b7\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaonepot CORE\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u5e38\u7528\u53cd\u5e94\u96c6\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u679a\u4e3e\u5019\u9009\u4ea7\u7269\u3001\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NMR\u786e\u8ba4\u5408\u6210\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u7528DPP4\u6291\u5236\u5242\u8bc1\u660e\u6d4b\u5b9a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "onepot CORE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u83b7\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u836f\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

To accelerate the emergence of clinical deployments, we deliver HERMES - an open-source high-performance Python framework for continuous multimodal sensing and AI processing at the edge. It enables synchronized data collection, and realtime streaming inference with user PyTorch models, on commodity computing devices. HERMES is applicable to fixed-lab and free-living environments, of distributed commercial and custom sensors.

Its application on the closed-loop intelligent prosthesis use case illustrates the process of suitable AI model development from the generated constraints and trade-offs.

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs.

Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data.

Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces.

Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms.

However, as human understandings of their personality traits can be affected by their interaction partners' traits, a potential risk is that AI traits may shape and bias users' self-concept of their own traits. To explore the possibility, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that after conversations about personal topics with an LLM-based AI chatbot using GPT-4o default personality traits, users' self-concepts aligned with the AI's measured personality traits. The longer the conversation, the greater the alignment. This alignment led to increased homogeneity in self-concepts among users. We also observed that the degree of self-concept alignment was positively associated with users' conversation enjoyment.

We present a controlled comparison of six fine-tuning objectives -- Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, Conditional Fine-Tuning, Inoculation Prompting, Odds Ratio Preference Optimization, and KL-regularized fine-tuning -- holding data, domain, architecture, and optimization fixed. Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff0c\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u662f\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9886\u57df\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5c01\u95ed\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cbf\u5b89\u5168 - \u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5927\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u5f81\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u5f81\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Easy2Hard\u57fa\u51c6\u7684AMC\u5b50\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u621021\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u3002", "result": "\u96be\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u597d\u4f46\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u53d8\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u5f81\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies.

Here, we introduce TreeWriter, a hierarchical writing system that represents documents as trees and integrates contextual AI support. TreeWriter allows authors to create, save, and refine document outlines at multiple levels, facilitating drafting, understanding, and iterative editing of long documents. A built-in AI agent can dynamically load relevant content, navigate the document hierarchy, and provide context-aware editing suggestions. A within-subject study (N=12) comparing TreeWriter with Google Docs + Gemini on long-document editing and creative writing tasks shows that TreeWriter improves idea exploration/development, AI helpfulness, and perceived authorial control. A two-month field deployment (N=8) further demonstrated that hierarchical organization supports collaborative writing.

To address this, we propose Ensemble Deep Transfer Learning (EDTL), a novel framework that enhances prediction accuracy and data efficiency by integrating transfer learning with an ensemble strategy and a feature alignment layer. EDTL pretrains DNN models on data-rich production lines (source domain) and adapts them to data-limited lines (target domain), reducing dependency on large datasets. Experiments on real-world textile factory datasets show that EDTL improves prediction accuracy by 5.66% and enhances model robustness by 3.96% compared to conventional DNNs, particularly in data-limited scenarios (20%-40% data availability).

However, prior systems struggle to integrate VLMs into practical aerial systems due to orders-of-magnitude frequency mismatch between VLM inference and real-time planning, as well as VLMs' limited 3D scene understanding. They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing approaches to mitigating these risks largely rely on implicit alignment through training or prompting, offering limited transparency and runtime accountability. We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data.

To address this, we introduce VISPA, a training-free pluralistic alignment framework, that enables direct control over value expression by dynamic selection and internal model activation steering. Across extensive empirical studies spanning multiple models and evaluation settings, we show VISPA is performant across all pluralistic alignment modes in healthcare and beyond.

We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5).

The benchmark integrates curated knowledge for over 190K human genes and comprises more than 540K questions covering diverse gene-to-function reasoning scenarios relevant to cell type annotation, functional interpretation, and mechanism-oriented analysis. Motivated by behavioral patterns observed in preliminary examinations, SciHorizon-GENE evaluates LLMs along four biologically critical perspectives: research attention sensitivity, hallucination tendency, answer completeness, and literature influence, explicitly targeting failure modes that limit the safe adoption of LLMs in biological interpretation pipelines. We systematically evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical LLMs, revealing substantial heterogeneity in gene-level reasoning capabilities and persistent challenges in generating faithful, complete, and literature-grounded functional interpretations. Our benchmark establishes a systematic foundation for analyzing LLM behavior at the gene scale and offers insights for model selection and development, with direct relevance to knowledge-enhanced biological interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdSciHorizon - GENE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u56e0\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b58\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u529f\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSciHorizon - GENE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8d8519\u4e07\u4e2a\u57fa\u56e0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d8554\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u56e0\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u56e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u6253\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Our framework implements a complete analysis-synthesis pipeline that extracts spectral features (centroid, bandwidth, contrast), pitch contours via probabilistic YIN (pYIN), and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), mapping them to a unified timbre space for visualization. Audio reconstruction employs the Griffin-Lim phase estimation algorithm applied to mel spectrograms. The accompanying Three.js-based interface provides dual-viewport visualization comparing original and synthesized audio trajectories with independent playback controls. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through comprehensive waveform analysis, spectrogram comparisons, and feature space evaluation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination.

However, relying on generic distortion metrics fails to capture complex human visual perception, often resulting in blurred or unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process.

The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u679029\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f17\u591a\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u679029\u7bc7\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6587\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document. The system extracts text from PDF pages and constructs undirected graphs based on pairwise word relationships, enabling the computation of graph-theoretic features such as node count, edge density, and clustering coefficient. Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis. The proposed approach is scalable, extensible, and designed to support real-world PDF threat intelligence workflows.6", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u53d6PDF\u6587\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610fPDF\u6587\u4ef6\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u884d\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5e03\u5c14\u6807\u5fd7\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210170\u7ef4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cPDF\u5a01\u80c1\u60c5\u62a5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

We present a mechanistic study of how race and ethnicity are represented and operationalized within LLMs. Using two publicly available datasets spanning toxicity-related generation and clinical narrative understanding tasks, we analyze three open-source models with a reproducible interpretability pipeline combining probing, neuron-level attribution, and targeted intervention. We find that demographic information is distributed across internal units with substantial cross-model variation. Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors.

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.

We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\\varepsilon_i,\u03b4_i,\\overline\u0394)$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $\u0394$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design.

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u9047\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faForesight - Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion) \u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ed\u671f\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u53bb\u566a\u635f\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u6293\u63e1\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForeDiffusion\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u566a\u635f\u5931\u548c\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Adroit\u5957\u4ef6\u548cMetaWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cForeDiffusion\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad823%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "ForeDiffusion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We highlight the bidirectional benefits: MAB algorithms address critical LLM challenges, spanning from pre-training to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and personalization. Conversely, LLMs enhance MAB systems by redefining core components such as arm definition and environment modeling, thereby improving decision-making in sequential tasks.

We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations.

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4f1a\u4f7f\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u653f\u7b56\u5f3a\u5236\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u540e\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8d8580\u4e07\u4e2a\u8de8\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u76f2\u6cd5\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u901a\u7528\u8868\u578b\uff0c\u7f55\u89c1\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8868\u5f81\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u5047\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u5fc3\u63a9\u76d6\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e24\u8f6e\u540eAI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u6863\u65e0\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4f53\u79ef\u7f29\u653e\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u653f\u7b56\u5f3a\u5236\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning.

By processing patients` longitudinal health records and bone-related tabular data, our model captures complex, long-range dependencies in disease progression that conventional methods often overlook. We validated our TabTrans model on a retrospective Qatar BioBank (QBB) cohort of 1,382 subjects, comprising 725 men (146 diabetic, 579 healthy) and 657 women (133 diabetic, 524 healthy). The study integrated electronic health records (EHR) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data. To address class imbalance, we employed SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN resampling techniques. The proposed model`s performance is evaluated against conventional machine learning (ML) and generative AI models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic`s constitutional AI), GPT-4 (OpenAI`s generative pre-trained transformer), and Gemini Pro (Google`s multimodal language model). Our TabTrans model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving ROC AUC $\\geq$ 79.7 % for T2DM prediction compared to both generative AI models and conventional ML approaches. Feature interpretation analysis identified key risk indicators, with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume, ward bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), T and Z-scores, and L1-L4 scores emerging as the most important predictors associated with diabetes development in Qatari adults. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of TabTrans for analyzing complex tabular healthcare data, providing a powerful tool for proactive T2DM management and personalized clinical interventions in the Qatari population.\n  Index Terms: tabular transformers, multimodal data, DXA data, diabetes, T2DM, feature interpretation, tabular data", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528TabTrans\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u6790\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728QBB\u961f\u5217\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TabTrans\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u6790\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u548cDXA\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528SMOTE\u548cSMOTE - ENN\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "TabTrans\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0cROC AUC\u226579.7%\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "TabTrans\u5728\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u533b\u7597\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5361\u5854\u5c14\u4eba\u7fa42\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Triple Classification~(TC) aims to determine the validity of triples from KGs. Recently, text-based methods learn entity and relation representations from natural language descriptions, significantly improving the generalization capabilities of TC models and setting new benchmarks in performance. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the effective semantic interaction among different KG components. Second, most approaches adopt single binary classification training objective, leading to insufficient semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SASA}, a novel framework designed to enhance TC models via separated attention mechanism and semantic-aware contrastive learning~(CL). Specifically, we first propose separated attention mechanism to encode triples into decoupled contextual representations and then fuse them through a more effective interactive way. Then, we introduce semantic-aware hierarchical CL as auxiliary training objective to guide models in improving their discriminative capabilities and achieving sufficient semantic learning, considering both local level and global level CL. Experimental results across two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SASA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft \"adversarial news\" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include \"malicious\" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points.

This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer.

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u8b66\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u752846\u4e2a\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u7eed\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u542b\u4e00\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u524d\u7aef\u548c\u2018\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u2019\u67b6\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0Conv1D\u5c42\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0cRMSE\u4e3a0.1189\uff0c\u6bd4LSTM\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad810.6%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f44.73\u5c0f\u65f6\uff1bTransformer\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u5e26\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u5c42\u3001\u7ecf\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u4fee\u6539\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u8b66\u800c\u975e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002"}}

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through two practical use cases: ML-based traffic prediction and scheduled policy enforcement, which validate IntAgent's ability to autonomously fulfill complex network intents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u667a\u80fd\u610f\u56feLLM\u4ee3\u7406IntAgent\uff0c\u6574\u5408NWDAF\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IBN\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7f51\u7edc\u610f\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728NWDAF\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u610f\u56fe\u5de5\u5177\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b3GPP\u5408\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u53caMCP\u5de5\u5177\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u4f8b\uff08ML\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86IntAgent\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210NWDAF\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684IntAgent\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u610f\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u3002"}}

However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \\textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \\textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \\textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \\emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \\textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Existing AI evaluation frameworks, primarily focused on general risks (toxicity, hallucinations, policy violations, etc), may not adequately capture the nuanced risks of LLM-responses in caregiving-contexts. We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses. Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias & Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs on over 20,000 caregiver queries from Reddit and ALZConnected. Rubric-guided refinement consistently reduced risk-components by 45-98% after one iteration across models. This work contributes a methodological approach for developing domain-sensitive, user-centered evaluation frameworks for high-burden contexts.

Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWorldMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7269\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165WorldMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u4e3b\u6784\u5efa\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728EB - ALFRED\u548cEB - Habitat\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWorldMind\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldMind\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

First, we introduce a labeled dataset of 843,000 concept pairs spanning synonymy, antonymy, and co-hyponymy, constructed via Gemini 2.5-Flash LLM augmentation and verified using human-curated dictionary resources.

Third, we introduce a novel soft-to-hard clustering algorithm that mitigates semantic drift preventing erroneous transitive chains (e.g., hot -> spicy -> pain -> depression) while simultaneously resolving polysemy. Our approach employs a topology-aware two-stage expansion-pruning procedure with topological voting, ensuring that each term is assigned to exactly one semantically coherent cluster.

Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision.

Over multiple revision turns, even the best-performing agents leave significant headroom, as they continue to disrupt content outside the feedback's scope and fail to preserve earlier edits.

In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising mesh free alternative, enabling the approximation of PDE solutions in tens to thousands of dimensions. This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions.

However, their formulation-predicting one part of a sequence from another within a single-step dependency-limits modeling depth and often yields lower sample quality and stability than autoregressive (AR) models. To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding.

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

In clinical practice, conservative acceleration factors are chosen because no mechanism exists to automatically assess the diagnostic quality of undersampled reconstructions. This work introduces a general framework for pixel-wise uncertainty quantification in parallel MRI reconstructions, enabling automatic identification of unreliable regions without access to any ground-truth reference image. Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual).

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9Meta\u4ed8\u8d39\u5e7f\u544a\u548cBluesky\u516c\u5f00\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u8bdd\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u53f0\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u5019\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u6c14\u5019\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u533a\u5206\u673a\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e3b\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u805a\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u53f0\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d9\u4e8b\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u6c14\u653b\u51fb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u964d\u96e8\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u96e8\u6ef4\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u6c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5149\u7167\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u96e8\u6ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u7ed9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue. MultiST yields spatial domains with clearer and more coherent boundaries than existing methods, leading to more stable pseudotime trajectories and more biologically interpretable cell-cell interaction patterns.

While automated jailbreaking methods like GCG [Zou et al., 2023] remain effective, they often require substantial computational resources and specific expertise. We introduce \"sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., \"Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting.

Four predictor variables were examined: absolute difference from the aggregate, forecast value, days prior to question close, and mean standardized Brier score. Results indicated the recalibrated aggregate achieved the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.985), followed by both types of BNs, then the logistic regression models. Performance of the BNs was likely harmed by reduced information from the discretization process and violation of the assumption of linearity likely harmed the logistic regression models.

The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models.

As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses.

In this paper, we address classifying points in the $d$-dimensional Hilbert polygonal metric. The Hilbert metric is a generalization of the Cayley-Klein hyperbolic distance to arbitrary convex bodies and has a diverse range of applications in machine learning and convex geometry. We first present an efficient LP-based algorithm in the metric for the large-margin SVM problem. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial to the number of points, bounding facets, and dimension.

It can be seen as a generalization of zero-shot learning, where the new classes are not known a priori, hence involving the active discovery of new classes. While zero-shot learning has been extensively studied in text classification, especially with the emergence of pre-trained language models, open-set learning and discovery is a comparatively new setup for the text domain. To this end, we introduce the first multilingual open-set learning and discovery (MOSLD) benchmark for text categorization by topic, comprising 960K data samples across 12 languages. To construct the benchmark, we (i) rearrange existing datasets and (ii) collect new data samples from the news domain.

Study-level CT triage requires calibrated predictions with localized evidence; however, off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLM) struggle with 3D anatomy, protocol shifts, and noisy report supervision. This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85. Together, these results deliver state-of-the-art supervised classification performance across both chest and abdomen CT under a unified evaluation protocol.

Models achieve perfect accuracy on factual questions and 84-90% on seen tasks. However, accuracy drops sharply on unseen problems (by 30-64%), with failures stemming from systematic misinterpretation of language constraints, incorrect handling of Kleene-star semantics, and a failure to preserve global consistency. We evaluate a three-stage hint protocol that enables correction of shallow errors but does not reliably resolve globally inconsistent or structurally flawed automata.

Many image smoothing algorithms rely on computing local window statistics or solving an optimization problem.

Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\\ell_0$ ``norm\", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver.

Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs.

The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space.

Twelve surgical professionals completed pilot sessions at the 2024 SAGES conference, rating VORTeX as intuitive, immersive, and valuable for developing teamwork and communication. The LLM consistently produced interpretable communication networks reflecting expected operative hierarchies, with surgeons as central integrators, nurses as initiators, and anesthesiologists as balanced intermediaries.

Vincent Poor", "Wenyi Zhang"], "title": "An Elementary Approach to Scheduling in Generative Diffusion Models", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "An elementary approach to characterizing the impact of noise scheduling and time discretization in generative diffusion models is developed. Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0eKL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6b65\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u9009\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u523b\u753b\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\u8f68\u8ff9\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528Euler - Maclaurin\u5c55\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6b65\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5f97\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u9075\u5faa\u6b63\u5207\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7cfb\u6570\u7531\u6e90\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u7d27\u5f20\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6240\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790 - \u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u9006\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5fae\u5e8f\u5217\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u9006\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u9006\u5e76\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fed\u4ee3\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5c94\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8ekNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u5fae\u5e8f\u5217\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u4fe1\u606f\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7406\u8bba\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u5206\u5e03\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u7acb\u5fae\u5e8f\u5217\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u6c42\u6839\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u8bca\u65ad\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Experiments demonstrate that CauScientist substantially outperforms purely data-driven baselines, achieving up to 53.8% F1 score improvement and enhancing recall from 35.0% to 100.0%.

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u96c6\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u590d\u6742\u591a\u969c\u788d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u9886\u5bfc - \u8ddf\u968f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u70b9\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5728Nvidia Isaac Sim\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3DRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4ece\u865a\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging the global control capabilities of a geostationary (GEO)-resident software-defined networking (SDN) controller, we introduce opportunistic routing, which aims to minimize delivery delay by forwarding packets to any currently available ground gateways rather than fixed destinations. This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay.

We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts.

Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.\n  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability.

We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation.

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing.

We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost.

However, the impact of this framing bias on LLM-based evaluation, where models are expected to make stable and impartial judgments, remains largely underexplored. Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks.

The efficiency of symbolic computation is largely constrained by such deep computations in high dimension. This creates a fundamental barrier on labelled data acquisition if leveraging supervised deep learning to accelerate symbolic computation. Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is a pillar symbolic computation method for reasoning with first-order logic formulas over reals with many applications in formal verification and automatic theorem proving. Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency. Impeded by the difficulty to acquire abundant labelled data, existing learning-based approaches are only competitive with the best expert-based heuristics. In this work, we address this problem by designing a series of intimately connected tasks for which a large amount of annotated data can be easily obtained. We pre-train a Transformer model with these data and then fine-tune it on the datasets for CAD ordering.

Prevailing end-to-end models tightly couple feature extraction with classification, overlooking the inherent time-frequency sparsity of CSI and leading to redundancy and poor generalization. To address this, this paper proposes a lightweight feature preprocessing module--the Variational Dual-path Attention Network (VDAN). It performs structured feature refinement through frequency-domain filtering and temporal detection. Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise. The design principles of the module are explained from the perspectives of the information bottleneck and regularization.

This paper addresses flood detection, a critical application for hazard management, by developing an onboard change detection system that operates within the memory and computational limits of small satellites. We propose History Injection mechanism for Transformer models (HiT), that maintains historical context from previous observations while reducing data storage by over 99\\% of original image size. Moreover, testing on the STTORM-CD flood dataset confirms that the HiT mechanism within the Prithvi-tiny foundation model maintains detection accuracy compared to the bitemporal baseline.

We leverage a hierarchical sparse autoencoder and a foundation model with strong semantic representations to automatically extract concepts at various granularities. Examining local co-occurrence dependencies of concepts allows us to define concept relationships. Through these relations we further improve concept naming and obtain richer explanations.

LLMs Belief Resistance Check Through Strategic Persuasive Conversation Interventions", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in various question-answering tasks. However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that smaller models exhibit extreme compliance, with over 80% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4).

An Investigation into Language Bias of Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u65f6\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u7cfb\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u7531\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u9879\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u5426\u7531\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u4e2d\u6b27\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u4e3b\u9898\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u5224\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u82f1\u8bed\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff1b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u5173\u8054\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u7528\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts.

We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic \"Context Collapse\" failure mode.

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context.

However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations.

Despite its critical role, reverse screening remains challenging because accurately capturing interactions between a small molecule and structurally diverse proteins is inherently complex, and conventional step-wise workflows often propagate errors across decoupled steps such as target structure modeling, pocket identification, docking, and scoring. Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules. Compared with conventional reverse docking, our method improves screening accuracy and demonstrates enhanced structural fidelity, binding-site precision, and target prioritization.

However, in the non-iid setting, the global model experiences client drift, which can seriously affect the final performance of the model. Previous methods tend to correct the global model that has already deviated based on the loss function or gradient, overlooking the impact of the client samples. In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method. Meanwhile, we scale our method to real and complex scenarios, allowing different clients to adopt various methods, and extend our framework to further improve performance.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to address the uVCIL.

We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features.

We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality.

The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6d41\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d", "motivation": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u673a\u5236\u5185\u8868\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8457\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1"}}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately.

In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \\textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \\textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance.

However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation. We introduce Explanation Network (ExpNet), a lightweight neural network that learns an explicit mapping from transformer attention patterns to token-level importance scores.

Second, ARL equips models with the ability to autonomously generate and utilize these retrospective summaries during inference, thereby establishing a recursive memory mechanism across paragraphs. Experimental results show substantial gains, with ARL achieving a 26.8% improvement on RULER and a 9.44% improvement on LongBench.

Additionally, online buyers rarely see undercarriage photos. We present an end-to-end pipeline that utilizes a three-camera rig to capture videos of the undercarriage as the vehicle drives over it, and produces an interactive 3D model of the undercarriage. The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines. These point clouds seed the Gaussian splatting process to generate photorealistic undercarriage models that render in real-time.

This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5e73\u53f0\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8ba9\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u754c\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8eGrounding DINO\u7684MediaPipe\u548cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u7528VLA\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u7528Grounding DINO\u548c\u52a8\u6001A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MediaPipe\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u6b27\u6c0f\u548c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.164m\u30010.070m\u548c0.084m\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues. However, LLM-generated code that appears functionally sound may embed security flaws which could induce catastrophic damages after deployment. This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation.

It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning.

Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios.

While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect \"epiphany moments\" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer.

DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost.

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels.

Despite their success, AR models are inherently constrained by a causal bottleneck that limits global structural foresight and iterative refinement. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5c55\u5f00\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6218\u7565\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f6c\u5411\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u751f\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\uff0c\u4e3a\u6316\u6398\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u963b\u788dDLMs\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5341\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7531\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u56db\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u6784\u6210\u7684\u6218\u7565\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5411\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u751f\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6c\u5411\u6269\u6563\u539f\u751f\u751f\u6001\u4ee5\u7a81\u7834\u56e0\u679c\u754c\u9650\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u5907\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u65e0\u7f1d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Its hierarchical encoder learns rich node representations by combining a patch-level Transformer with a supervoxel-level Graph Attention Network, jointly modeling fine-grained intra-region features and broader inter-regional dependencies. This design concentrates all learnable capacity on feature encoding and provides inherent, dual-scale explainability from the patch to the region level. To validate the framework's flexibility, we trained two specialized models on the BraTS dataset: one for node-level classification and one for tumor proportion regression. Both models achieved strong performance, with the classification model achieving a F1-score of 0.875 and the regression model a MAE of 0.028, confirming the encoder's ability to learn discriminative and localized features.

While prior methods improve spatial adherence using 2D cues or iterative copy-warp-paste strategies, they often distort object geometry and fail to preserve consistency across edits. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence.

To address this limitation, we introduce XCR-Bench, a Cross(X)-Cultural Reasoning Benchmark consisting of 4.9k parallel sentences and 1,098 unique CSIs, spanning three distinct reasoning tasks with corresponding evaluation metrics.

Our findings show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit consistent weaknesses in identifying and adapting CSIs related to social etiquette and cultural reference.

In this work, we propose a pretraining-free diffusion-based approach for synthetic text generation that frames bias mitigation as a style transfer problem. Using the CARMA Arabic mental health corpus, which exhibits a substantial gender imbalance, we focus on male-to-female style transfer to augment underrepresented female-authored content. We construct five datasets capturing varying linguistic and semantic aspects of gender expression in Arabic and train separate diffusion models for each setting. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate consistently high semantic fidelity between source and generated text, alongside meaningful surface-level stylistic divergence, while qualitative analysis confirms linguistically plausible gender transformations.

Using rigorous automated filtering methods and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, we demonstrate that LLMs adapted with our synthetic dataset significantly outperform their baseline counterparts on German legal question answering tasks. Our results highlight the feasibility of using carefully designed synthetic data as a robust alternative to manual annotation in high-stakes, knowledge-intensive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5fb7\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u7ecf\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9700\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u5fb7\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5fb7\u56fd\u6743\u5a01\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u6cd5\u5f8b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fb7\u56fd\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task (\"does any value appear?\") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5c0f\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u8c03\u4f18\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e3a\u6709\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u5ba3\u8a00\u7684\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53e5\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u4ef7\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5f00\u5c55\u4e8c\u5143\u9053\u5fb7\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eDeBERTa - base\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6/\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548cQLoRA\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u672a\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8f6f\u6295\u7968\u76d1\u7763\u96c6\u6210\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u8fbe0.332\uff0c\u8d85\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5148\u524d\u82f1\u8bed\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5c0f\u96c6\u6210\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u5c42\u6b21\u95e8\u63a7\u76ca\u5904\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5728\u5355GPU 8GB\u7ea6\u675f\u548c7 - 9B\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u8c03\u4f18\u76d1\u7763\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u662f\u6709\u529b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ef7\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u6863\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse--where agents revert to generic, homogenized assistant behaviors--and social sycophancy, which produces redundant, non-constructive dialogue. We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective socio-collaborative companions. MASCOT introduces a novel bi-level optimization strategy to harmonize individual and collective behaviors: 1) Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, an RLAIF-driven pipeline that finetunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss; and 2) Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, a meta-policy guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate that MASCOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of up to +14.1 in Persona Consistency and +10.6 in Social Contribution.

Building on this capability, we develop a scalable pseudo-labeling pipeline for large-scale video matting and construct the Matting Anything in Video (MA-V) dataset, which offers high-quality matting annotations for more than 50K real-world videos spanning diverse scenes and motions. To validate the effectiveness of this dataset, we fine-tune the SAM2 model on MA-V to obtain SAM2-Matte, which outperforms the same model trained on existing matting datasets in terms of robustness on in-the-wild videos.
