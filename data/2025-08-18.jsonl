In any\nfixed slot, if a single device sends a packet, it succeeds; however, if two or\nmore devices send, then there is a collision and none of the corresponding\npackets succeed. For the static version of wakeup, all packets are initially\nactive (i.e., can send and listen on the channel); for the dynamic version, the\npackets become active at arbitrary times. In both versions, the goal is to\nsuccessfully send a single packet.\n  Prior results on wakeup have largely focused on the number of slots until the\nfirst success; that is, the latency.

With advancements in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent\nsystems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable\napproach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this\ndomain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,\nincluding biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on\nLLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced\nEvaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating\nassessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines\nLLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted\nevaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics\nthat emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans.

In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only\nexhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and\npreserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several\nasylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment\npredictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host\ncountry, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions\nfor many and often small source locations. However, this task is made\nchallenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:\nthe presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between\nthem, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper\nintroduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method\nthat combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive\npooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and\npreserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that\nclarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and\ndata quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5\nlarge-scale datasets.

In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features.

In this paper, we evaluate the extent\nto which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when\ninterpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey\nstudy with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed\nvision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and\nrecognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct\nprompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,\nvarying the included information on vision information and example image\nresponses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and\nparticipants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer\nbeyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in\nlow agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'\nresponses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example\nimage responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both\nsignificantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001).

While\nexisting approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and\nreweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself\nby addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly\nfocusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient\ndescent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across\ndifferent classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates\nunder-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,\nHGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,\nextra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning\nmodels utilizing gradient descent for optimization.

However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

To make this learning process\nstable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms\nfor both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy\nimprovement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning\nexclusively from successful trajectories.

Visuomotor learning offers a promising\nalternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low\nsignal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and\nmillimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This\npaper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor\npolicies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a\nsingle stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic\ngrasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical\nobjects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything\nfor Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.\nGASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception\npipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for\nsafe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization\nfor sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based\nand ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.\nExtensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both\nsettings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse\ndisturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness."}

We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split\nby perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed\nacross six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic\nlabor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute\nunit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for\nevery statement, then define a statement-level association score as the\ndifference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean\ncosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger\nassociation with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association\nwith the female set.

A lightweight channel attention module,\ntermed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the\nadaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.\nAdditionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function\nto enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.\nUnder CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum\nclassification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,\nexhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image\nclassification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible\nand efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging\nanalysis models."}

Unlike\ntraditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the\ndrift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data\nwithout strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in\nscientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly\ncomplex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized\nnegative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory\nsegments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte\nCarlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized\nempirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a\nfinite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer\ntheorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a\nhybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify\nsignificant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important\ntheoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM\nsequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of\nthe drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is\nbroadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under\nobservational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a series of numerical experiments."}
