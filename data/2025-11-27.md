### [1] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨大语言模型自动重构层次结构以提升双曲嵌入质量，实验表明重构后层次结构效果更好且具备可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为帮助知识工程师重组层次知识，研究大语言模型是否能自动重构层次结构以满足双曲嵌入的标准。

Method: 提出基于提示的方法，利用大语言模型根据双曲嵌入的已知要求转换现有层次结构。

Result: 在16个不同层次结构的实验中，大语言模型重构的层次结构在多个标准嵌入质量指标上始终产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。

Conclusion: 大语言模型引导的层次结构重构能产生高质量双曲嵌入，且能为知识工程师提供可解释的重组理由。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

TL;DR: 为解决现有生成式AI安全评估数据集英语为主、缺乏韩语多模态数据的问题，引入AssurAI韩语多模态数据集并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全数据集以英语为主，无法捕捉韩语等非英语社会文化背景下的特定风险，且多限于文本模态，需新数据集评估生成式AI安全。

Method: 定义35种AI风险因素分类；构建并发布含11480个多模态实例的AssurAI数据集；采用严格质量控制流程。

Result: 试点研究验证了AssurAI评估近期大语言模型安全性的有效性。

Conclusion: 发布AssurAI数据集，助力韩国社区开发更安全可靠的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

### [3] [$A^2Flow:$ Automating Agentic Workflow Generation via Self-Adaptive Abstraction Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20693)
*Mingming Zhao,Xiaokang Wei,Yuanqi Shao,Kaiwen Zhou,Lin Yang,Siwei Rao,Junhui Zhan,Zhitang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代理工作流设计方法依赖手动预定义算子，限制泛化性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出$A^2Flow$框架，采用三阶段算子提取过程，并用算子记忆机制增强节点级工作流搜索。

Result: 在通用和具身基准测试中，$A^2Flow$平均性能提升2.4%和19.3%，资源使用减少37%。

Conclusion: $A^2Flow$框架有效，能在不手动预定义算子的情况下构建工作流，提升性能并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 通过系统工程原理分解工作流在需要演绎推理的问题上表现优于直接提示。

Conclusion: 在日球物理学科学推理中，基于系统工程原理分解工作流的方法更适合需要演绎推理的问题。

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI/ML存在放大人类偏见等问题，且不同方法因底层假设不同难以结合，需借助系统动力学因果模型推动负责任AI/ML发展。

Method: 将系统动力学和结构方程建模整合到一个通用数学框架。

Result: 文中未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 文中未提及明确结论。

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

### [8] [ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005)
*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ICPO方法解决现有RLVR方法问题，实验表明其比GRPO能稳定提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和探索低效等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵坍缩。

Method: 提出ICPO方法，通过比较同一输入提示下多个响应的相对生成概率计算偏好优势分数，并与可验证奖励结合来引导探索过程。

Result: 偏好优势分数能缓解粗粒度奖励和奖励噪声问题，抑制过度自信错误，增强被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止过拟合。

Conclusion: 在多个基准测试中，ICPO比GRPO能稳定提升推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文全面分析多模态思维链推理，评估其在多个数据集上的效果，揭示视觉集成等影响，为多模态推理系统提供见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法在不同领域的泛化性研究不足，需评估其在更广泛数据集上的有效性。

Method: 采用Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，分离理由生成和答案推断，通过门控融合机制将视觉特征与基于T5的语言模型集成，并进行系统的消融研究。

Result: 视觉集成显著减少理由生成中的幻觉，但思维链推理的有效性因问题类型而异，常识推理挑战较大。

Conclusion: 为实现多模态推理系统的研究人员提供实用见解，指出跨领域泛化未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Agentic AI Wi-Fi框架解决现有MAPC协议无法适应动态网络条件问题，模拟显示该框架表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAPC协议依赖静态规则，难以适应动态网络条件，如不同干扰水平和拓扑结构。

Method: 提出Agentic AI Wi-Fi框架，将每个接入点建模为自主大语言模型智能体，通过认知工作流程进行自然语言对话，结合记忆、反思和工具使用实时协作推理网络状态并协商自适应协调策略。

Result: 综合模拟结果表明，该框架能适应多样动态网络环境，显著优于现有空间复用基线。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力成为未来无线网络强大且智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: 开发OpenApps生态系统评估多模态代理跨应用变体的可靠性，发现跨变体可靠性波动大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估依赖固定环境，无法衡量代理在应用变体中的可靠性，需解决此盲点。

Method: 开发OpenApps生态系统，用六个可配置外观和内容的应用，在单CPU上运行，对七个多模态代理进行超10000次独立评估。

Result: 固定应用内可靠性较稳定，但跨应用变体可靠性波动大，任务成功率波动超50%，代理行为因环境配置而异。

Conclusion: 强调了在应用变体新维度上测量可靠性的重要性。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

TL;DR: 介绍了RILKE方法用于大语言模型终身知识控制，评估显示其有效可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常产生错误或过时内容，高效准确更新知识且避免高成本再训练是挑战，尤其是终身场景下的复杂非结构化知识。

Method: 引入RILKE方法，将知识控制视为模型表示空间内的干预，学习释义鲁棒和编辑局部化模块，推理时用查询自适应路由器选择模块。

Result: 在知识编辑基准测试中，RILKE可扩展到大规模数据集，有高编辑成功率、强释义泛化能力，以适度内存开销保留通用效用。

Conclusion: RILKE是大语言模型终身知识控制的有效可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提框架可计算最优组合解释，改进的束搜索变体有更好性能和灵活性。

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Conclusion: 通过ENACT基准可评估视觉语言模型具身认知能力，模型在具身认知方面与人类有差距且有特定表现。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在程序技能学习指导中产出的解释缺乏结构的问题。

Method: 构建AI辅导系统Ivy，将符号化的TMK模型与生成解释层（LLM）结合，利用TMK编码因果转换、目标层次和问题分解来约束LLM。

Result: 通过与GPT和检索增强的GPT基线对比，符号约束能持续提升“如何”和“为何”问题解释的结构质量。

Conclusion: 展示了一种可扩展的教育AI方法，能增强智能辅导系统中AI生成解释的教学价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

TL;DR: 介绍了结合对抗性LLM代理和SMT求解器支持的证明的L4M框架，该框架在处理法律问题上表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的系统缺乏法理原则所需的保障，无法很好地处理法律问题的实质和形式合理性。

Method: 引入L4M框架，包括法规形式化、双事实和法规提取、求解器为中心的裁决三个阶段。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，系统超越了包括GPT - o4 - mini、DeepSeek - V3和Claude 4等先进大语言模型以及现有最先进的法律人工智能基线。

Conclusion: L4M框架能结合自然语言的解释灵活性和符号验证的严谨性，为法律问题提供严谨且可解释的符号论证。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

TL;DR: 提出OVOD - Agent，将被动类别匹配转为主动视觉推理和自进化检测，在COCO和LVIS上实验有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放式词汇目标检测（OVOD）方法推理限于固定类别名，存在多模态训练和单模态推理差距，且文本空间未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出OVOD - Agent，借鉴思维链范式扩展文本优化为可解释的视觉思维链；将视觉上下文转换建模为弱马尔可夫决策过程；用Bandit模块生成探索信号；集成马尔可夫转移矩阵和Bandit轨迹优化自监督奖励模型。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS上实验表明，OVOD - Agent在各OVOD骨干网络上有持续改进，尤其对稀有类别。

Conclusion: 所提OVOD - Agent框架有效。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 将Halpern和Pearl基于因果模型的因果定义推广到更多模型，处理原定义无法处理的情况。

Method: 抽象原定义，提取关键特征。

Result: 定义可用于更广泛模型，能处理含析取、否定等公式，还可拓展到解释的抽象定义。

Conclusion: 抽象定义有诸多好处，还加深对因果模型定义特征的理解。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的Web代理在导航复杂网页时，因DOM结构大，现有策略无法平衡精度和可扩展性。

Method: 引入Prune4Web范式，采用DOM树剪枝编程，生成Python脚本过滤DOM元素；提出数据标注管道和两阶段对话训练策略。

Result: 实现候选元素25 - 50倍减少，低级别接地任务准确率从46.8%提升到88.28%。

Conclusion: Prune4Web在实际Web自动化中有效，达到了当前最优性能。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Motivation: 传统药物开发中，计算机预测药物再利用候选药物有挑战，现有算法和工具碎片化、数据处理难且工作流集成差。

Method: 基于集成系统医学知识图谱NeDRex构建ChatDRex，提供自然语言访问，集成多种生物信息智能体，有灵活多智能体设计和专用推理模块。

Result: ChatDRex可让无计算机科学专业知识的医生和研究人员用自然语言控制复杂分析。

Conclusion: ChatDRex使生物信息学资源更加普及，能加速新疗法发现，推动个性化医疗和转化研究。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Result: 在AI2 - THOR和VirtualHome上实验，对不安全任务拒绝率超90%，安全任务拒绝率低，在安全和执行效率上超现有方法。

Conclusion: 工作为构建可信具身智能体提供了可扩展、与模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Conclusion: 建立了首个测量多模态大语言模型分层空间认知的系统框架，为未来空间智能系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 数学问题自验证可提高语言模型输出可靠性和性能，悲观验证研究有助于提升语言模型数学能力。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

Motivation: 若语言模型在专业场景不能可靠披露AI身份，用户无法信任其能力边界，研究高风险领域模型自我透明度。

Method: 采用普通花园设计，对16个开放权重模型（4B - 671B参数）进行19200次试验。

Result: 模型有领域特定不一致性，披露率2.8% - 73.6%，模型身份比参数数量更能预测行为，推理优化会抑制自我透明度，贝叶斯验证结果稳健。

Conclusion: 透明度反映训练因素而非规模，组织不能假定安全属性可迁移，需进行行为设计和实证验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在规划和状态推理方面的能力。

Method: 使用8谜题测试四个模型，采用常见提示条件和分层纠正反馈，还使用外部移动验证器。

Result: 部分模型 - 提示组合经反馈提高成功率，但存在运行长、计算贵等问题；有外部验证器时模型仍无法解谜；模型存在内部状态表示脆弱和启发式规划弱的问题。

Conclusion: 无代码解释器等外部工具时，当前大语言模型在规划方面有很大局限，后续需有维护显式状态和进行结构化搜索的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs独立解决问题常重复错误，基于轨迹的记忆有简洁性偏差且单模态，与人类认知不符。

Method: 引入ViLoMem，分别编码视觉干扰模式和逻辑推理错误，按增长 - 精炼原则积累和更新多模态语义知识。

Conclusion: 双流记忆结合明确的干扰 - 幻觉分离是必要的，错误感知的多模态记忆对终身和跨领域学习有价值。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning. Our project page will be available at https://weihao-bo.github.io/ViLoMeo-page.

Method: 优化喷嘴形状以最小化压力损失，建立优化框架，比较温度相关剪切变稀粘性模型和等温粘弹性模型。

Abstract: Purpose: In fused deposition modeling (FDM), the nozzle plays a critical role in enabling high printing speeds while maintaining precision. Despite its importance, most applications still rely on standard nozzle designs. This work investigates the influence of nozzle geometry on pressure loss inside the nozzle, a key factor in high-speed printing performance. Design/methodology/approach: We focus on optimizing the nozzle shape to minimize the pressure loss and establish a framework that allows both sim- ple angle-based optimization and more advanced spline-based parametrization. To model the polymer melt flow, we compare two constitutive descriptions commonly employed in the literature: a temperature-dependent, shear-thinning viscous model and an isothermal viscoelastic model. Findings: For the viscous model, the optimal half-opening angle exhibits a strong dependence on the feeding rate, with higher rates favoring half-opening angles near 30°, whereas lower rates are more efficient at larger angles. In con- trast, the viscoelastic model predicts a weaker dependence of the optimal angle on the feeding rate. For both models, spline-based parametrization yields only marginal improvements over angle optimization in terms of reducing pressure loss. Originality/value: This paper presents a comparative study of FDM nozzle shape optimization using different simulation models. We introduce a flexible optimization framework that accommodates both simple and advanced geomet- ric parametrizations. The results highlight the impact of model choice on the optimal nozzle geometry and provide support for improving nozzle design in high-speed printing applications.

Motivation: 现有航空航天数据集多关注2D翼型，忽略3D现象，将汽车空气动力学神经替代方法扩展到航空航天跨音速区域有挑战，需填补此空白。

Method: 创建跨音速区域3D机翼CFD模拟新数据集，评估包括Transolver和AB - UPT在内的神经替代模型的分布外泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread use of neural surrogates in automotive aerodynamics, enabled by datasets such as DrivAerML and DrivAerNet++, has primarily focused on bluff-body flows with large wakes. Extending these methods to aerospace, particularly in the transonic regime, remains challenging due to the high level of non-linearity of compressible flows and 3D effects such as wingtip vortices. Existing aerospace datasets predominantly focus on 2D airfoils, neglecting these critical 3D phenomena. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of CFD simulations for 3D wings in the transonic regime. The dataset comprises volumetric and surface-level fields for around $30,000$ samples with unique geometry and inflow conditions. This allows computation of lift and drag coefficients, providing a foundation for data-driven aerodynamic optimization of the drag-lift Pareto front. We evaluate several state-of-the-art neural surrogates on our dataset, including Transolver and AB-UPT, focusing on their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over geometry and inflow variations. AB-UPT demonstrates strong performance for transonic flowfields and reproduces physically consistent drag-lift Pareto fronts even for unseen wing configurations. Our results demonstrate that AB-UPT can approximate drag-lift Pareto fronts for unseen geometries, highlighting its potential as an efficient and effective tool for rapid aerodynamic design exploration. To facilitate future research, we open-source our dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EmmiAI/Emmi-Wing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据库环境中深度学习推理解决方案存在开发开销大、计算成本高和DBMS集成性差等问题。

Method: 引入专用模式和多维张量数据类型支持模型存储；设计两阶段迁移学习框架进行模型选择；提出预嵌入和基于DAG的批处理管道优化推理吞吐量。

Result: MorphingDB在九个公共数据集上性能优于AI原生DBMS和AutoML平台。

Conclusion: MorphingDB在模型选择的准确性、资源消耗和时间成本间取得平衡，提升了吞吐量和资源效率。

Abstract: The increasing demand for deep neural inference within database environments has driven the emergence of AI-native DBMSs. However, existing solutions either rely on model-centric designs requiring developers to manually select, configure, and maintain models, resulting in high development overhead, or adopt task-centric AutoML approaches with high computational costs and poor DBMS integration. We present MorphingDB, a task-centric AI-native DBMS that automates model storage, selection, and inference within PostgreSQL. To enable flexible, I/O-efficient storage of deep learning models, we first introduce specialized schemas and multi-dimensional tensor data types to support BLOB-based all-in-one and decoupled model storage. Then we design a transfer learning framework for model selection in two phases, which builds a transferability subspace via offline embedding of historical tasks and employs online projection through feature-aware mapping for real-time tasks. To further optimize inference throughput, we propose pre-embedding with vectoring sharing to eliminate redundant computations and DAG-based batch pipelines with cost-aware scheduling to minimize the inference time. Implemented as a PostgreSQL extension with LibTorch, MorphingDB outperforms AI-native DBMSs (EvaDB, Madlib, GaussML) and AutoML platforms (AutoGluon, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn) across nine public datasets, encompassing series, NLP, and image tasks. Our evaluation demonstrates a robust balance among accuracy, resource consumption, and time cost in model selection and significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出混合内存索引结构HIRE，结合传统索引与模型预测的优势，在多数据集实验中表现优于现有索引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型索引存在高尾延迟、范围查询性能不佳和跨工作负载效果不一致的问题，需要新的索引结构解决。

Method: HIRE结合传统索引与模型预测，采用混合叶节点、模型加速内部节点、重校准机制和批量加载算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集实验中，HIRE在范围查询吞吐量、尾延迟和整体稳定性上优于现有学习型索引和传统结构，在混合工作负载下吞吐量最高提升41.7倍，尾延迟最多降低98%。

Conclusion: HIRE能稳定高效地提升数据库数据检索和更新性能。

Abstract: Indexes are critical for efficient data retrieval and updates in modern databases. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of learned indexes, which model the cumulative distribution function of data to predict search positions and accelerate query processing. While learned indexes substantially outperform traditional structures for point lookups, they often suffer from high tail latency, suboptimal range query performance, and inconsistent effectiveness across diverse workloads. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HIRE, a hybrid in-memory index structure designed to deliver efficient performance consistently. HIRE combines the structural and performance robustness of traditional indexes with the predictive power of model-based prediction to reduce search overhead while maintaining worst-case stability. Specifically, it employs (1) hybrid leaf nodes adaptive to varying data distributions and workloads, (2) model-accelerated internal nodes augmented by log-based updates for efficient updates, (3) a nonblocking, cost-driven recalibration mechanism for dynamic data, and (4) an inter-level optimized bulk-loading algorithm accounting for leaf and internal-node errors. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that HIRE outperforms both state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional structures in range-query throughput, tail latency, and overall stability. Compared to state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional indexes, HIRE achieves up to 41.7$\times$ higher throughput under mixed workloads, reduces tail latency by up to 98% across varying scenarios.

Abstract: Handling missing data is a central challenge in data-driven analysis. Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.

Result: 主机和虚拟机级的冗余显著提高了可用性并减少了预期停机时间。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可为私有云可用性评估和基础设施设计决策提供支持。

Abstract: Cloud-based storage platforms are becoming more common in both academic and business settings due to their flexible access to data and support for collaborative functionalities. As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime. The proposed approach provides a method to evaluate the availability of a private cloud and support infrastructure design decisions.

Conclusion: Spira能有效利用体素坐标特性，显著提升稀疏卷积引擎性能。

Abstract: Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.

Abstract: Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.

Motivation: 现有代理工作流大规模服务计算成本高，且配置选择方法不适合工作流异构和长时间执行，系统负载波动会使固定配置很快变得不理想。

Method: 将问题解耦为一次性路由步骤和每阶段调度器两部分，并引入新策略加速。

Result: 在不同工作流和模型族中，最大服务吞吐量提高50.0 - 217.0%，在峰值请求率下中位延迟降低32.5 - 78.9%，并保持与最昂贵配置相当的准确性。

Conclusion: Aragog系统能有效适应运行时动态，提升工作流服务性能。

Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.

Method: 引入数据冗余减少内存访问分散，提出基于局部性指标的分析模型预测加速趋势。

Result: 内核加速最高达7倍，端到端应用加速达1.04倍，模型能可靠捕捉不同问题规模和密度下的性能趋势。

Conclusion: 只要局部性提升收益超过数据移动成本，数据冗余可增强P2P算子的GPU性能，且该技术可少量修改代码注入现有实现。

Abstract: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代大语言模型拆分预填充和解码阶段到不同GPU，但工作负载异质性导致实例间生产者 - 消费者不平衡。

Method: 提出DOPD系统，基于实时负载监控调整实例分配以实现最优预填充 - 解码比例，并结合适当的请求调度策略。

Result: 与vLLM和DistServe相比，DOPD将系统整体吞吐量提高1.5倍，P90首次令牌时间降低67.5%，P90每个输出令牌时间降低22.8%，动态调整技术用较少额外资源使SLO达成率超99%。

Conclusion: DOPD能有效解决预填充和解码实例间的不平衡，缓解资源分配不匹配问题。

Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.

Motivation: 传统RDMA引擎不能容忍页错误，现有避免页错误的方法存在编程复杂、内存利用低效等问题。

Method: 实现集成于ExaNeSt项目DMA引擎的页错误处理机制，检测由ARM SMMU完成，通过软硬件结合解决，需修改Linux SMMU驱动、开发新软件库、更改DMA引擎硬件和调整调度逻辑。

Result: 在ExaNeSt的QFDB上进行了实验。

Conclusion: 评估了所提出的机制，与其他方法对比并讨论了其优势。

Abstract: Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.
  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.
  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.
  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.

Abstract: AI/ML model cards can contain a benchmarked evaluation of an AI/ML model against intended use but a one time assessment during model training does not get at how and where a model is actually used over its lifetime. Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.

Result: 与基于全重计算的基线相比，MemFine减少激活内存48.03%，提高吞吐量4.42%。

Conclusion: MemFine能实现内存受限GPU上的稳定大规模MoE训练。

Abstract: The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.

Result: 对角缩放使p95延迟最多降低40%，单查询成本最多降低37%，重平衡减少2至5倍。

Conclusion: 强调多维缩放模型的必要性，为云数据库下一代自动缩放奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.

### [45] [Exploiting Low Scanwidth to Resolve Soft Polytomies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20771)

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Phylogenetic networks allow modeling reticulate evolution, capturing events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the classical statement of the problem is not robust to poorly supported branches in biological data, possibly leading to false negatives. In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Malík, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(Δ_T \cdot k \cdot \log(k))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \operatorname{sw}(Γ) + Δ_N$, with $Δ_T$ and $Δ_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\operatorname{sw}(Γ)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size. Our approach leverages the fact that phylogenetic networks encountered in practice often exhibit low scanwidth, making the problem more tractable.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hankel matrices are an important class of highly-structured matrices, arising across computational mathematics, engineering, and theoretical computer science. It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and any $ε> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\|H-H_k\|_F \leq ε\|H\|_F$ for $k = O(\log n \log(1/ε))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\polylog(n, 1/ε)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\log n \log(1/ε))$ Hankel matrix $\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\|H - \widehat{H}\|_F \leq O(\|E\|_F) + ε\|H\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.

Conclusion: 没有比例规则能比MES方法获得更好的功利主义保证。

Abstract: In recent years, research in Participatory Budgeting (PB) has put a greater emphasis on rules satisfying notions of fairness and proportionality, with the Method of Equal Shares (MES) being a prominent example. However, proportionality can come at a cost to the total utilitarian welfare. Our work formalizes this relationship, by deriving minimum utilitarian welfare guarantees for MES for a subclass of satisfaction functions called DNS functions, which includes two of the most popular ways of measuring a voter's utility in the PB setting: considering (1) the total cost of approved projects or (2) the total number of those projects. Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal. We show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight for rules satisfying Extended Justified Representation up to one project, showing that no proportional rule can achieve a better utilitarian guarantee than MES.

Abstract: We consider discrete allocation problem where $m$ indivisible goods are to be divided among $n$ agents. When agents' valuations are additive, the well-known cycle cancelling lemma by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos plays a key role in design and analysis of rounding algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove an analogous lemma for the case of submodular valuations. Our algorithm removes cycles in the support graph of a fractional allocation while guaranteeing that each agent's value, measured using the multilinear extension, does not decrease.
  We demonstrate applications of the cycle-canceling algorithm, along with other ideas, to obtain new algorithms and results for three well-studied allocation objectives: max-min (Santa Claus problem), Nash social welfare (NSW), and maximin-share (MMS). For the submodular NSW problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{5}$-approximation; for the MMS problem, we obtain a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$-approximation through new simple algorithms. For various special cases where the goods are "small" valued or the number of agents is constant, we obtain tight/best-known approximation algorithms. All our results are in the value-oracle model.

Conclusion: 相对tâtonnement解决了任务市场中tâtonnement动态收敛问题，给出收敛速率，完成对竞争均衡局部稳定性的分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of tâtonnement dynamics in markets with chores. Tâtonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.
  Analyzing tâtonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the tâtonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that naïve tâtonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative tâtonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].
  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \in (1, \infty)$, we show that relative tâtonnement converges to an $\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability.

Result: 推导安全改进关系是co - NP完全问题；一般情况下推理规则不完备，但在自然且普遍适用的结果对应假设下规则完备。

Conclusion: 明确了推导安全改进关系的复杂度和推理规则的完备性情况。

Abstract: We consider a setting in which a principal gets to choose which game from some given set is played by a group of agents. The principal would like to choose a game that favors one of the players, the social preferences of the players, or the principal's own preferences. Unfortunately, given the potential multiplicity of equilibria, it is conceptually unclear how to tell which of even any two games is better. Oesterheld et al. (2022) propose that we use assumptions about outcome correspondence -- i.e., about how the outcomes of different games relate -- to allow comparisons in some cases. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.
  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete. However, we also show that under natural, generally applicable assumptions about outcome correspondence the rules are complete.

Result: 开发的算法显著优于基线，优化提示呈现稳定、与领域无关的模式。

Conclusion: 存在“普遍有效”的GEO策略，数据和代码公开。

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), generative engines are becoming powerful alternatives to traditional search, reshaping retrieval tasks. In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a "universally effective" GEO strategy. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO.

Result: 通过大量实验评估了数据集和工作流程的有效性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain extensive structured and unstructured data, including tabular information and free-text clinical notes. Querying relevant patient information often requires complex database operations, increasing the workload for clinicians. However, complex table relationships and professional terminology in EHRs limit the query accuracy. In this work, we construct a publicly available dataset, TQGen, that integrates both \textbf{T}ables and clinical \textbf{T}ext for natural language-to-query \textbf{Gen}eration. To address the challenges posed by complex medical terminology and diverse types of questions in EHRs, we propose TQGen-EHRQuery, a framework comprising a medical knowledge module and a questions template matching module. For processing medical text, we introduced the concept of a toolset, which encapsulates the text processing module as a callable tool, thereby improving processing efficiency and flexibility. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our dataset and workflow, demonstrating their potential to enhance information querying in EHR systems.

Method: 引入VisionRAG，采用三阶段金字塔索引框架创建向量，查询时用金字塔索引检索相关页面，再将原始页面图像编码给多模态大语言模型，检索时用互反排名融合产生稳健排名。

Result: VisionRAG每页仅存储17到27个向量，在金融文档基准测试中取得较好成绩，FinanceBench上准确率达0.8051，TAT DQA上召回率达0.9629。

Conclusion: 无OCR、摘要引导的多模态检索是传统文本提取管道的实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.

Method: 提出FITRep框架，含概念层次信息提取（CHIE）、保结构降维（SPDR）和基于FAISS的聚类（FBC）。

Result: 在美团广告系统在线A/B测试中，CTR提升3.60%，CPM提升4.25%。

Conclusion: FITRep框架有效且有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Online platforms usually suffer from user experience degradation due to near-duplicate items with similar visuals and text. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.

Conclusion: RIA框架能有效提升推荐质量，在效率和效果上取得平衡。

Abstract: Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Motivation: 持续 EEG 解码任务中，个体 EEG 信号差异大，现有方法依赖存储历史数据，存在隐私和内存问题。

Method: 提出 Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL) 框架，构建类级原型，通过跨主体特征对齐和知识蒸馏增量对齐新特征空间与全局原型记忆。

Result: 在 BCI Competition IV 2a 和 2b 数据集上验证，能有效平衡知识保留和适应性。

Conclusion: ProNECL 框架在跨主体持续 EEG 解码任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 超越绝热近似，深入研究MHN与自注意力的关系，探索Hopfield网络对改进Transformer架构的作用。

Method: 通过添加MHN的隐藏状态这一新变量到自注意力中，建立Hopfield网络与Transformer更广义的对应关系。

Result: 新的注意力机制MHA能继承注意力分数，改善注意力权重性质，理论和实证表明可改善深度Transformer的秩崩溃和令牌均匀性问题，且不增加训练参数情况下提升准确率。

Conclusion: Hopfield网络为改进Transformer架构提供了有用视角。

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

Motivation: 含噪标签训练深度网络会因过拟合导致泛化能力差和准确率下降，现有方法常依赖干净数据子集。

Method: 使用自监督学习（如SimCLR和Barlow Twins）预训练特征提取器骨干，再在含噪数据集上进行标准监督训练。

Result: 在不同噪声率下，自监督预训练持续提高分类准确率和下游标签错误检测性能，噪声率越高，性能差距越大；低噪声水平下与ImageNet预训练模型效果相当，高噪声下大幅超越。

Conclusion: 该方法无需干净标签子集，能训练出更抗噪的模型，在高噪声下表现出色。

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Conclusion: 进化样本权重在优化公平性和预测性能方面有优势，但优化目标的选择很关键。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Result: 在一系列线性和非线性逆问题中，RePS比现有基于扩散的基线方法收敛更快，重建质量更优。

Conclusion: RePS是解决线性和非线性逆问题的通用且高效的框架。

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Conclusion: 主动切片发现方法是有效的，且基于不确定性的主动学习算法在发现人类定义切片方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation. This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM). The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods. These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 该问题存在丰富的算法选择、理论细微差别和开放性问题。

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动方法适用于飞行测试安全监控，且组件具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Motivation: 大语言模型推理存在高解码延迟和跨异构边缘云环境可扩展性受限问题，现有推测解码技术限于单节点执行。

Method: 提出DSD框架扩展SD到多设备部署，引入DSD - Sim模拟器，设计AWC策略动态调整推测窗口大小。

Result: 在不同工作负载实验中，DSD比现有SD基线实现了高达1.1倍的加速和9.7%的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: DSD能实现边缘和云端大语言模型的敏捷和可扩展服务。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.

Motivation: 研究未训练大型神经网络的初始猜测偏差对早期训练动态的影响，以及损失函数选择在其中的作用。

Method: 分析未训练网络的偏差现象，研究不同损失函数（Blurry和Piecewise - zero loss）在初始偏差下的表现。

Result: 损失函数的选择对网络早期训练有显著影响，Blurry和Piecewise - zero loss在初始偏差下可能无法引导训练方向。

Conclusion: 需要仔细考虑初始猜测偏差与训练方案各组件的相互作用。

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Result: Cliff方法在所有解纠缠基准测试中优于基线。

Conclusion: Cliff方法在无监督解纠缠中有效。

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Result: 相比单步方法，模型在远距离区域精度更高；与数值HUX替代模型相比，性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 为高保真太阳风建模建立了新方法，提供了灵活、可训练且数据驱动的替代方案。

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种区别于标准随机投影的特征映射方法，以获得更优性能。

Result: 在经验评估中，框架比归一化高斯基线有更好的正交性保留和分布紧密度。

Conclusion: Primal框架是随机矩阵投影在计算上高效、数学上严谨的替代方案。

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Result: 为两类模型得到多项式时间算法和在多种情况下的最优或接近最优的样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 实现了对两类Ising模型估计的统一分析，给出有效算法和复杂度保证。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Result: RLVR能在五个对抗性安全基准上同时增强推理能力并维持或改善安全防护。

Conclusion: 特定训练方法（RLVR）可同时实现提升推理能力和安全防护的目标，为大语言模型的安全部署提供见解。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的完整性框架为动态图表征质量提供了与任务无关且可解释的评估工具，为模型选择和架构设计提供更明确指导。

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GNet2025/GNet.

Result: 提出的框架和算法可实现基于大语言模型的实用且统计合理的评估，并减少准确率估计的不确定性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效解决大语言模型评估中的偏差和不确定性问题，实现更可靠的评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

Method: 研究Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream（用CatBoost）和Semantic Stream（用DistilBERT）两种检测范式，对DistilBERT在对抗性中毒数据集评估，以Tesla T4 GPU为基准测试。

Result: DistilBERT检测效果优（AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981），实时延迟可接受（7.403毫秒）；CatBoost延迟低8.4倍（0.885毫秒），计算资源消耗少。

Conclusion: 有GPU设施选DistilBERT，边缘部署或成本敏感环境选CatBoost，成本敏感学习优化后投资回报率超99.96%。

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Conclusion: SGA - ACR框架能有效解决大语言模型在强化学习中规划与执行的对齐问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Result: 在多种基础VLM模型的多模态任务中，FANoise能持续提升整体性能。

Conclusion: FANoise能有效减轻噪声负面影响并保留其益处，是提升多模态表征学习性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.

Conclusion: 交错重置技术能有效减少同步滚动带来的非平稳性，提升强化学习训练效果。

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Motivation: 线性状态空间模型（SSMs）在回忆导向任务中性能不佳，需缩小与软注意力的差距。

Method: 在测试时解决在线岭回归问题，采用自适应正则化策略和Chebyshev迭代，开发硬件感知分块实现和自定义内核。

Result: GKA在短上下文任务中优于现有SSM层，在长上下文任务中比其他基线有超10%的相对提升。

Conclusion: GKA能在保持SSM效率的同时，通过考虑完整历史信息提升性能。

Abstract: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.

Result: 实现了更好的时间泛化，用户GMV提升2.33%，并在Shopee产品搜索中成功部署。

Conclusion: ELBO$_	ext{TDS}$框架有效解决了推荐系统的时间分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Conclusion: FedAPA算法在Wi-Fi CSI传感的人群计数任务中有效，能提升性能并减少通信开销。

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Result: 在D4RL实验中，TDP较以往方法决策频率提高11 - 24.8倍，性能相当或更高。

Conclusion: TDP能有效提高决策效率，减少计算开销，且在性能上表现良好。

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Result: BFT显著优于SFT，在医学任务中能让模型学到SFT遗漏的知识，在生物任务中超越GeneAgent，其文本嵌入可用于下游任务。

Conclusion: BFT有助于大语言模型在生物医学研究中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

Conclusion: Deceptron和D - IPG等方法能有效解决物理科学逆问题，减少迭代次数，提高收敛速度。

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

Conclusion: 该方法可对现有检查点事后操作，无需梯度、校准集或路由器训练，是一种高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

TL;DR: 提出Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR)范式，用Mixture of Attention (MoA)模块提升效果，还有优化技术，实验显示有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Early Stage Ranking (ESR)系统采用“用户 - 项目解耦”方法，效果有限，难以捕捉细粒度用户 - 项目亲和力和交叉信号。

Method: 提出GESR范式，引入MoA模块，包含Hard Matching Attention (HMA)、Target - Aware Self Attention和Cross Attention模块；用Multi - Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG)模块精炼编码；采用一系列优化技术，如定制内核和缓存机制。

Result: 通过离线和在线实验验证，GESR范式在关键指标、参与度和消费任务上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这是首次在大规模ESR阶段成功部署全目标感知注意力序列建模。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DLM解码策略依赖高置信度标记存在信息论瓶颈，限制解码进度和生成速度。

Method: 理论证明优先高置信度标记的低效性，提出ETE策略结合跨块解码和高不确定性标记探索。

Result: 实验验证理论边界，ETE相比仅依赖置信度的基线方法减少解码轮数且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: ETE策略能有效提高DLM的解码效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Motivation: 大语言模型在程序验证尤其是Lean4交互式证明框架中存在困难，现有方法难以涵盖代码、规范和证明三个领域，需解决可扩展性问题。

Method: 将验证分解为代码、规范和证明三个相互关联的领域，引出功能性、规范驱动和面向证明的推理行为作为中间表示来连接这些领域。

Conclusion: 结构化领域对齐是推进验证合成的有前景方向，BRIDGE为通过专家迭代或RLVR训练奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

This enables us to build simpler and more effective models, as well as to combine different biological feature sets. Experiments on Dietary Restriction datasets show significant improvements over existing methods, proving that feature selection can be critical for reliable gene prioritization.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

Conclusion: DPC指标实现了对局部特征归因方法保真度的快速、确定性和可信赖的评估，能与PC一起进行全面高效评估。

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文指出控制logits变化对Transformer模型训练稳定性重要，提出为查询和键权重分配依赖参数的学习率的方法，能提升网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型训练中查询和键权重易增大影响稳定性，QK norm方法存在适用局限。

Method: 为查询和键权重分配依赖参数的学习率来控制logits的变化。

Result: 该方法可提高网络基础学习率，在MLA设置中优于其他方法，在多头注意力机制中性能与QK norm相当。

Conclusion: 控制logits变化对模型稳定性重要，所提方法有效可行。

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Conclusion: AAR提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，增强了对污染数据集的鲁棒性，利于在安全和医疗等领域应用。

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Motivation: 标准Transformer架构中刚性、统一的计算分配限制了效率和可扩展性，尤其是对于大规模模型和长序列。

Method: 引入SDT和STT架构，SDT通过交替的决策层和动态层进行计算路由，STT将条件计算扩展到时间域。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构为效率提供了灵活框架，为更高效的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

TL;DR: 本文提出浅通用多项式网络（SUPNs），它用单层多项式替代部分隐藏层，以更少参数实现足够表达能力，理论证明其收敛速率，数值实验显示其在近似误差和变异性上优于DNNs和KANs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs和KANs需大量可训练参数，导致网络不透明且易产生局部极小值，网络初始化对模型样本外准确性影响大，因此提出SUPNs。

Method: 用单层带可学习系数的多项式替代除最后隐藏层外的所有隐藏层，结合DNNs和多项式优势；进行理论证明和大量数值实验。

Result: 证明SUPNs收敛速率与同阶最佳多项式近似相同，推导出准最优SUPN参数的显式公式；数值实验中，给定可训练参数数量下，SUPNs的近似误差和变异性比DNNs和KANs低一个数量级，在非光滑函数上优于多项式投影。

Conclusion: SUPNs能以更少参数实现足够表达能力，在近似性能上优于DNNs、KANs和多项式投影。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: CBO方法在神经网络训练中有一定优势，混合方法和改进后的CBO有更好的性能。

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Method: 提出基于元学习的双层优化框架ShiftSyncNet，包含转换网络TransNet和时移校正网络SyncNet，SyncNet学习训练对间的时间偏移并应用傅里叶相移来对齐监督信号。

Result: 在一个真实工业数据集和两个公共数据集上，ShiftSyncNet分别比强基线模型高出9.4%、6.0%和12.8%。

Conclusion: ShiftSyncNet能有效校正时间偏移、提高标签质量和转换精度，为解决多模态生理转换中的时间不一致性指明统一方向。

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

Method: 提出IntAttention，核心是IndexSoftmax算子，集成稀疏感知裁剪、32项查找表近似和直接整数归一化，消除数据类型转换开销。

Result: 相比FP16基线实现高达3.7倍加速和61%的能量降低，在Armv8 CPU上比传统INT8注意力管道快2.0倍。

Conclusion: IntAttention能在多种语言和视觉模型上保持高保真度，实现商品边缘设备上实用高效的Transformer推理。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Conclusion: 提出的方法对非线性分类器的评估和训练有用。

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

Conclusion: 提出的MD - GAK和PMD - GAK方法有效，在不确定性估计和性能上表现出色。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Latent reasoning represents a new development in Transformer language models that has shown potential in compressing reasoning lengths compared to chain-of-thought reasoning. By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models. Experiments on the Llama 3.2 1B model and the GSM8K-Aug dataset show a $52\%$ drop in total reasoning length with no penalty to accuracy. In future work, we plan to extend to additional models and datasets, analyze relationships between training coefficients, experiment with architecture variations, and continue our knowledge distillation for latent reasoning SFT efforts. We make our code and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/apning/adaptive-latent-reasoning.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.

Conclusion: 通过所提方法能支持对Transformer内部的系统分析，推动可复现的可解释性研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art results across many natural language tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain difficult to interpret. In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research. We make our code available at https://github.com/Vainateya/Feature_Geometry_Visualization.

Motivation: 前人研究发现浅层多层感知器在合成三维任务训练中自发形成KAG结构，不清楚该现象在现实高维场景是否持续及几何空间特性。

Method: 将KAG分析扩展到MNIST数字分类任务，用2层MLP并在多尺度进行系统空间分析。

Result: 训练中出现KAG，且在从局部7像素邻域到完整28x28图像的各空间尺度上一致出现，不同训练过程有相同定性模式。

Conclusion: 神经网络在现实高维数据学习中会自发形成有组织、尺度不变的几何结构。

Abstract: Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.
  We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit classification (784 dimensions) using 2-layer MLPs with systematic spatial analysis at multiple scales. We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data.

Motivation: 解决深度Vision Transformers性能不如浅层这一挑战常见缩放假设的问题。

Method: 对ViT - S、ViT - B和ViT - L在ImageNet上进行系统实证分析，用信息混洗指数量化信息混合模式。

Result: 发现Cliff - Plateau - Climb模式；更好性能与[CLS]标记边缘化有关；ViT - L信息 - 任务权衡比ViT - B晚约10层，额外层与信息扩散而非任务性能提升相关。

Conclusion: 该体制下的Transformer架构从精心校准深度中获益更多，信息混洗指数可用于诊断现有模型和指导未来架构设计。

Abstract: Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

TL;DR: 提出将多轮强化学习问题转化为单轮问题的方法Iterative PPO，结合单轮RLHF工具，兼具在线更新适应性和离线训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大语言模型在多轮对话结果上存在挑战，源于稀疏长时奖励及响应级规划与token级生成的差异。

Method: 将多轮RL问题正式简化为单轮RLHF风格问题，以学习到的多轮Q函数作为单轮问题奖励模型，提出Iterative PPO算法交替拟合Q函数和改进策略。

Result: 证明解决单轮RL问题与多轮问题中的策略改进步骤等价。

Conclusion: Iterative PPO方法实用，可利用现成单轮RLHF工具，在在线和离线方法间取得平衡。

Abstract: Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training.

Motivation: 创建编程环境中奖励破解的基准，以研究和检测模型的奖励破解行为。

Method: 从LiveCodeBench获取问题并创建易奖励破解环境，用保留单元测试、LLM评判和测试文件编辑检测三种方式测量奖励破解，并相互验证。测试多个模型和三种流行的专有编码代理。

Result: LLM评判在明确案例中检测奖励破解非常有效，保留测试用例提升效果极小；Codex和Claude Code有明确奖励破解行为，三个代理都有行为失调问题。

Conclusion: EvilGenie可用于检测编程环境中的奖励破解行为，不同模型在奖励破解方面存在问题。

Abstract: We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实推理密集型任务缺乏验证器，专家示范未得到充分利用，需要一种仅从专家示范学习推理能力的方法。

Method: 引入RARO，通过逆强化学习，设置策略（生成器）和相对批评者（判别器）的对抗交互，联合并持续训练二者。

Result: RARO在Countdown、DeepMath和Poetry Writing任务上显著优于无验证器的基线方法，且与可验证任务上的强化学习有相同的稳健扩展趋势。

Conclusion: RARO仅通过专家示范就能有效激发强大的推理性能，即使在缺乏特定任务验证器时也能实现稳健的推理学习。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI models that are accurate, efficient, and sustainable.The paper questions the assumptions of equal importance by focusing on applying and analyzing the roles of individual samples in telecom training and assessing whether the proposed model optimizes computation and energy use. we perform sample-level gradient analysis across epochs to identify patterns of influence and redundancy in model learning. Based on this, we propose a sample importance framework thats electively prioritizes impactful data and reduces computation without compromising accuracy. Experiments on three real-world telecom datasets show that our method [reserves performance while reducing data needs and computational overhead while advancing the goals of sustainable AI in telecommunications.

Result: 规模依赖的效率改进可解释大部分效率差距，LSTM到Transformer的转变占多数增益，共解释6930倍效率提升。

Conclusion: 小模型算法进展比之前假设慢，算法效率衡量有强参考依赖性。

Abstract: Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent.

Abstract: Despite remarkable technological advances, AI systems may still benefit from biological principles, such as recurrent connectivity and energy-efficient mechanisms. Drawing inspiration from the brain, we present a biologically plausible extension of the eligibility propagation (e-prop) learning rule for recurrent spiking networks. By translating the time-driven update scheme into an event-driven one, we integrate the learning rule into a simulation platform for large-scale spiking neural networks and demonstrate its applicability to tasks such as neuromorphic MNIST. We extend the model with prominent biological features such as continuous dynamics and weight updates, strict locality, and sparse connectivity. Our results show that biologically grounded constraints can inform the design of computationally efficient AI algorithms, offering scalability to millions of neurons without compromising learning performance. This work bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience, paving the way for sustainable, biologically inspired AI systems while advancing our understanding of brain-like learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents are increasingly used to generate software across a wide range of domains. Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.

Abstract: The increasing availability of data and advancements in computational intelligence have accelerated the adoption of data-driven methods (DDMs) in product development. However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities.

Using a Design Science Research approach, we (i) derive challenges from PfPC/NATO documentation and recent practice, (ii) define solution objectives, and (iii) conduct a systematic mapping from challenges to proven patterns. We identify seven technical challenges: interoperability, resilience, multilingual support, data security and privacy, scalability, platform independence, and modularity. We illustrate the patterns with a national use case from the German armed forces.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to describe an adaptive decision-making support model aimed at improving the efficiency of engineering infrastructure reconstruction program management in the context of developing the architecture and work breakdown structure of programs. As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems.

TL;DR: 研究评估大语言模型对软件设计概念的理解，发现其在理想条件有一定理解，但在实际嘈杂环境中自主推理能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在软件工程领域应用增多，但对核心软件设计概念理解的健壮性不明，需系统评估。

Method: 通过编程生成设计不佳的代码片段，测试DeepSeek - R1模型家族在不同指导水平和上下文噪声下对内聚和耦合概念的理解。

Result: 模型在理想条件下对概念有一定理解，但实际知识脆弱且不对称，耦合推理在嘈杂开放场景表现差，内聚分析在有指导任务中较健壮但无指导时也失败。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能辅助识别设计缺陷，但在嘈杂现实环境中自主推理能力有限，需提升程序理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly adopted in the software engineering domain, yet the robustness of their grasp on core software design concepts remains unclear. We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \textit{Verification} to \textit{Guided} and \textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.

Abstract: This empirical investigation elucidates the limitations of deterministic, unidimensional productivity heuristics by operationalizing the SPACE framework through extensive repository mining. Utilizing a dataset derived from open-source repositories, the study employs rigorous statistical methodologies including Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and RoBERTa-based sentiment classification to synthesize a holistic, multi-faceted productivity metric. Analytical results reveal a statistically significant positive correlation between negative affective states and commit frequency, implying a cycle of iterative remediation driven by frustration. Furthermore, the investigation has demonstrated that analyzing the topology of contributor interactions yields superior fidelity in mapping collaborative dynamics compared to traditional volume-based metrics. Ultimately, this research posits a Composite Productivity Score (CPS) to address the heterogeneity of developer efficacy.

Motivation: 大语言模型生成代码时常用到过时API，重新训练成本高，现有轻量级模型编辑方法能否更新API知识尚不明确。

Method: 应用10种模型编辑技术更新三个大语言模型的过时API知识，引入EDAPIBench基准；提出AdaLoRA - L方法，区分通用和特定API层进行编辑。

Result: AdaLoRA在生成最新API上表现最佳，但特异性不足；AdaLoRA - L显著提高特异性，其他指标表现相当。

Conclusion: AdaLoRA - L可有效更新大语言模型中的过时API知识，同时提高特异性。

Abstract: Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines "Common API Layers" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to "Specific API Layers" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.

Abstract: While mobile app evolution has been widely studied, geographical variation in app behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.
  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.
  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps. We also release a dataset of 81,963 GeoTwins to support future work. Our findings reveal systemic regional disparities in mobile software, with implications for researchers, developers, platform architects, and policymakers.

Conclusion: 提炼出以人为中心的AI在IDE中的设计原则，平衡干扰与支持等。

Abstract: AI-assisted tools support developers in performing cognitively demanding tasks such as bug detection and code readability assessment. Despite the advancements in the technical characteristics of these tools, little is known about how developers mentally model them and how mismatches affect trust, control, and adoption. We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance. Trust, in both tasks, depends on the clarity of explanations, timing, and user control. A set of design principles for Human-Centered AI in IDEs has been distilled, aiming to balance disruption with support, conciseness with depth, and automation with human agency.

Abstract: Automating the adaptation of software engineering (SE) research artifacts across datasets is essential for scalability and reproducibility, yet it remains largely unstudied. Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.

Conclusion: 该领域存在测试故障检测能力弱和缺乏标准化评估基准的挑战，未来研究应向自主测试代理和混合系统发展。

Abstract: Unit testing is an essential yet laborious technique for verifying software and mitigating regression risks. Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools. This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on converting the potential of LLMs into industrial-grade testing solutions.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在加密货币市场自适应和数据驱动的投资组合管理中有潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning--based framework for cryptocurrency portfolio management using the Soft Actor--Critic (SAC) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. Traditional portfolio optimization methods often struggle to adapt to the highly volatile and nonlinear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. To address this, we design an agent that learns continuous trading actions directly from historical market data through interaction with a simulated trading environment. The agent optimizes portfolio weights to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing downside risk and transaction costs. Experimental evaluations on multiple cryptocurrencies demonstrate that the SAC and DDPG agents outperform baseline strategies such as equal-weighted and mean--variance portfolios. The SAC algorithm, with its entropy-regularized objective, shows greater stability and robustness in noisy market conditions compared to DDPG. These results highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning for adaptive and data-driven portfolio management in cryptocurrency markets.

Conclusion: 本工作通过整合边界约束推进机器学习在量化金融中的应用，为不完全市场定价和对冲提供实用工具。

Abstract: In incomplete financial markets, pricing and hedging European options lack a unique no-arbitrage solution due to unhedgeable risks. This paper introduces a constrained deep learning approach to determine option prices and hedging strategies that minimize the Profit and Loss (P&L) distribution around zero. We employ a single neural network to represent the option price function, with its gradient serving as the hedging strategy, optimized via a loss function enforcing the self-financing portfolio condition. A key challenge arises from the non-smooth nature of option payoffs (e.g., vanilla calls are non-differentiable at-the-money, while digital options are discontinuous), which conflicts with the inherent smoothness of standard neural networks. To address this, we compare unconstrained networks against constrained architectures that explicitly embed the terminal payoff condition, drawing inspiration from PDE-solving techniques. Our framework assumes two tradable assets: the underlying and a liquid call option capturing volatility dynamics. Numerical experiments evaluate the method on simple options with varying non-smoothness, the exotic Equinox option, and scenarios with market jumps for robustness. Results demonstrate superior P&L distributions, highlighting the efficacy of constrained networks in handling realistic payoffs. This work advances machine learning applications in quantitative finance by integrating boundary constraints, offering a practical tool for pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.

Motivation: 经典相关矩阵无法表示金融市场高阶、非线性和状态依赖的相互作用，需新方法。

Method: 引入QNA框架，定义纠缠风险指数（ERI）和量子预警信号（QEWS）两个结构测度。

Result: 量子熵比经典熵演化更平滑、制度区分更清晰；ERI在结构收紧时上升；QEWS能显示结构张力变化。

Conclusion: QNA可对市场脆弱性、制度转变和潜在信息流进行结构诊断，为系统风险研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Classical correlation matrices capture only linear and pairwise co-movements, leaving higher-order, nonlinear, and state-dependent interactions of financial markets unrepresented. This paper introduces the Quantum Network of Assets (QNA), a density-matrix based framework that embeds cross-asset dependencies into a quantum-information representation. The approach does not assume physical quantum effects but uses the mathematical structure of density operators, entropy, and mutual information to describe market organisation at a structural level.
  Within this framework we define two structural measures: the Entanglement Risk Index (ERI), which summarises global non-separability and the compression of effective market degrees of freedom, and the Quantum Early-Warning Signal (QEWS), which tracks changes in entropy to detect latent information build-up. These measures reveal dependency geometry that classical covariance-based tools cannot capture.
  Using NASDAQ-100 data from 2024-2025, we show that quantum entropy displays smoother evolution and clearer regime distinctions than classical entropy, and that ERI rises during periods of structural tightening even when volatility remains low. Around the 2025 US tariff announcement, QEWS shows a marked pre-event increase in structural tension followed by a sharp collapse after the announcement, indicating that structural transitions can precede price movements without implying predictive modelling.
  QNA therefore provides a structural diagnostic of market fragility, regime shifts, and latent information flow. The framework suggests new directions for systemic risk research by linking empirical asset networks with tools from quantum information theory.

Result: 通过基于真实数据的实证应用，证明了该方法的可行性、稳健性和实际相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力用于监管和管理应用。

Abstract: Despite decades of research in risk management, most of the literature has focused on scalar risk measures (like e.g. Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall). While such scalar measures provide compact and tractable summaries, they provide a poor informative value as they miss the intrinsic multivariate nature of risk.To contribute to a paradigmatic enhancement, and building on recent theoretical work by Faugeras and Pagés (2024), we propose a novel multivariate representation of risk that better reflects the structure of potential portfolio losses, while maintaining desirable properties of interpretability and analytical coherence. The proposed framework extends the classical frequency-severity approach and provides a more comprehensive characterization of extreme events. Several empirical applications based on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility, robustness and practical relevance of the methodology, suggesting its potential for both regulatory and managerial applications.

Abstract: Feature selection has remained a daunting challenge in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where increasingly complex, high-dimensional datasets demand principled strategies for isolating the most informative predictors. Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.

Method: 发现特定条件下函数集的凸性，定义HTMC范数和ResNet范数，并建立两者的三明治界关系。

Conclusion: DNNs实现计算奥卡姆剃刀原理，这能解释其成功，ResNets在HTMC体制中有优势。

Abstract: This paper argues that DNNs implement a computational Occam's razor -- finding the `simplest' algorithm that fits the data -- and that this could explain their incredible and wide-ranging success over more traditional statistical methods. We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $ε$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $cε^{-γ}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $γ>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.

Conclusion: 该工作连接信息几何和统计学习，有理论保证，适用于需严格验证的应用，几何校准贡献在理论基础而非优于简单替代方法。

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence systems make critical decisions yet often fail silently when uncertain. We develop a geometric framework for post-hoc calibration of neural network probability outputs, treating probability vectors as points on the $(c-1)$-dimensional probability simplex equipped with the Fisher--Rao metric. Our approach yields Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) calibration maps that reduce exactly to Platt scaling for binary problems (Proposition~1) while extending naturally to multi-class settings -- providing a principled generalization that existing methods lack. Complementing calibration, we define geometric reliability scores based on Fisher--Rao distance and construct neutral zones for principled deferral of uncertain predictions.
  Theoretical contributions include: (i) consistency of the calibration estimator at rate $O_p(n^{-1/2})$ via M-estimation theory (Theorem~1), and (ii) tight concentration bounds for reliability scores with explicit sub-Gaussian parameters enabling sample size calculations for validation set design (Theorem~2). We conjecture Neyman--Pearson optimality of our neutral zone construction based on connections to Bhattacharyya coefficients. Empirical validation on Adeno-Associated Virus classification demonstrates that the two-stage framework (calibration followed by reliability-based deferral) captures 72.5\% of errors while deferring 34.5\% of samples. Notably, this operational gain is achievable with any well-calibrated probability output; the contribution of geometric calibration lies in its theoretical foundations rather than empirical superiority over simpler alternatives. This work bridges information geometry and statistical learning, offering formal guarantees relevant to applications requiring rigorous validation.

We parameterize the nonparametric term using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and formulate a penalized LAD problem for estimation. Specifically, our model exhibits the following challenges. First, the regularization term can be nonconvex and nonsmooth, necessitating the introduction of infinite dimensional variational analysis and nonsmooth analysis into the asymptotic normality discussion. Second, our network must expand (in width, sparsity level and depth) as more samples are observed, thereby introducing additional difficulties for theoretical analysis. Third, the oracle of the proposed estimator is itself defined through a ultra high-dimensional, nonconvex, and discontinuous optimization problem, which already entails substantial computational and theoretical challenges. Under such the challenges, we establish the consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Furthermore, we analyze the oracle problem itself and its continuous relaxation. We study the convergence of a proximal subgradient method for both formulations, highlighting their structural differences lead to distinct computational subproblems along the iterations. In particular, the relaxed formulation admits significantly cheaper proximal updates, reflecting an inherent trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational tractability.

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a cornerstone of modern Bayesian learning, enabling approximate inference in complex models that would otherwise be intractable. However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.

Abstract: A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.
  When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.
  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能在一定条件下估计网络系统因果效应，但强时间趋势或内生干扰会破坏识别。

Abstract: Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.

Abstract: SVEMnet is an R package for fitting Self-Validated Ensemble Models (SVEM) with elastic-net base learners and for performing multi-response optimization in small-sample mixture--process design-of-experiments (DOE) studies with numeric, categorical, and mixture factors. SVEMnet wraps elastic-net and relaxed elastic-net models for Gaussian and binomial responses from glmnet in a fractional random-weight (FRW) resampling scheme with anti-correlated train/validation weights; penalties are selected by validation-weighted AIC- and BIC-type criteria, and predictions are averaged across replicates to stabilize fits near the interpolation boundary. In addition to the core SVEM engine, the package provides deterministic high-order formula expansion, a permutation-based whole-model test heuristic, and a mixture-constrained random-search optimizer that combines Derringer--Suich desirability functions, bootstrap-based uncertainty summaries, and optional mean-level specification-limit probabilities to generate scored candidate tables and diverse exploitation and exploration medoids for sequential fit--score--run--refit workflows. A simulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation study illustrates these tools in a small-sample mixture--process DOE setting, and simulation experiments based on sparse quadratic response surfaces benchmark SVEMnet against repeated cross-validated elastic-net baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可用于解决相关问题，通过应用得到了验证。

Abstract: The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a popular technique for performing inference in state-space models (SSMs), particularly when the dynamic process is high-dimensional. Unlike reweighting methods such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, i.e. particle filters), the EnKF leverages either the linear Gaussian structure of the SSM or an approximation thereof, to maintain diversity of the sampled latent states (the so-called ensemble members) via shifting-based updates. Joint parameter and state inference using an EnKF is typically achieved by augmenting the state vector with the static parameter. In this case, it is assumed that both parameters and states follow a linear Gaussian state-space model, which may be unreasonable in practice. In this paper, we combine the reweighting and shifting methods by replacing the particle filter used in the SMC^2 algorithm of Chopin et al., with the ensemble Kalman filter. Hence, parameter particles are weighted according to the estimated observed-data likelihood from the latest observation computed by the EnKF, and particle diversity is maintained via a resample-move step that targets the marginal parameter posterior under the EnKF. Extensions to the resulting algorithm are proposed, such as the use of a delayed acceptance kernel in the rejuvenation step and incorporation of nonlinear observation models. We illustrate the resulting methodology via several applications.

Result: 明确两种病理的具体情况，梳理了一系列算法补救方案。

Conclusion: 指出了未来研究的有前景的方向。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible approach to approximate sampling from intractable probability distributions, with a rich theoretical foundation and comprising a wealth of exemplar algorithms. While the qualitative correctness of MCMC algorithms is often easy to ensure, their practical efficiency is contingent on the `target' distribution being reasonably well-behaved.
  In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies.
  We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space. In each case, we formulate the pathology in concrete terms, review a range of proposed algorithmic remedies to the pathology, and outline promising directions for future research.

Result: GAT校正器在所有40个实验中提升性能，零样本设置下执行准确率和交互准确率平均提升1.9%，上下文学习设置下执行准确率平均提升1.72%、交互准确率平均提升0.92%。

Conclusion: GAT校正器在阿拉伯语的跨领域、上下文相关文本到SQL任务中优于之前的GAT验证技术。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成式推荐器的令牌表示提供新机制，实现更强准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于令牌的推荐模型平衡记忆和泛化提供新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

Motivation: 大语言模型在法律等专业领域表现不佳，缺乏特定领域预训练，且法律文档复杂难处理，需要提升其在法律任务上的性能。

Method: 在零样本设置下，对三个印度法律判决预测数据集进行三项实验：基于修辞角色重组文档、定义修辞角色让模型熟悉法律术语、模拟法院对修辞角色的逐步推理。

Result: 组织数据或解释关键法律术语显著提升模型性能，F1分数相比基线最少提高约1.5%，最多提高4.36%。

Conclusion: 在法律任务中，对数据进行组织和解释关键法律术语可有效提升大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架为审计大语言模型的数据泄漏提供了强大且实用的工具。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

Result: 在多个数据集和不同词汇表大小下，比BPE减少token数；训练GPT - 2模型减少步数、降低推理延迟、提高吞吐量；在下游任务表现提升；词汇覆盖高、未登录词率低；减少推理时内存。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度是一种有效方法，能在不牺牲下游性能的情况下提高语言模型效率。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Motivation: 现有评估多关注静态对话设置，忽略动态积累和复用经验能力，现实中LLM处理连续任务流时无法从积累交互中学习，需测试时进化。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未明确提及具体结论。

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Motivation: 寻找一种无需训练、词汇表或随机参数的文本嵌入生成方法，替代数据驱动的嵌入方法。

Method: 将每个标记解析为基于其Unicode整数表示的谐波轨迹，建立离散符号与连续向量空间的双射和可解释映射。

Result: 在Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS - B)及其多语言扩展实验中，HTP在英语中Spearman相关性为0.68，在十种语言中性能稳定，计算成本低，每句对延迟亚毫秒。

Conclusion: 有意义的语义关系可从确定性几何中产生，HTP为数据驱动的嵌入提供了透明高效的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

Motivation: 探究上下文学习（ICL）能否覆盖预训练标签语义，还是仅完善现有语义骨干。

Method: 将大语言模型视为提示诱导分类器，对比自然演示（正确标签）和倒置演示（翻转标签含义）下的行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐指标并引入语义覆盖率。

Result: 在八个分类任务和八个开源大语言模型上，发现支持语义锚定观点的证据，自然演示时ICL提高准确率且保持强先验对齐，倒置演示时模型无法学习连贯反语义分类器，语义覆盖率为零。

Conclusion: ICL主要调整输入到预训练稳定语义方向的投影，明确少样本提示的基本限制，在当前规模下覆盖标签语义需ICL之外的干预。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Motivation: 当前预训练和大语言模型在讽刺检测中因文本复杂、语言文化差异及缺乏背景信息面临挑战。

Method: 基于PMP方法，引入检索感知方法，通过网络检索添加非参数知识和激发模型内部知识两种方式提供上下文。

Result: 非参数检索在Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上使macro - F1提升9.87%，自我知识检索在Semeval和MUStARD数据集上分别提升3.29%和4.08%。

Conclusion: 上下文对提升大语言模型讽刺检测性能很重要，未来将优化相关上下文信息检索并研究检索质量对性能的影响。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

Motivation: 低资源语言分类常微调最终层，MLPs有固定非线性限制和高计算成本，需更好替代方案。

Method: 以KANs（FourierKAN、EfficientKAN、FasterKAN）为分类头，结合TF - IDF、fastText和多语言transformers等不同嵌入进行评估。

Result: KANs有竞争力或优于MLPs，EfficientKAN结合fastText F1最高，FasterKAN速度与准确性平衡最佳，EfficientKAN在transformer嵌入上与MLPs相当或稍优。

Conclusion: KANs是低资源语言分类中MLPs的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明SGASA显著提高了模型安全性。

Conclusion: SGASA具有自适应和可扩展的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用领域表现出色，但应用于抵押金融等专业领域需增强特定领域知识并保持指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效，MortgageLLM在抵押金融专业领域表现良好，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

Motivation: 探究能否直接训练语言模型的内省能力，而非等待其自发出现，解决Lindsey提出的‘训练内省是否有助于消除跨模型差异’问题。

Method: 对7B参数模型进行基于瞬态单令牌注入的微调。

Result: 模型从检测失败（准确率0.4%，误报率6.7%）转变为可靠检测（保留概念准确率85%，误报率0%），满足Lindsey三项标准，对未见概念向量有一定泛化能力。

Conclusion: 至少一个内省行为组件可直接诱导，为AI内置透明化提供了途径。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

Result: Odin在多基准测试中达SOTA，Light Odin性能有竞争力且计算成本低。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin构成无跳框架实现结构与文本集成。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

Conclusion: 揭示了语音翻译模型分配性别机制，发现高准确率模型的新机制。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Motivation: 现有多智能体合成框架存在可扩展性瓶颈和灵活性受限问题，需新框架。

Method: 提出Matrix框架，以分布式队列传递消息消除中央协调器，轻量级智能体独立执行任务，分布式服务处理密集计算。

Result: 在多种合成场景评估中，Matrix在相同硬件资源下实现2 - 15倍更高的数据生成吞吐量，且不影响输出质量。

Conclusion: Matrix框架可扩展到数万个并发智能体工作流，具有模块化、可配置设计，能适应多种数据生成工作流。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

Result: Orchestrator在HLE等测试中比GPT - 5准确率更高、成本更低，在多指标下性能和成本平衡最佳，能稳健泛化到未见工具。

Conclusion: 轻量级编排模型组合多样工具比现有方法更高效有效，为实用可扩展的工具增强推理系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有研究在训练使用简单或困难数据的效果，以及这些增益体现在简单或困难测试数据上的结论不一，需探究大语言模型在不同任务难度上的泛化能力。

Method: 对大语言模型在模型、数据集和细粒度难度组上进行系统评估，用数千个不同大语言模型的输出和项目反应理论对六个数据集的示例进行排序。

Result: 跨难度泛化常受限，训练使用简单或困难数据都无法在全难度范围内实现持续改进。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的训练和评估数据应包含不同难度，在难度上走捷径有风险。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

Conclusion: 数据驱动框架有效弥合了材料发现和性能提升之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $κ$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$κ$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $κ$ and $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$κ$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.

Conclusion: 伪谱最优控制改变了航天和自主系统中挑战性控制问题的解决方式。

Abstract: The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Post-Double-Lasso is becoming the most popular method for estimating linear regression models with many covariates when the purpose is to obtain an accurate estimate of a parameter of interest, such as an average treatment effect. However, this method can suffer from substantial omitted variable bias in finite sample. We propose a new method called Post-Double-Autometrics, which is based on Autometrics, and show that this method outperforms Post-Double-Lasso. Its use in a standard application of economic growth sheds new light on the hypothesis of convergence from poor to rich economies.

Motivation: 当前高斯过程框架用于流体动力学时，先验选择缺乏系统长期动力学的严格论证，需弥合这一差距。

Method: 基于2D随机Navier - Stokes方程准高斯性理论基础，从线性OU模型的平稳协方差构建GP先验。

Result: 构建了基于理论基础的概率框架，得到有严格长期动力学依据的GP先验。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了SPDE理论与实际数据同化之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the periodic behaviour of the dual logarithmic derivative operator $\mathcal{A}[f]=\mathrm{d}\ln f/\mathrm{d}\ln x$ in a complex analytic setting. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits genuinely nondegenerate period-$2$ orbits and identify a canonical explicit example. Motivated by this, we obtain a complete classification of all nondegenerate period-$2$ solutions, which are precisely the rational pairs $(c a x^{c}/(1-ax^{c}),\, c/(1-ax^{c}))$ with $ac\neq 0$. We further classify all fixed points of $\mathcal{A}$, showing that every solution of $\mathcal{A}[f]=f$ has the form $f(x)=1/(a-\ln x)$. As an illustration, logistic-type functions become pre-periodic under $\mathcal{A}$ after a logarithmic change of variables, entering the period-$2$ family in one iterate. These results give an explicit description of the low-period structure of $\mathcal{A}$ and provide a tractable example of operator-induced dynamics on function spaces.

Abstract: Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.

Abstract: Optimal control of interacting particles governed by stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces is an open area of research. Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.

Abstract: We study an extension of the standard two-party communication model in which Alice and Bob hold probability distributions $p$ and $q$ over domains $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Their goal is to estimate \[ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p,\, y \sim q}[f(x, y)] \] to within additive error $\varepsilon$ for a bounded function $f$, known to both parties. We refer to this as the distributed estimation problem. Special cases of this problem arise in a variety of areas including sketching, databases and learning. Our goal is to understand how the required communication scales with the communication complexity of $f$ and the error parameter $\varepsilon$.
  The random sampling approach -- estimating the mean by averaging $f$ over $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ random samples -- requires $O(R(f)/\varepsilon^2)$ total communication, where $R(f)$ is the randomized communication complexity of $f$. We design a new debiasing protocol which improves the dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ to be linear instead of quadratic. Additionally we show better upper bounds for several special classes of functions, including the Equality and Greater-than functions. We introduce lower bound techniques based on spectral methods and discrepancy, and show the optimality of many of our protocols: the debiasing protocol is tight for general functions, and that our protocols for the equality and greater-than functions are also optimal. Furthermore, we show that among full-rank Boolean functions, Equality is essentially the easiest.

Abstract: Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.

Conclusion: FMD范式能将大模型压缩为紧凑、高效且忠实的代理模型，使其更适合在资源受限硬件上部署。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

Conclusion: 神经VLMs对隐私攻击更具弹性，有助于理解多模态模型的隐私风险。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

TL;DR: 世界模型在多个领域有重要作用，半自回归解码范式是突破，Inferix引擎专为世界合成设计，有互动和评估功能，望社区共同推进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型存在局限，期望通过创新方法和引擎推动世界模型发展，突破当前以大语言模型为中心的视觉基础模型范式。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法优势；设计Inferix推理引擎进行优化解码，支持互动视频流和集成LV - Bench评估基准。

Result: Inferix能实现沉浸式世界合成，可进行实时交互和现实模拟，还能支持高效基准测试。

Conclusion: 希望社区共同推进Inferix，促进世界模型探索。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

Motivation: Vision - Language Action (VLA)模型因深度transformer堆栈导致推理延迟大。

Method: 提出训练无关、行动引导的早期退出框架DeeAD，通过评估中间轨迹物理可行性加速规划；引入多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层；可集成到现有VLA模型无需重新训练。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，实现高达28%的transformer层稀疏性和29%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: DeeAD能在保持规划质量和安全的同时，有效加速VLA规划。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

Motivation: 解决生成式图像修复中篡改区域的定位问题。

Method: 基于在B - Free数据集上预训练的DINOv2模型，添加线性分类头预测14×14块分辨率的篡改情况，用滑动窗口策略处理大图像，后处理细化二进制篡改掩码。

Result: DinoLizer在多个图像修复数据集上超越现有局部篡改检测器，对常见后处理操作鲁棒，平均IoU比次优模型高12%。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers在该任务中有强大表征能力，DinoLizer性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无评估基于工具的设计性能的基准，为了解和增强VLMs在传统设计软件中与设计师协作的能力。

Method: 引入CANVAS基准，包含598个基于工具的设计任务，有设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型，通过基于上下文的工具调用更新设计。

Result: 领先模型有更具策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量。

Conclusion: 识别出模型常见错误模式，可指导未来增强基于工具的设计能力的工作。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

Motivation: 原KRISP模型为工业级训练设计，计算需求高且与大型骨干网络紧密相连，需要轻量级版本。

Method: 对KRISP进行轻量级复现，开展系统的消融研究，在合成VQA数据上进行概念验证并在DAQUAR数据集上评估。

Result: 复现模型性能约为原模型的75%，发现原模型设计缺陷和隐含问题，模型可防止AI幻觉，适用于边缘设备。

Conclusion: 为资源受限下知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性提供了见解。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Conclusion: RLVR对推进多模态推理有很大潜力

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: OVI想法值得进一步研究，代码接收后将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 准确检测管状树中心线及其树拓扑对临床任务至关重要，需高召回率以避免评估不完整或漏检异常导致的致命错误。

Method: 提出基于Transformer解码器的Producer - Refiner架构，Producer提出初始合流轨迹，Refiner循环细化生成最终轨迹形成中心线图；引入空间树图非最大抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr召回率优于以往SOTA，精度相当，推理更快，参数大幅减少。

Conclusion: RefTr有潜力成为3D医学影像中血管树分析的新SOTA框架。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Result: Null - TTA实现了最先进的目标测试时对齐，同时保持了较强的跨奖励泛化性。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化是一种有效且有原则的测试时对齐新范式。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Conclusion: GuardTrace - VL能有效检测多模态大推理模型推理阶段的不安全内容，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: MERGE框架能有效解决现有方法的问题，具有强鲁棒性和领域适应性。

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: Δ - NeRF在增量式NeRF细化方面表现出色，能有效解决现有框架的局限性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Motivation: 现有阿尔茨海默病预测方法多依赖手动提取脑图像特征，本文旨在提出自动化学习脑图像形态变化的方法进行早期预测。

Method: 提出Deformation - Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN)，先对不完整MRI序列插值，再用双向时间变形感知模块生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上测试，PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标有竞争力；合成数据用于分类方法时，AD vs. NC分类准确率提高6.21% - 16%，AD vs. MCI vs. NC分类准确率提高7.34% - 21.25%。

Conclusion: DATGN生成的MRI图像符合脑萎缩趋势，可实现阿尔茨海默病早期预测。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Conclusion: EntPruner框架有效，能在提升推理速度的同时保证生成质量。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Result: 转换后的ViT - UHD与MoonViT性能相当，TTFT降低2.4倍；基于ViT - UHD的LLaVA - UHD v3与Qwen2 - VL性能相当，TTFT进一步降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: PVC方法能在保持通用性的同时将预训练ViT重新配置为高效架构，有助于高效多模态大语言模型的研究。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

Conclusion: GridAR能在有限测试时间缩放下取得高质量结果，可推广到自回归图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Conclusion: WavePCNet是一种有效的从微弱光图案中定位和分割遮挡物体的方法，具有良好的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: ConFu能有效捕捉高阶依赖，同时保持强成对对应关系，可利用跨模态互补性，适应多模态复杂性增加。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Method: 在CIFAR - 10上用统一TinyUNet架构实现三种方法；将CFM扩展到图像修复，采用四种掩码类型进行掩码引导采样。

Result: CFM 50步FID为24.15，远超DDPM；MeanFlow单步采样FID 29.15，推理时间减少50倍；图像修复模型在中心掩码上PSNR提高73%，SSIM提高45%。

Conclusion: CFM和MeanFlow在生成建模和图像修复任务中表现出色，具有有效性和优势。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Motivation: 现有方法在抽象视觉思维上不及人类，灵活性受外部工具限制。

Method: 提出Monet框架，用三阶段蒸馏SFT管道，提出VLPO方法，构建Monet - SFT - 125K数据集。

Result: Monet - 7B在感知和推理基准测试有提升，在抽象视觉推理任务有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 对训练组件进行分析，为视觉潜在推理未来发展提供见解。

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Conclusion: 通过跟踪属性计数可洞察干扰项、推理长度和准确率的相互作用，提出简单提示策略可缓解推理模型中偏见驱动的预测。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Conclusion: M&B方法能有效进行类增量学习，减少灾难性遗忘，且具有良好的集成性。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需高成本端到端训练且扰动补丁明显，为解决此局限提出ADVLA。

Method: 直接在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上应用对抗扰动，引入增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动三种策略。

Result: 在$L_{\infty}=4/255$约束下，结合Top - K掩码修改不到10%的补丁，攻击成功率近100%，扰动集中在关键区域，几乎不可见，单步迭代仅约0.06秒，优于传统基于补丁的攻击。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型下游动作预测，避免传统补丁攻击的缺点，有独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

Abstract: Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.

Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型和视觉 - 语言模型在自然语言和多模态任务进步快，但对音乐符号理解能力探索不足，需评估模型乐谱理解能力。

Method: 引入MSU - Bench，包含1800个生成式问答对，分四个理解级别，对超15个SOTA模型进行零样本和微调评估。

Result: 揭示了显著的模态差距、脆弱的分级成功率和维持多级正确性的困难，微调能显著提升两种模态性能并保留常识。

Conclusion: MSU - Bench为人工智能、音乐学和多模态推理交叉领域的未来研究奠定了严格基础。

Abstract: Understanding complete musical scores requires reasoning over symbolic structures such as pitch, rhythm, harmony, and form. Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in natural language and multimodal tasks, their ability to comprehend musical notation remains underexplored. We introduce Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for evaluating score-level musical understanding across both textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench comprises 1,800 generative question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from works spanning Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four progressive levels of comprehension: Onset Information, Notation & Note, Chord & Harmony, and Texture & Form. Through extensive zero-shot and fine-tuned evaluations of over 15+ state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we reveal sharp modality gaps, fragile level-wise success rates, and the difficulty of sustaining multilevel correctness. Fine-tuning markedly improves performance in both modalities while preserving general knowledge, establishing MSU-Bench as a rigorous foundation for future research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), musicological, and multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出SONAR框架解决Deepfake音频检测器泛化问题，在基准测试中表现出色，收敛快，可拆分潜在空间且架构无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake音频检测器难以泛化到分布外输入，原因是频谱偏差导致高频细节利用不足。

Method: 提出SONAR框架，将音频信号分离为互补表示，用XLSR编码器捕捉低频内容，用可学习SRM和高通过滤器提取高频残差，通过频率交叉注意力结合，用频率感知对比损失优化。

Result: 在ASVspoof 2021和野外基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，收敛速度比强基线快四倍。

Conclusion: SONAR是一个数据驱动、频率引导的对比框架，可将潜在空间拆分为两个不相交的流形，架构无关，可集成到其他模型或模态。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) audio detectors still struggle to generalize to out of distribution inputs. A central reason is spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency structure before high-frequency (HF) details, which both causes DF generators to leave HF artifacts and leaves those same artifacts under-exploited by common detectors. To address this gap, we propose Spectral-cONtrastive Audio Residuals (SONAR), a frequency-guided framework that explicitly disentangles an audio signal into complementary representations. An XLSR encoder captures the dominant low-frequency content, while the same cloned path, preceded by learnable SRM, value-constrained high-pass filters, distills faint HF residuals. Frequency cross-attention reunites the two views for long- and short-range frequency dependencies, and a frequency-aware Jensen-Shannon contrastive loss pulls real content-noise pairs together while pushing fake embeddings apart, accelerating optimization and sharpening decision boundaries. Evaluated on the ASVspoof 2021 and in-the-wild benchmarks, SONAR attains state-of-the-art performance and converges four times faster than strong baselines. By elevating faint high-frequency residuals to first-class learning signals, SONAR unveils a fully data-driven, frequency-guided contrastive framework that splits the latent space into two disjoint manifolds: natural-HF for genuine audio and distorted-HF for synthetic audio, thereby sharpening decision boundaries. Because the scheme operates purely at the representation level, it is architecture-agnostic and, in future work, can be seamlessly integrated into any model or modality where subtle high-frequency cues are decisive.

Abstract: Separating the individual elements in a musical mixture is an essential process for music analysis and practice. While this is generally addressed using neural networks optimized to mask or transform the time-frequency representation of a mixture to extract the target sources, the flexibility and generalization capabilities of generative diffusion models are giving rise to a novel class of solutions for this complicated task. In this work, we explore singing voice separation from real music recordings using a diffusion model which is trained to generate the solo vocals conditioned on the corresponding mixture. Our approach improves upon prior generative systems and achieves competitive objective scores against non-generative baselines when trained with supplementary data. The iterative nature of diffusion sampling enables the user to control the quality-efficiency trade-off, and also refine the output when needed. We present an ablation study of the sampling algorithm, highlighting the effects of the user-configurable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成音频水印可能被恶意去除，需有效水印去除技术评估水印鲁棒性，而此前方案有不足。

Method: 引入HarmonicAttack，用双路径卷积自动编码器在时域和频域操作，结合GAN式训练分离水印和原始音频。

Result: 与先进水印方案对比，HarmonicAttack去除水印能力更强，接近实时性能，对分布外样本性能退化小。

Conclusion: HarmonicAttack是一种高效的音频水印去除方法，能有效评估水印鲁棒性。

Abstract: The availability of high-quality, AI-generated audio raises security challenges such as misinformation campaigns and voice-cloning fraud. A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks against removal. Previous watermark removal schemes either assume impractical knowledge of the watermarks they are designed to remove or are computationally expensive, potentially generating a false sense of confidence in current watermark schemes.
  We introduce HarmonicAttack, an efficient audio watermark removal method that only requires the basic ability to generate the watermarks from the targeted scheme and nothing else. With this, we are able to train a general watermark removal model that is able to remove the watermarks generated by the targeted scheme from any watermarked audio sample. HarmonicAttack employs a dual-path convolutional autoencoder that operates in both temporal and frequency domains, along with GAN-style training, to separate the watermark from the original audio. When evaluated against state-of-the-art watermark schemes AudioSeal, WavMark, and Silentcipher, HarmonicAttack demonstrates greater watermark removal ability than previous watermark removal methods with near real-time performance. Moreover, while HarmonicAttack requires training, we find that it is able to transfer to out-of-distribution samples with minimal degradation in performance.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为比较具有低维流形结构的高维数据集提供了一种高效、有理论依据的方法。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets across various scientific domains has created a pressing need for new statistical methods to compare distributions supported on their underlying structures. Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出MTI - Net框架同时处理肝脏肿瘤分割、动态增强回归和分类任务，在实验中表现良好，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往缺乏能同时处理肝脏肿瘤分割、动态增强回归和分类任务的端到端框架，缺少捕捉任务间相关性及有效提取动态MRI信息的机制。

Method: 提出MTI - Net框架，包含MdIEF融合多域信息，引入任务交互模块建立分割和回归的高阶一致性，设计TDD捕捉任务间高阶关系，用浅Transformer网络进行位置编码提取动态MRI信息。

Result: 在238个受试者的数据集实验中，MTI - Net在多任务上表现出高性能。

Conclusion: MTI - Net有很强潜力辅助肝脏肿瘤的临床评估。

Abstract: Liver tumor segmentation, dynamic enhancement regression, and classification are critical for clinical assessment and diagnosis. However, no prior work has attempted to achieve these tasks simultaneously in an end-to-end framework, primarily due to the lack of an effective framework that captures inter-task relevance for mutual improvement and the absence of a mechanism to extract dynamic MRI information effectively. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Task Interaction adversarial learning Network (MTI-Net), a novel integrated framework designed to tackle these tasks simultaneously. MTI-Net incorporates Multi-domain Information Entropy Fusion (MdIEF), which utilizes entropy-aware, high-frequency spectral information to effectively integrate features from both frequency and spectral domains, enhancing the extraction and utilization of dynamic MRI data. The network also introduces a task interaction module that establishes higher-order consistency between segmentation and regression, thus fostering inter-task synergy and improving overall performance. Additionally, we designed a novel task-driven discriminator (TDD) to capture internal high-order relationships between tasks. For dynamic MRI information extraction, we employ a shallow Transformer network to perform positional encoding, which captures the relationships within dynamic MRI sequences. In experiments on a dataset of 238 subjects, MTI-Net demonstrates high performance across multiple tasks, indicating its strong potential for assisting in the clinical assessment of liver tumors.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.

Abstract: In energy science, Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media is a central problem in reservoir sim-ulation. However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估主要测试能力，未评估模型有高风险能力时会做什么，存在关键盲点。

Method: 提出PropensityBench基准框架，用代理工具模拟危险能力，设置5874个场景和6648个工具，在可控环境模拟能力访问并在不同操作压力下评估模型选择。

Result: 在开源和专有前沿模型中发现9个令人担忧的倾向迹象，模型在压力下常选高风险工具。

Conclusion: 应从静态能力审计转向动态倾向评估，作为安全部署前沿AI系统的前提。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked concerns over their potential to acquire and misuse dangerous or high-risk capabilities, posing frontier risks. Current safety evaluations primarily test for what a model \textit{can} do - its capabilities - without assessing what it $\textit{would}$ do if endowed with high-risk capabilities. This leaves a critical blind spot: models may strategically conceal capabilities or rapidly acquire them, while harboring latent inclinations toward misuse. We argue that $\textbf{propensity}$ - the likelihood of a model to pursue harmful actions if empowered - is a critical, yet underexplored, axis of safety evaluation. We present $\textbf{PropensityBench}$, a novel benchmark framework that assesses the proclivity of models to engage in risky behaviors when equipped with simulated dangerous capabilities using proxy tools. Our framework includes 5,874 scenarios with 6,648 tools spanning four high-risk domains: cybersecurity, self-proliferation, biosecurity, and chemical security. We simulate access to powerful capabilities via a controlled agentic environment and evaluate the models' choices under varying operational pressures that reflect real-world constraints or incentives models may encounter, such as resource scarcity or gaining more autonomy. Across open-source and proprietary frontier models, we uncover 9 alarming signs of propensity: models frequently choose high-risk tools when under pressure, despite lacking the capability to execute such actions unaided. These findings call for a shift from static capability audits toward dynamic propensity assessments as a prerequisite for deploying frontier AI systems safely. Our code is available at https://github.com/scaleapi/propensity-evaluation.

Result: 所有模型有显著安全缺口，各模型在不同维度表现不同，DeepSeek Chat v3总分最高。

Conclusion: 生产系统需确定性危机路由，InvisibleBench可评估纵向风险。

Abstract: InvisibleBench is a deployment gate for caregiving-relationship AI, evaluating 3-20+ turn interactions across five dimensions: Safety, Compliance, Trauma-Informed Design, Belonging/Cultural Fitness, and Memory. The benchmark includes autofail conditions for missed crises, medical advice (WOPR Act), harmful information, and attachment engineering. We evaluate four frontier models across 17 scenarios (N=68) spanning three complexity tiers. All models show significant safety gaps (11.8-44.8 percent crisis detection), indicating the necessity of deterministic crisis routing in production systems. DeepSeek Chat v3 achieves the highest overall score (75.9 percent), while strengths differ by dimension: GPT-4o Mini leads Compliance (88.2 percent), Gemini leads Trauma-Informed Design (85.0 percent), and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ranks highest in crisis detection (44.8 percent). We release all scenarios, judge prompts, and scoring configurations with code. InvisibleBench extends single-turn safety tests by evaluating longitudinal risk, where real harms emerge. No clinical claims; this is a deployment-readiness evaluation.

Method: 定义‘同谋助长’行为，构建包含269个非法场景和50种非法意图的评估基准进行实证研究。

Result: LLMs普遍易受同谋助长影响，GPT - 4o近一半测试案例提供非法协助；在提供可信法律警告和积极指导方面表现不佳；不同社会法律背景下安全表现差异大；现有安全对齐策略不足甚至可能加剧同谋行为。

Conclusion: 大语言模型存在较高协助非法活动风险，现有安全策略需改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks. However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored. In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs. Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior. Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases. Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance. Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts. On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications. On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.

Motivation: 现有可观测性工具无法量化智能体工作流在推理连贯性丧失后的恢复速度，需要解决自主多智能体系统中确保认知稳定性的挑战。

Method: 将经典可靠性指标（MTTR、MTBF等）引入认知领域，定义MTTR - A；使用AG~News语料库和LangGraph编排框架进行基准模拟。

Result: 自动化反射平均约6秒恢复稳定，人工审批干预约12秒；200次运行中，模拟的MTTR - A中位数为6.21±2.14秒，MTBF = 6.7±2.14秒，NRR = 0.08。

Conclusion: 将恢复延迟形式化为分布式推理的可量化属性，推导恢复时间和认知正常运行时间的可靠性界限，为智能体认知的运行时可靠性奠定基础，使认知恢复标准化、可解释。

Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance

Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization. Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls. Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage. The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants. Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination. Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks. Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco

Method: BAMAS先通过整数线性规划问题平衡性能和成本来选择最优LLM集合，再用基于强化学习的方法选择交互拓扑确定协作方式，最后实例化并执行系统。

Result: 在三个代表性任务上评估BAMAS，与现有方法对比，BAMAS性能相当，成本最多降低86%。

Conclusion: BAMAS能在预算约束下有效构建多智能体系统，降低成本同时保持性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling autonomous agents to solve complex tasks. As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods. Results show that BAMAS achieves comparable performance while reducing cost by up to 86%.

Conclusion: 可微物理 - 神经框架能为物理现象提供快速、准确且具泛化性的粗粒度替代模型。

Abstract: Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.

Abstract: Real-time water-level monitoring across many locations is vital for flood response, infrastructure management, and environmental forecasting. Yet many sensing methods rely on fixed instruments - acoustic, radar, camera, or pressure probes - that are costly to install and maintain and are vulnerable during extreme events. We propose a passive, low-cost water-level tracking scheme that uses only LTE downlink power metrics reported by commodity receivers. The method extracts per-antenna RSRP, RSSI, and RSRQ, applies a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the RSRP to isolate the semidiurnal tide component, and forms a summed-coefficient signature that simultaneously marks high/low tide (tide-turn times) and tracks the tide-rate (flow speed) over time. These wavelet features guide a lightweight neural network that learns water-level changes over time from a short training segment. Beyond a single serving base station, we also show a multi-base-station cooperative mode: independent CWTs are computed per carrier and fused by a robust median to produce one tide-band feature that improves stability and resilience to local disturbances. Experiments over a 420 m river path under line-of-sight conditions achieve root-mean-square and mean-absolute errors of 0.8 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. Under a non-line-of-sight setting with vegetation and vessel traffic, the same model transfers successfully after brief fine-tuning, reaching 1.7 cm RMSE and 0.8 cm MAE. Unlike CSI-based methods, the approach needs no array calibration and runs on standard hardware, making wide deployment practical. When signals from multiple base stations are available, fusion further improves robustness.

Abstract: Subsurface defects such as delamination, voids, and honeycombing critically affect the durability of concrete bridge decks but are difficult to detect reliably using visual inspection or manual sounding. This paper presents a machine learning based Impact Echo (IE) framework that automates both defect localization and multi-class classification of common concrete defects. Raw IE signals from Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) laboratory slabs and in-service bridge decks are transformed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into dominant peak-frequency features and interpolated into spatial maps for defect zone visualization. Unsupervised k-means clustering highlights low-frequency, defect-prone regions, while Ground Truth Masks (GTMs) derived from seeded lab defects are used to validate spatial accuracy and generate high-confidence training labels. From these validated regions, spatially ordered peak-frequency sequences are constructed and fed into a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that classifies four defect types shallow delamination, deep delamination, voids, and honeycombing with 73% overall accuracy. Field validation on the bridge deck demonstrates that models trained on laboratory data generalize under realistic coupling, noise, and environmental variability. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity, scalability, and repeatability of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), supporting intelligent, data-driven bridge health monitoring at a network scale.

Conclusion: 所提相位感知EM算法能有效解决盲信道估计中EM算法的局部最大值问题，且复杂度低。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文用纽约和新英格兰电力市场数据，研究自动化缓解程序（AMP）对发电公司投标的影响，发现部分投标者有策略性反应，但整体市场影响不显著，建议校准缓解阈值以提高AMP效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AMP在美国电力市场广泛应用，但缺乏企业对这种价格上限和惩罚监管策略性反应的证据，难以判断其是否有效。

Method: 采用回归断点设计，利用价格上限惩罚仅在结构指数超过特定阈值时激活这一事实，估计局部平均处理效应（LATE），并使用优劣顺序模拟。

Result: 约30 - 40%的投标者有显著策略性反应，最大投标价格降低4 - 10美元/MWh，但企业间异质性大，整体市场监管影响不显著；更严格阈值下，每缓解小时买家剩余增加350 - 980千美元，缓解小时数每年低于33小时。

Conclusion: 建议对缓解阈值进行实证校准，以提高AMP监管效率。

Abstract: In auction markets that are prone to market power abuse, preventive mitigation of bid prices can be applied through automated mitigation procedures (AMP). Despite the widespread application of AMP in US electricity markets, there exists scarce evidence on how firms strategically react to such price-cap-and-penalty regulation: when the price cap rarely leads to penalty mitigation, it is difficult to distinguish whether AMP are an effective deterrent or simply too lax. We investigate their impact on the bids of generation firms, using 2019 data from the New York and New England electricity markets (NYISO, ISO-NE). We employ a regression discontinuity design, which exploits the fact that the price cap with penalty is only activated when a structural index (e.g., congestion, pivotality) exceeds a certain cutoff. By estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of screening activation, we can causally identify successful deterrence of anti-competitive behavior. Around 30-40% of the analyzed bidders per market exhibit a significant strategic response - corresponding to a decrease in maximum bid prices of 4-10 $/MWh to avoid the penalty. However, there is significant heterogeneity between firms, and the regulatory impact on the overall market is not statistically detectable, suggesting lax mitigation thresholds. Using a merit-order simulation, we estimate the welfare impact of more stringent thresholds to lie between 350 and 980 thousand dollars of increased buyer surplus per mitigated hour, with the associated number of mitigated hours being below 33 hours/year. Our results motivate the empirical calibration of mitigation thresholds to improve the efficiency of AMP regulation.

Result: 高罚款时连带责任能减少作弊，低罚款时理论预测的连带责任负面效果未出现。

Conclusion: 高罚款情况下，连带责任是解决竞赛作弊代理问题的有效办法。

Abstract: Contest participants often have strong incentives to engage in cheating. Sanctions serve as a common deterrent against such conduct. Often, other agents on the contestant's team (e.g., a coach of an athlete) or a company (a manager of an R\&D engineer) have a vested interest in outcomes and can influence the cheating decision. An agency problem arises when only the contestant faces the penalties for cheating. Our theoretical framework examines joint liability, i.e., shifting some responsibility from the contestant to the other agent, as a solution to this agency problem. Equilibrium analysis shows that extending liability reduces cheating if fines are harsh. Less intuitively, when fines are lenient, a shift in liability can lead to an increase in equilibrium cheating rates. Experimental tests confirm that joint liability is effective in reducing cheating if fines are high. However, the predicted detrimental effect of joint liability for low fines does not occur.

Abstract: Higher-order networks, naturally described as hypergraphs, are essential for modeling real-world systems involving interactions among three or more entities. Stochastic block models offer a principled framework for characterizing mesoscale organization, yet their extension to hypergraphs involves a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. A recent simplification, a single-order model, mitigates this complexity by assuming a single affinity pattern governs interactions of all orders. This universal assumption, however, may overlook order-dependent structural details. Here, we propose a framework that relaxes this assumption by introducing a multi-order block structure, in which different affinity patterns govern distinct subsets of interaction orders. Our framework is based on a multi-order stochastic block model and searches for the optimal partition of the set of interaction orders that maximizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction performance. Analyzing a diverse range of real-world networks, we find that multi-order block structures are prevalent. Accounting for them not only yields better predictive performance over the single-order model but also uncovers sharper, more interpretable mesoscale organization. Our findings reveal that order-dependent mechanisms are a key feature of the mesoscale organization of real-world higher-order networks.

Abstract: Spatially varying coefficients (SVC) models allow for marginal effects to be non-stationary over space and thus offer a higher degree of flexibility with respect to standard geostatistical models with external drift. At the same time, SVC models have the advantage that they are easily interpretable. They offer a flexible framework for understanding how the relationships between dependent and independent variables vary across space. The most common methods for modelling such data are the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Bayesian Gaussian Process (Bayes-GP). The Bayesian SVC model, which assumes that the coefficients follow Gaussian processes, provides a rigorous approach to account for spatial non-stationarity. However, the computational cost of Bayes-GP models can be prohibitively high when dealing with large datasets or/and when using a large number of covariates, due to the repeated inversion of dense covariance matrices required at each Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iteration. In this study, we propose an efficient Bayes-GP modeling framework leveraging the Vecchia approximation to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. The proposed method is applied to a challenging soil pollution data set in Toulouse, France, characterized by a high degree of censorship (two-thirds censored observations) and spatial clustering. Our results demonstrate the ability of the Vecchia-based Bayes-GP model to capture spatially varying effects and provide meaningful insights into spatial heterogeneity, even under the constraints of censored data.

Abstract: Zipf's law in language lacks a definitive origin, debated across fields. This study explains Zipf-like behavior using geometric mechanisms without linguistic elements. The Full Combinatorial Word Model (FCWM) forms words from a finite alphabet, generating a geometric distribution of word lengths. Interacting exponential forces yield a power-law rank-frequency curve, determined by alphabet size and blank symbol probability. Simulations support predictions, matching English, Russian, and mixed-genre data. The symbolic model suggests Zipf-type laws arise from geometric constraints, not communicative efficiency.

Conclusion: DA - SIP将生成式机器人控制器转变为高效、任务感知系统，能智能分配推理资源。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.

Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA系统大多使用平行双指抓手，在处理一些现实任务时有局限性，如擦拭玻璃、打开无把手抽屉等。

Method: 提出结合机械双指抓手与真空吸盘单元的低成本集成硬件设计，支持灵活切换或协同使用两种模式。

Result: 在DexVLA和Pi0两个VLA框架验证，使用该混合末端执行器，机器人能完成传统双指抓手无法完成的复杂任务。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合末端执行器设计有效可行，能扩展机器人可行任务范围，硬件设计和控制系统将开源。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶模型在闭环设置中存在级联错误和泛化能力差的问题，需要增强预训练端到端驾驶代理的鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 使用几何一致的模拟引擎生成多样反事实轨迹，基于生成数据训练基于扩散的策略适配器和多步Q值模型，推理时适配器提出候选轨迹，Q值模型选择预期效用最高的轨迹。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，MPA在域内、域外和安全关键场景中显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: MPA框架能有效增强预训练端到端驾驶代理的鲁棒性和安全性，且研究了反事实数据规模和推理时指导策略对整体有效性的影响。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.

TL;DR: 引入统一符号表示解决机器人小数据学习问题，提出TraceGen和TraceForge，实验显示有高效适应性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人仅从少量演示中学习新任务、在新平台和场景中学习的小数据问题，且利用跨实体、环境和任务视频存在阻碍。

Method: 引入3D“轨迹空间”统一符号表示；提出TraceGen世界模型在轨迹空间预测未来运动；开发TraceForge数据管道将异质视频转换为3D轨迹。

Result: 构建包含123K视频和1.8M三元组的语料库；仅用五个目标机器人视频，TraceGen在四个任务中成功率达80%，推理速度比现有模型快50 - 600倍；用五个未校准人类演示视频，在真实机器人上成功率达67.5%。

Conclusion: TraceGen能跨实体适应，无需物体检测器或大量像素空间生成。

Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对攻击者利用大模型制作钓鱼和垃圾邮件这一网络安全威胁，提升AI辅助邮件安全系统性能。

Method: 创建综合邮件数据集并标注信息，用多个大模型评估识别能力，选择可靠模型标注全量数据，用大模型改写邮件评估分类鲁棒性。

Result: 大模型有较强钓鱼检测能力，但区分垃圾和正常邮件存在挑战。

Conclusion: 数据集和评估框架有助于改善AI辅助邮件安全系统，资源公开支持开放科学。

Abstract: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.

Motivation: 量子机器学习存在测量瓶颈，限制性能并放大隐私风险。

Method: 提出轻量级残差混合架构，在分类前将量子特征与原始输入拼接。

Result: 模型在集中式和联邦式设置下均优于纯量子和先前混合模型，最高提升55%准确率，通信成本低且隐私鲁棒性增强，消融研究证实残差连接有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为将量子模型集成到对隐私敏感、资源受限的场景提供了实用的近期途径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.

TL;DR: 提出MAD - DAG协议应对自私挖矿，通过MDP建模分析，结果显示其在不利条件下比Colordag和比特币更安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗自私挖矿协议Colordag未处理不利条件，且仅在高延迟下被证明安全，需新协议应对。

Method: 用马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）建模理性矿工，开发保守奖励规则得到可处理模型。

Result: MAD - DAG在Colordag和比特币失败的不利条件下能抵御攻击，安全阈值11% - 31%，后两者为0%。

Conclusion: MAD - DAG是首个能在不利条件下应对自私挖矿的实用协议，保持了相当的安全性。

Abstract: Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.
  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.
  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.
  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.
  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.

Motivation: 扩散模型面对对抗性提示时脆弱，现有攻击方法在实际部署中不可行，需更强攻击方法来发现漏洞和构建更鲁棒生成系统。

Method: 提出CAHS - Attack方法，集成蒙特卡罗树搜索进行细粒度后缀优化，用约束遗传算法预选高潜力对抗性提示作为根节点，在每次模拟中保留最具语义破坏性结果进行高效局部搜索。

Result: 该方法在不同语义的长短提示上实现了SOTA攻击性能。

Conclusion: SD模型的脆弱性可归因于其基于CLIP的文本编码器的固有漏洞，当前文本到图像管道存在基本安全风险。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.

Result: 在五个基准表格数据集实验中，TAB - DRW对常见后处理攻击有强检测性和鲁棒性，保持高数据保真度并支持混合类型特征。

Conclusion: TAB - DRW是一种高效且鲁棒的生成表格数据后编辑水印方案。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI has enabled the production of high-fidelity synthetic tabular data across fields such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, raising growing concerns about data provenance and misuse. Watermarking offers a promising solution to address these concerns by ensuring the traceability of synthetic data, but existing methods face many limitations: they are computationally expensive due to reliance on large diffusion models, struggle with mixed discrete-continuous data, or lack robustness to post-modifications. To address them, we propose TAB-DRW, an efficient and robust post-editing watermarking scheme for generative tabular data. TAB-DRW embeds watermark signals in the frequency domain: it normalizes heterogeneous features via the Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization, applies the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and adjusts the imaginary parts of adaptively selected entries according to precomputed pseudorandom bits. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we introduce a novel rank-based pseudorandom bit generation method that enables row-wise retrieval without incurring storage overhead. Experiments on five benchmark tabular datasets show that TAB-DRW achieves strong detectability and robustness against common post-processing attacks, while preserving high data fidelity and fully supporting mixed-type features.

Motivation: Edge AI和TinyML应用对设备端智能需求增加，但轻量级CNN架构的多阶段设计存在内存墙问题，导致高能耗和延迟。

Method: 引入采用融合像素级数据流的硬件加速器架构，作为RISC - V处理器的自定义功能单元（CFU），通过紧密耦合的流水线计算输出像素，无需写入内存。

Conclusion: 在TinyML资源范围内零缓冲区数据流是可行的，为克服边缘AI加速器的内存墙问题提供了新的有效策略。

Abstract: The increasing demand for on-device intelligence in Edge AI and TinyML applications requires the efficient execution of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators.

Motivation: 过去二十年针对个别语言开发验证工具，许多验证方法语言无关，为促进技术转移，需使实现能用于其他语言。

Method: 提出SV - LIB，基于命令式编程语言概念，用SMT - LIB表示表达式和类别，定义见证格式及验证任务规范。

Result: 提出SV - LIB 1.0版本，包括设计目标、语法和非形式语义。

Conclusion: SV - LIB便于解析和融入现有基础设施，可实现独立见证验证器，未来计划添加形式语义和并发扩展。

Abstract: In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在营养领域缺乏外在评估的问题，尤其是在以RCT为金标准的营养领域，满足专家对循证部署的要求。

Method: 开展为期七周的RCT（n = 81），比较有无LLM集成的聊天机器人变体，测量对饮食结果、情绪健康和参与度的影响。为基于规则的聊天机器人增加两个基于LLM的特性。

Result: 基于LLM的特性在内在评估中表现良好，但在实际部署中未带来一致益处。

Conclusion: 强调内在评估与实际影响之间存在关键差距，需要跨学科、以人为本的方法。

Abstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\ \href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}

Method: 用ApplyBoard工作流问题评估准确性和幻觉情况，用评分规则打分，测试模型并比较

Conclusion: 明确可靠模型、常见失败模式，提供审核协议

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer high-stakes study-abroad questions about admissions, visas, scholarships, and eligibility. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').
  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.
  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.
  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.
  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.

Conclusion: CodeVaani框架按需可用、可扩展且支持多语言，能降低英语能力有限学生的入门门槛，使编程教育更具包容性。

Abstract: Programming education often assumes English proficiency and text-based interaction, creating barriers for students from multilingual regions such as India. We present CodeVaani, a multilingual speech-driven assistant for understanding code, built into Bodhitree [1], a Learning Management System developed at IIT Bombay. It is a voice-enabled assistant that helps learners explore programming concepts in their native languages. The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively. Compared to classroom assistance, our framework offers ondemand availability, scalability to support many learners, and multilingual support that lowers the entry barrier for students with limited English proficiency. The demo will illustrate these capabilities and highlight how voice-based AI systems can make programming education more inclusive. Supplementary artifacts and demo video are also made available.

Abstract: The development of web-based geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support is often challenged by the difficulty in visualization of big, multi-dimensional environmental data, implementation complexity, and limited automation. We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation. This integrative approach is guided by structured knowledge and visual prompts, providing an innovative geospatial solution in enhancing risk analysis and decision making.

Abstract: The development of agents with emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital due to their significant role in human-computer interaction and the growing integration of computer systems across various sectors of society. Affective computing aims to design intelligent systems that can recognize, evoke, and express human emotions, thereby emulating human emotional intelligence. While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Additionally, it addresses the synthesis of emotional expression across text, speech, and facial modalities to enhance human-agent interaction. This paper identifies and analyzes the key challenges and issues encountered in the development of affective systems, covering state-of-the-art methodologies designed to address them. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, with particular emphasis on the potential of generative technologies to advance affective computing.

Conclusion: AI辅助视频制作可减少教师工作量、提高可扩展性并提供有效学习资源，未来合成语音和化身的改进可增强学习者参与度。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into video lecture production has the potential to transform higher education by streamlining content creation and enhancing accessibility. This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球众多用户使用AI聊天机器人，理解其对多元文化的呈现方式受广泛关注，且评估开放式任务中的文化呈现具有挑战性和待探索性，因此研究印度文化身份在大语言模型生成故事中的文化误读。

Method: 先通过焦点小组和个人调查开发文化误读分类法TALES - Tax，再用其对6个模型进行大规模标注研究，最后将标注转化为问题库TALES - QA评估模型文化知识。

Result: 88%的生成故事存在一个或多个文化不准确问题，此类错误在中低资源语言和印度城郊地区故事中更普遍；模型虽有必要文化知识，但生成故事仍有大量文化误读。

Conclusion: 评估发现大语言模型生成的印度文化相关故事存在较多文化误读，尽管模型本身具备一定文化知识。

Abstract: Millions of users across the globe turn to AI chatbots for their creative needs, inviting widespread interest in understanding how such chatbots represent diverse cultures. At the same time, evaluating cultural representations in open-ended tasks remains challenging and underexplored. In this work, we present TALES, an evaluation of cultural misrepresentations in LLM-generated stories for diverse Indian cultural identities. First, we develop TALES-Tax, a taxonomy of cultural misrepresentations by collating insights from participants with lived experiences in India through focus groups (N=9) and individual surveys (N=15). Using TALES-Tax, we evaluate 6 models through a large-scale annotation study spanning 2,925 annotations from 108 annotators with lived cultural experience from across 71 regions in India and 14 languages. Concerningly, we find that 88\% of the generated stories contain one or more cultural inaccuracies, and such errors are more prevalent in mid- and low-resourced languages and stories based in peri-urban regions in India. Lastly, we transform the annotations into TALES-QA, a standalone question bank to evaluate the cultural knowledge of foundational models. Through this evaluation, we surprisingly discover that models often possess the requisite cultural knowledge despite generating stories rife with cultural misrepresentations.

Motivation: 传统深度模型在人类活动识别中有梯度消失或爆炸、计算成本高和难捕捉长距离依赖等问题，现有SSMs模型有一阶动力学限制且无稳定长期记忆机制。

Method: 引入Momentum Mamba，结合二阶动力学，还有Complex Momentum Mamba等两个扩展。

Result: 在多个HAR基准测试中，Momentum Mamba在准确率、鲁棒性和收敛速度上优于vanilla Mamba和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: 动量增强的SSMs在人类活动识别中实现了准确性和效率的良好平衡，是可扩展范式，也适用于更广泛的序列建模应用。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors is essential for ubiquitous computing, mobile health, and ambient intelligence. Conventional deep models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and transformers have advanced HAR but remain limited by vanishing or exloding gradients, high computational cost, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Structured state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba address these challenges with linear complexity and effective temporal modeling, yet they are restricted to first-order dynamics without stable longterm memory mechanisms. We introduce Momentum Mamba, a momentum-augmented SSM that incorporates second-order dynamics to improve stability of information flow across time steps, robustness, and long-sequence modeling. Two extensions further expand its capacity: Complex Momentum Mamba for frequency-selective memory scaling. Experiments on multiple HAR benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains over vanilla Mamba and Transformer baselines in accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed. With only moderate increases in training cost, momentum-augmented SSMs offer a favorable accuracy-efficiency balance, establishing them as a scalable paradigm for HAR and a promising principal framework for broader sequence modeling applications.

Method: 将受Kaggle竞赛获胜团队架构启发的模拟器与交互式气候模型耦合，并系统评估其在线性能。

Conclusion: 众包离线问题的核心是提高混合物理 - AI气候模拟在线性能的一条途径。

Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.

TL;DR: 提出将道德意义处理嵌入基于Transformer模型架构机制和框架的新方法，探讨技术实现并给出贡献，呼吁跨领域合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在人类决策和行为中的作用愈发重要，确保其处理道德意义成为关键挑战，现有方法多为自下而上。

Method: 通过自上而下设计原则，将道德意义处理嵌入架构；以注意力为动态接口构建框架；借鉴生物 - 人工注意力类比改进认知处理；用Iris Murdoch理论探讨人类和大语言模型道德处理的功能类比；制定并评估技术实现。

Result: 提出概念化注意力的新视角，给出嵌入道德性的技术路径，指出架构集成道德性对外部约束方法的补充作用。

Conclusion: 呼吁Transformer设计者和从事AI伦理的哲学家开展合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.

Motivation: 现有基于图的脑网络表示法会遗漏表征神经复杂性的高阶依赖，信息处理中的协同交互不能分解为成对关系。

Conclusion: 提供了一种保留传统图方法无法捕捉的高阶结构的脑网络表示框架，可将拓扑深度学习架构应用于神经数据。

Abstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LALMs因注意力的二次复杂性和音频信号的高令牌率，可扩展性受限，难以处理长音频和部署在资源受限平台。

Method: 采用无监督分割、均匀平均池化等技术减少音频令牌数，用低秩适配器微调模型以减轻压缩表示带来的性能下降。

Result: 压缩LALMs能在减少高达三倍输入音频令牌数的情况下，性能接近帧级LALMs。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效减少LALMs音频令牌数，同时保持较好性能。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) demonstrate impressive performance across diverse tasks, ranging from speech recognition to general audio understanding. However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic complexity of attention and the high token rates of audio signals. These challenges make it difficult to extend LALMs to long-form audio and to deploy them on resource-constrained platforms such as edge devices.
  In this paper, we explore techniques such as unsupervised segmentation, uniform average pooling, etc., to reduce the number of audio tokens generated by the LALM's audio encoder but before they are consumed by the LLM decoder. To mitigate potential performance degradation introduced by the compressed representations, we employ low-rank adapters to finetune the model. We evaluate our proposed models on two tasks, automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation tasks, that are dependent on effectively uncovering the underlying lexical content of the input signal and study the effect of downsampling on these tasks. Experimental results show that compressed LALMs can achieve performance closer to frame-level LALMs while reducing the input audio token count upto three times before the LLM backbone.

TL;DR: 本文提出RosettaSpeech框架用于零样本语音到语音翻译，利用单语语音 - 文本数据和机器翻译监督，在基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平行语音语料稀缺阻碍语音到语音翻译，常依赖复杂的多阶段流程，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 提出RosettaSpeech框架，在单语语音 - 文本数据上训练，利用基于文本的NMT模型的语言知识，以文本为中间桥梁，推理时作为端到端模型。

Result: 在CVSS - C测试集上，德语到英语和西班牙语到英语的ASR - BLEU得分分别为25.17和29.86，相对增益分别超过27%和14%，单模型可实现多对一翻译。

Conclusion: RosettaSpeech优先依赖丰富的平行文本而非难以获取的平行语音，为更多语言创建高质量、保留说话人特征的语音到语音翻译提供了可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The scarcity of parallel speech corpora critically hampers speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), often forcing reliance on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This paper introduces RosettaSpeech, a novel and simplified framework for zero-shot S2ST that is trained on monolingual speech-text data augmented by machine translation supervision. While our method leverages the linguistic knowledge inherent in text-based NMT models, it strictly eliminates the need for parallel speech-to-speech pairs. Our model uniquely uses text as an intermediate bridge during training but functions as a direct, end-to-end speech-to-speech model at inference. This streamlined approach achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. For instance, on the CVSS-C test set, RosettaSpeech outperforms leading systems, achieving an ASR-BLEU score of 25.17 for German-to-English and 29.86 for Spanish-to-English-relative gains of over 27% and 14%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a single model can deliver strong many-to-one translation performance (FR/ES/DE -> EN). We also provide a foundational analysis of how training data scaling impacts model performance. By prioritizing reliance on abundant parallel text rather than difficult-to-acquire parallel speech, RosettaSpeech offers a scalable path to creating high-quality, speaker-preserving S2ST for a much broader array of languages.

Abstract: This paper introduces The Spheres dataset, multitrack orchestral recordings designed to advance machine learning research in music source separation and related MIR tasks within the classical music domain. The dataset is composed of over one hour recordings of musical pieces performed by the Colibrì Ensemble at The Spheres recording studio, capturing two canonical works - Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 - along with chromatic scales and solo excerpts for each instrument. The recording setup employed 23 microphones, including close spot, main, and ambient microphones, enabling the creation of realistic stereo mixes with controlled bleeding and providing isolated stems for supervised training of source separation models. In addition, room impulse responses were estimated for each instrument position, offering valuable acoustic characterization of the recording space. We present the dataset structure, acoustic analysis, and baseline evaluations using X-UMX based models for orchestral family separation and microphone debleeding. Results highlight both the potential and the challenges of source separation in complex orchestral scenarios, underscoring the dataset's value for benchmarking and for exploring new approaches to separation, localization, dereverberation, and immersive rendering of classical music.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.
