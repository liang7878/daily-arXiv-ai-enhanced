We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying\nthe popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its\nmultiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was\nrecently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this\nguarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances\nwith additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for\nrestricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025))\nor three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).\n  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving\napproximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial\nallocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of\nenvious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial\nallocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and\nPareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently\nestablished in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate\nthe strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified\nproofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii)\n2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice\nthe number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances. We expect this\nframework to have broader applications in approximate-EFX due to its simplicity\nand generality."}

It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional\ntime-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach\nentails \"doing with fewer resources\" under conditions of \"reduced performance\".\nNonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster\nsizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related\nto the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially\nacceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art,\nidentify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared\nComputing, and outline key research directions."}

Aims: Create a benchmark dataset\nto evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of\nSRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in\nsoftware engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research\nartifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset.\nUsing the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results:\nWe present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation)\ndataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary\nstudies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed\nsimilarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies\nare greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is\nrelatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive\nmodel. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the\nscreening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet\nrecommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy\nvaries widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with\nreasonable precision.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy.

Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach\ndemonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,\nincluding e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset\nwith audio-based representation."}

We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch.

We\nvalidated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,\nwhere each component of the loss function is systematically removed and\nevaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss\nsignificantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance\nof the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual\nnetwork-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT\nsolutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity\ncompared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied\nF-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by\nthe proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for\nvarious OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,\ndespite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting\nthe initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm."}

In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive.

Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as\ndemonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)\nand Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even\nenhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

Two popular\nLLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google\nGemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600\nresponses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate\nstereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'\npronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in\nAI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in\nthe workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.\nUnderstanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and\nassuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather\ncontribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include\nexpanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt\nengineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base."}

These resources,\nunlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification\ntechniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising\nmethod for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is\nchallenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces\na Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the\ncontinuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise\nwith data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium\nextraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's\nability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's\ntolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a\nfew hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the\nexploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,\npotentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes.

Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation.
