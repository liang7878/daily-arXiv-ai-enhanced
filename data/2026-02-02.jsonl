Shelling's theory explains how, in these settings, humans coordinate by relying on focal points: solutions or outcomes that naturally arise because they stand out in some way as salient or prominent to all players. This work studies Large Language Models (LLMs) as players in tacit coordination games, and addresses how, when, and why focal points emerge. We compare and quantify the coordination capabilities of LLMs in cooperative and competitive games for which human experiments are available. We also introduce several learning-free strategies to improve the coordination of LLMs, with themselves and with humans. On a selection of heterogeneous open-source models, including Llama, Qwen, and GPT-oss, we discover that LLMs have a remarkable capability to coordinate and often outperform humans, yet fail on common-sense coordination that involves numbers or nuanced cultural archetypes. This paper constitutes the first large-scale assessment of LLMs' tacit coordination within the theoretical and psychological framework of focal points."}

We introduce FairFormer, an amortized, permutation-equivariant two-tower transformer that encodes items and agents as unordered token sets, applies self-attention within each set, and uses item-to-agent cross-attention to produce per-item assignment distributions in a single forward pass. FairFormer is trained end-to-end to maximize expected log-Nash welfare on sampled instances, requiring no solver supervision, unrolled allocation procedures, or fairness labels. At test time, we discretize by row-wise $\\arg\\max$ and apply a lightweight post-processing routine that transfers items to eliminate violations of envy-freeness up to one item while prioritizing improvements in Nash welfare. Our approach generalizes beyond its training regime and achieves near-optimal welfare (e.g., for uniformly sampled valuations, $96$--$97\\%$ for Nash welfare; $95$--$96\\%$ for utilitarian welfare), outperforming strong baselines in solution quality and/or runtime."}

While dynamic and adaptive strategies have been extensively studied in the classical pooled testing literature, where the goal is to minimize the number of tests required for full diagnosis of a given population, much of the existing work on welfare-maximizing pooled testing adopts static formulations in which all tests are assigned in advance. In this paper, we study dynamic welfare-maximizing pooled testing strategies in which a limited number of tests are performed sequentially to maximize social welfare, defined as the aggregate utility of individuals who are confirmed to be healthy. We formally define the dynamic problem and study algorithmic approaches for sequential test assignment. Because exact dynamic optimization is computationally infeasible beyond small instances, we evaluate a range of strategies (including exact optimization baselines, greedy heuristics, mixed-integer programming relaxations, and learning-based policies) and empirically characterize their performance and tradeoffs using synthetic experiments. Our results show that dynamic testing can yield substantial welfare improvements over static baselines in low-budget regimes. We find that much of the benefit of dynamic testing is captured by simple greedy policies, which substantially outperform static approaches while remaining computationally efficient. Learning-based methods are included as flexible baselines, but in our experiments they do not reliably improve upon these heuristics. Overall, this work provides a principled computational perspective on dynamic pooled testing and clarifies when dynamic assignment meaningfully improves welfare in public health screening."}

Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning", "categories": ["cs.DB"], "comment": null, "summary": "For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals. Action Learning belongs to the French policy that aims to improve the volume and the quality of the contracts between Universities and companies."}

For both cases, we provide structural insights and near-optimal profit-maximizing mechanisms.

Yu"], "title": "Discovering High-utility Sequential Rules with Increasing Utility Ratio", "categories": ["cs.DB"], "comment": "IEEE Transactions on Big Data", "summary": "Utility-driven mining is an essential task in data science, as it can provide deeper insight into the real world. High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results."}

A mesh refinement study confirms the second-order convergence for the spatial discretizations error. Based on simulated input-output pairs and corresponding parameterizations for the diffusion, advection, and reaction mechanisms, we train a parameter-conditioned U-Net surrogate to approximate the fixed-horizon solution map. The surrogate incorporates Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) for parameter conditioning, coordinate encoding to incorporate spatial location information, and residual blocks to enable multiscale representation learning in combination with the U-Nets skip connections. The trained model achieves low prediction error on held-out test data and provides favorable prediction times due to the GPU based parallelization. Generalization is analyzed using a factorial test dataset, separating initial conditions from parameter conditioning. The results reveal that approximation difficulty varies primarily with the conditioning vector (i.e., the induced PDE regime), rather than with the initial conditions."}

Yet enforcing DP is computationally challenging: prior work typically formulates DP as a Linear Programming (LP) problem and relies on costly solvers, rendering them impractical for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a DP-aware objective while maintaining an approximately monotonic submodular structure, enabling efficient optimization with theoretical guarantees. We integrate this objective with blocking effectiveness through a tunable scalarization, yielding a principled fairness-effectiveness trade-offs. Building on this structure, we develop CELF-R, an accelerated seed selection algorithm that exploits approximate submodularity to eliminate redundant evaluations and naturally supports Pareto front construction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CELF-R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a $(1-1/e-ψ)$-approximate solution while maintaining high efficiency."}

Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines."}

We benchmark three geometric parameterizations, each combined with three representative BBO algorithms: differential evolution, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and heteroscedastic evolutionary Bayesian optimization, across 10D, 20D, and 50D design spaces.\n  Results reveal that parameterization quality has a stronger influence on optimization performance than optimizer choice: a well-structured parameterization enables robust and competitive performance across algorithms, whereas weaker representations increase optimizer dependency.

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths.

Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$.

However, the fidelity of reconstruction relies on the assumption that the time-delay map is an embedding, which is implicitly justified by Takens' embedding theorem but rarely scrutinised in practice. In this work, we argue that time-delay reconstruction is not always an embedding, and that the non-injectivity of the time-delay map induced by a given measurement function causes irreducible information loss, degrading downstream model performance. Our analysis reveals that this local self-overlap stems from inherent dynamical properties, governed by the competition between the dynamical and the curvature penalty, and the irreducible information loss scales with the product of the geometric separation and the probability mass. We establish a measure-theoretic framework that lifts the dynamics to the space of probability measures, where the multi-valued evolution induced by the non-injectivity is quantified by how far the $n$-step conditional kernel $K^{n}(x, \\cdot)$ deviates from a Dirac mass and introduce intrinsic stochasticity $\\mathcal{E}^{*}_{n}$, an almost-everywhere, data-driven certificate of deterministic closure, to quantify irreducible information loss without any prior information. We demonstrate that $\\mathcal{E}^{*}_{n}$ improves reconstruction quality and downstream model performance on both synthetic and real-world nonlinear data sets."}

Given the size and complexity of most communication networks, each entity typically only has a local view and thus must rely on a local routing protocol for sending and forwarding packets. A common solution for this is greedy routing, where packets are locally forwarded to a neighbor in the network that is closer to the packet's destination.\n  In this paper we investigate a game-theoretic model with autonomous agents that aim at forming a network where greedy routing is enabled. The agents are positioned in a metric space and each agent tries to establish as few links as possible, while maintaining that it can reach every other agent via greedy routing. Thus, this model captures how greedy routing networks are formed without any assumption on the distribution of the agents or the specific employed greedy routing protocol. Hence, it distills the essence that makes greedy routing work.\n  We study two variants of the model: with directed edges or with undirected edges. For the former, we show that equilibria exist, have optimal total cost, and that in Euclidean metrics they can be found efficiently. However, even for this simple setting computing optimal strategies is NP-hard. For the much more challenging setting with undirected edges, we show for the realistic setting with agents in 2D Euclidean space that the price of anarchy is between 1.75 and 1.8 and for higher dimensions it is less than 2. Also, we show that best response dynamics may cycle, but that in Euclidean space almost optimal approximate equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, for 2D Euclidean space, these approximate equilibria outperform the well-known Delaunay triangulation."}

The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items. Finally, the proposed RSC method was evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches."}

This growth couples scheduling decisions with feasibility: a scheduler must minimize latency under a hard memory budget, yet the response lengths of requests are inherently unknown. While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.\n  In this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000.

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec). First, it estimates the reliability of cached semantics under the user's latest interactions. Second, an on-device semantic calibration module is proposed to adjusts the cached semantic embedding on-device using up-to-date interaction evidence, without per-request cloud LLM involvement. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SCaLRec consistently improves recommendation performance over strong baselines under cloud semantic staleness."}

This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary.

Moreover, prevailing notions of MPMOP optimal solutions are restricted to strictly common Pareto optimal solutions, representing a narrow form of cooperation in multiparty decision making scenarios. These limitations obscure whether a solution set reflects balanced relative gains or meaningful consensus among heterogeneous DMs. To address these issues, this paper develops a fairness-aware performance evaluation framework grounded in a generalized notion of consensus solutions. From a cooperative game-theoretic perspective, we formalize four axioms that a fairness-aware evaluation function for MPMOPs should satisfy. By introducing a concession rate vector to quantify acceptable compromises by individual DMs, we generalize the classical definition of MPMOP optimal solutions and embed classical performance metrics into a Nash-product-based evaluation framework, which is theoretically shown to satisfy all axioms. To support empirical validation, we further construct benchmark problems that extend existing MPMOP suites by incorporating consensus-deficient negotiation structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation framework is able to distinguish algorithmic performance in a manner consistent with consensus-aware fairness considerations. Specifically, algorithms converging toward strictly common solutions are assigned higher evaluation scores when such solutions exist, whereas in the absence of strictly common solutions, algorithms that effectively cover the commonly acceptable region are more favorably evaluated."}

We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone."}

However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.\n  We present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation.

In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of encoder based classifiers (BERT, SciBERT, and PatentSBERTa) and open weight LLMs on a highly imbalanced benchmark dataset (USPTO 70k).

We deploy trained agents for filter bubble auditing and evaluate bubble breadth via content diversity and bubble depth via escape potential. The evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in fidelity over generic LLM baselines, enabling realistic behavior reproduction. Results reveal significant content narrowing over interaction. However, we find that Bilibili demonstrates the strongest escape potential. We release the first open multimodal short-video dataset and code to support reproducible auditing of recommender systems."}

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning."}

These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures."}

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic. We then present query algorithms that utilize COL-Trees to efficiently answer AkNN, kFN, and other queries. In our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform existing approaches, achieving up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement.

This instability impedes effective learning of neural network parameters and limits the scalability of ranking models.

Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.\n  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems."}

Though promising, its design space, i.e., surrogate model pool and selection standard, is still manually decided by human expert, resulting in labor-intensive fine-tuning for novel tasks. In this paper, we propose a learning-based adaptive strategy (COBRA++) that enhances COBRA in two aspects: 1) An augmented surrogate pool to break the tie with RBF-like surrogate and hence enhances model diversity and approximation capability; 2) A reinforcement learning-based online model selection policy that empowers efficient and accurate optimization process. The model selection policy is trained to maximize overall performance of COBRA++ across a distribution of constrained optimization problems with diverse properties. We have conducted multi-dimensional validation experiments and demonstrate that COBRA++ achieves substantial performance improvement against vanilla COBRA and its adaptive variant.

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems."}

In particular, a transformation technique which leverages the Cressie-Read discrepancy criterion under moment restrictions is used for summarizing the learned statistics between the observation data and the simulation outputs, while preserving the statistical power of the inference. Here, such a transformation of data-to-learned summary statistics also allows the simulation outputs to be conditioned on the observation data, so that the inference task can be performed over certain sample sets of the observation data that are considered as an empirical relevance or believed to be particular importance. Moreover, the simulation-based inference framework discussed in this paper can be extended further, and thus handling weakly dependent observation data. Finally, we remark that such an inference framework is suitable for implementation in distributed computing, i.e., computational tasks involving both the data-to-learned summary statistics and the Bayesian inferencing problem can be posed as a unified distributed inference problem that will exploit distributed optimization and MCMC algorithms for supporting large datasets associated with complex simulation models."}

Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost.

While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution."}

However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting.

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models. Despite its additional validation steps, EFParser maintains high computational efficiency, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world log analysis deployment."}

A line of recent work has studied samplers for discrete diffusion models, such as tau-leaping and Euler solver. However, these samplers require a large number of iterations to control discretization error, since the transition rates are frozen in time and evaluated at the initial state within each time interval. Moreover, theoretical results for these samplers often require boundedness conditions of the transition rate or they focus on a specific type of source distributions. To address those limitations, we establish non-asymptotic discretization error bounds for those samplers without any restriction on transition rates and source distributions, under the framework of discrete flow models. Furthermore, by analyzing a one-step lower bound of the Euler sampler, we propose two corrected samplers: \\textit{time-corrected sampler} and \\textit{location-corrected sampler}, which can reduce the discretization error of tau-leaping and Euler solver with almost no additional computational cost. We rigorously show that the location-corrected sampler has a lower iteration complexity than existing parallel samplers. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improved generation quality and reduced inference time on both simulation and text-to-image generation tasks.

We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality."}

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel. As a result, an external arbiter is required to arbitrate an immutable happens-before relation between concurrent events. Arbitration occurs asynchronously in batches via optional ''epoch events'', preserving availability. This introduces a bounded total order within epochs, and the resulting ''finality'' improves on the level of consistency CRDTs can provide."}

However, the geometric structure of the LPM is inherently symmetric, in the sense that outgoing and incoming edges are assumed to follow the same statistical distribution. As a consequence, the canonical LPM framework is not ideal for the analysis of directed networks. In addition, edges may be weighted to describe the duration or intensity of a connection. This can lead to disassortative patterns and other motifs that cannot be easily captured by the underlying geometry. To address these limitations, we develop a novel extension of the LPM, called the Mixed Latent Position Cluster Model (MLPCM), which can deal with asymmetry and non-Euclidean patterns, while providing new interpretations of the latent space. We dissect the directed edges of the network by formally disentangling how a node behaves from how it is perceived by others. This leads to a dual representation of a node's profile, identifying its ``overt'' and ``covert'' social positions. In order to efficiently estimate the parameters of our model, we develop a variational Bayes approach to approximate the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing variational frameworks, our algorithm does not require any additional numerical approximations. Model selection is performed by introducing a novel partially integrated complete likelihood criteria, which builds upon the literature on penalized likelihood methods. We demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed methodology using synthetic datasets, and we illustrate its practical utility with an application to a dataset of international arms transfers."}

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens."}

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal. These results provide a principled justification on when weak diffusion priors can be used reliably."}

This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability. This research highlights the intriguing potential of merging NLP with fuzzy decision-making methods in personnel selection, enabling scalable and unbiased solutions to recruitment difficulties."}

We then examine the basis-expansion approaches, including FlexCode (Izbicki and Lee, 2017) and DeepCDE (Dalmasso et al., 2020), which convert conditional density estimation into a set of nonparametric regression problems. In addition, we discuss two recent generative simulation-based methods that leverage modern deep generative architectures: the generative conditional distribution sampler (Zhou et al., 2023) and the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (Fu et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025). A systematic numerical comparison of these approaches is provided using a unified evaluation framework that ensures fairness and reproducibility. The performance metrics used for the estimated conditional distribution include the mean-squared errors of conditional mean and standard deviation, as well as the Wasserstein distance. We also discuss their flexibility and computational costs, highlighting the distinct advantages and limitations of each approach."}

In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution.

We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems.

However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting. We further prove that, under mild assumptions, the search process is complete: if a correct protocol exists, GGMS will eventually find it.

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.\n  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that VarParser achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly improving parsing efficiency while reducing the LLM invocation costs."}

Focusing on a spiked covariance setting where the dominant variance direction is orthogonal to the signal, we show that gradient descent (GD) suffers from a variance-induced misalignment: during the early escaping stage, the high-variance but uninformative spike direction is multiplicatively amplified, degrading alignment with the true signal under strong anisotropy. In contrast, spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) removes this spike amplification effect, leading to stable alignment and accelerated noise contraction. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and show that these phenomena persist under broader anisotropic covariances."}

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration."}

We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$.

It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. The result is a systematic, composable, and reusable approach to constructing and maintaining safety cases that are credible, auditable, and adaptive to the evolving behaviour of generative and frontier AI systems."}

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings."}

For a resolution parameter $K$, we map the mismatch between two univariate distributions $μ$ and $ν$ to a rank histogram on $\\{ 0, \\ldots, K\\}$ and measure its deviation from uniformity via a discrete $f$-divergence, yielding a rank-statistic divergence estimator. We prove that the resulting estimator of the divergence is monotone in $K$, is always a lower bound of the true $f$-divergence, and we establish quantitative convergence rates for $K\\to\\infty$ under mild regularity of the quantile-domain density ratio. To handle high-dimensional data, we define the sliced rank-statistic $f$-divergence by averaging the univariate construction over random projections, and we provide convergence results for the sliced limit as well. We also derive finite-sample deviation bounds along with asymptotic normality results for the estimator. Finally, we empirically validate the approach by benchmarking against neural baselines and illustrating its use as a learning objective in generative modelling experiments."}

To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy."}

To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy."}

We study this setting as Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL), where (i) clients are heterogeneous, (ii) tasks arrive sequentially with shifting domains, yet (iii) the label space remains fixed. Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of SPECIAL."}

In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.

By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer.

The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production."}

To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics.

Our method constructs a variational posterior by leveraging an auxiliary linear-Gaussian process. This auxiliary process yields a closed-form backward filter that serves as a ``guide'', steering the generative path toward high-likelihood regions. We then learn a neural residual--parameterized as a normalizing flow or a controlled SDE--to capture the non-linear discrepancies. This formulation allows for an unbiased path-wise subsampling scheme, reducing the training complexity from tree-size dependent to path-length dependent.

We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting. CraEG is training-free, single-pass, and compatible with standard sampling strategies.

Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it.

To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling.

Effective model training requires not only large quantities of sensor data but also balanced coverage that includes rare yet safety-critical scenarios.

This paper introduces the Lambda framework, an edge-native platform that enables on-vehicle data filtering and processing through user-defined functions. The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments. Results show competitive performance, reduced latency and jitter, and confirm that lambda-based abstractions can support real-time data processing in embedded autonomous driving systems.

We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions.

We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult. Therefore, we introduce a new online variant, computed from normalized advantage and subjective uncertainty. Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms random and classic AL baselines, achieving full-dataset performance while training on only 30% of the data, effectively reducing the cost of RLVR for reasoning tasks."}

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks. Overall, our study demonstrates that LLM-based agents are a powerful but non-uniform solution for SAST FP filtering, and that their practical deployment requires careful consideration of agent design, backbone model choice, vulnerability category, and operational cost."}

We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity.

To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone."}

We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements.

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately."}

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.\n  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.\n  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.\n  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines.

Existing VR testing approaches enable scene navigation and interaction activation, but lack the ability to automatically synthesise realistic 3D user inputs (e.g, grab and trigger actions via hand-held controllers). Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects. In addition, the Interaction Flow Graph can reveal potential interaction design smells that may compromise intended functionality and hinder testing performance for VR applications."}

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity.

At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments."}

This work presents a unified comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art microservice decomposition approaches spanning static, dynamic, and hybrid techniques. Using a consistent metric computation pipeline, we assess the decomposition quality across widely used benchmark systems (JPetStore, AcmeAir, DayTrader, and Plants) using Structural Modularity (SM), Interface Number(IFN), Inter-partition Communication (ICP), Non-Extreme Distribution (NED), and related indicators. Our analysis combines results reported in prior studies with experimentally reproduced outputs from available replication packages.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation."}

As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(ε,δ)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(nε)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping."}

To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias. Furthermore, a Dynamic Uncertainty Reward Adjustment mechanism is introduced to calibrate uncertainty weights in real-time according to model evolution and instance difficulty. Experimental results in mathematical reasoning and general tasks demonstrate that UCPO effectively resolves the reward imbalance, significantly improving the reliability and calibration of the model beyond their knowledge boundaries."}

Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status.

We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback."}

We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal.

Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence. Experiments on WebShop, HumanEval, and the Game of 24 demonstrate that TALC achieves superior task success rates and improved search efficiency compared to strong baselines, validating the benefits of specialization-aware routing and adaptive planning."}

Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval."}

This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process.

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution."}

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality."}

However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%."}

To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards.

We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound.

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes."}

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected."}

The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice. Future endeavors will concentrate on augmenting the dataset, enhancing model interpretability, and verifying the system in actual recruitment scenarios to better evaluate its practical applicability.

In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most."}

However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect a genuine understanding of vulnerability root causes or merely an exploitation of functional patterns. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed the \"semantic trap,\" where fine-tuned LLMs achieve high detection scores by associating certain functional domains with vulnerability likelihood rather than reasoning about the underlying security semantics.To systematically evaluate this phenomenon, we propose TrapEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to disentangle vulnerability root cause from functional pattern. TrapEval introduces two complementary datasets derived from real-world open-source projects: V2N, which pairs vulnerable code with unrelated benign code, and V2P, which pairs vulnerable code with its corresponding patched version, forcing models to distinguish near-identical code that differs only in subtle security-critical logic. Using TrapEval, we fine-tune five representative state-of-the-art LLMs across three model families and evaluate them under cross-dataset testing, semantic-preserving perturbations, and varying degrees of semantic gap measured by CodeBLEU.Our empirical results reveal that, despite improvements in metrics, fine-tuned LLMs consistently struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from its patched counterpart, exhibit severe robustness degradation under minor semantic-preserving transformations, and rely heavily on functional-context shortcuts when the semantic gap is small. These findings provide strong evidence that current fine-tuning practices often fail to impart true vulnerability reasoning. Our findings serve as a wake-up call: high benchmark scores on traditional datasets may be illusory, masking the model's inability to understand the true causal logic of vulnerabilities."}

We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints.

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training."}

To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation.

We propose a general framework based on Stratified Importance Sampling (SIS) that directly addresses these constraints in model monitoring. While SIS has previously been applied in specialized domains, our theoretical analysis establishes its broad applicability to the monitoring of classification models. Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains. Experiments across binary and multiclass tasks demonstrate consistent efficiency improvements under fixed label budgets, underscoring SIS as a principled, label-efficient, and operationally lightweight methodology for post-deployment model monitoring."}

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction. Our results show that treating molecules as continuous functions fundamentally changes how molecular representations generalize across tasks and yields downstream behavior that is stable to how molecules are discretized or queried."}

We propose G-PAC reasoning, a practical framework that provides PAC-style guarantees at the group level by partitioning the input space. We develop two instantiations: Group PAC (G-PAC) reasoning for known group structures and Clustered PAC (C-PAC) reasoning for unknown groupings. We prove that both G-PAC and C-PAC achieve group-conditional risk control, and that grouping can strictly improve efficiency over marginal PAC reasoning in heterogeneous settings.

Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels.

We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality."}

In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it.

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems."}

Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents. The code is available at https://github.com/yf-he/EvoClinician"}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations."}

Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training.

We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($dσ^2γ^{-2}\\log(Nd/δ)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems."}

This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents."}

We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench.

We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores."}

A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure).

We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction.

Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer).

In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoTraj in TIR."}

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal. This increases the relative importance of alignment research targeting reward hacking or goal misspecification."}

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge."}

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving. Finally, we find that fine-tuning with scenario data improves performance, whereas formulation-only training is ineffective. However, performance gaps are only partially alleviated, highlighting contextual mathematical reasoning as a central unsolved challenge for LLMs."}

We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times.

CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods."}

We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency. Notably, it achieves superior safety and comparable reasoning to GRPO, with significantly reduced computational cost.

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation. While local quality assessment remains an open question, our results demonstrate feasibility for real-time generation under typical game engine constraints."}

Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision."}

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions.

This paper investigates drunk language, i.e., text written under the influence of alcohol, as a driver for safety failures in large language models (LLMs). We investigate three mechanisms for inducing drunk language in LLMs: persona-based prompting, causal fine-tuning, and reinforcement-based post-training. When evaluated on 5 LLMs, we observe a higher susceptibility to jailbreaking on JailbreakBench (even in the presence of defences) and privacy leaks on ConfAIde, where both benchmarks are in English, as compared to the base LLMs as well as previously reported approaches. Via a robust combination of manual evaluation and LLM-based evaluators and analysis of error categories, our findings highlight a correspondence between human-intoxicated behaviour, and anthropomorphism in LLMs induced with drunk language. The simplicity and efficiency of our drunk language inducement approaches position them as potential counters for LLM safety tuning, highlighting significant risks to LLM safety."}

However, existing detection mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with rapid variant evolution and sophisticated obfuscation techniques that camouflage malicious intent. Furthermore, many current defenses suffer from high false-alarm rates when encountering benign administrative scripts that employ heavy obfuscation for intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we present ShellForge, an adversarial co-evolution framework that couples automated webshell generation with multi-view detection to continuously harden defensive boundaries. The framework operates through an iterative co-training loop where a generator and a detector mutually reinforce each other via the exchange of hard samples. The generator is optimized through supervised fine-tuning and preference-based reinforcement learning to synthesize functional, highly evasive variants. Simultaneously, we develop a multi-view fusion detector that integrates semantic features from long-string compression, structural features from pruned abstract syntax trees, and global statistical indicators such as Shannon entropy. To minimize false positives, ShellForge utilizes a LLM-based transformation to create de-malicious samples--scripts that retain complex obfuscation patterns but lack harmful payloads--serving as high-quality hard negatives during training. Evaluations on the public FWOID benchmark demonstrate that ShellForge significantly enhances defensive robustness. Upon convergence, the detector maintains a 0.981 F1-score while the generator achieves a 0.939 evasion rate against commercial engines on VirusTotal."}

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic. We then present query algorithms that utilize COL-Trees to efficiently answer AkNN, kFN, and other queries. In our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform existing approaches, achieving up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement.

We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning.

These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution. Extensive experiments show that TGPM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive link prediction, demonstrating exceptional cross-domain transferability."}

In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process.

First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys. Second, we propose an extension to NIST taxonomy by introducing additional categories of defenses. Third, by adopting NIST's established terminology and taxonomy as a foundation, we promote consistency and enable future researchers to build upon the standardized taxonomy proposed in this work. Finally, we provide a comprehensive catalog of the reviewed prompt injection defenses, documenting their reported quantitative effectiveness across specific LLMs and attack datasets, while also indicating which solutions are open-source and model-agnostic. This catalog, together with the guidelines presented herein, aims to serve as a practical resource for researchers advancing the field of adversarial machine learning and for developers seeking to implement effective defenses in production systems."}

Current approaches usually rely on training families of model variants or model distillation, which requires additional training and supports only a pre-selected set of sizes rather than fine-grained adaptation at runtime. In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio. We demonstrate that a single ES-SSM model trained once can be truncated to provide competitive performance compared with modern Transformer and SSM baselines at similar parameter scales. Furthermore, by testing under various runtime budgets, we observe smooth and stable budget-performance curves over a wide range of truncation levels."}

Watermarking is a promising approach, but existing methods either provide only binary signals or distort the sampling distribution, degrading text quality; distortion-free approaches, in turn, often suffer from weak detectability or robustness. We propose MirrorMark, a multi-bit and distortion-free watermark for LLMs. By mirroring sampling randomness in a measure-preserving manner, MirrorMark embeds multi-bit messages without altering the token probability distribution, preserving text quality by design. To improve robustness, we introduce a context-based scheduler that balances token assignments across message positions while remaining resilient to insertions and deletions. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the equal error rate to interpret empirical performance. Experiments show that MirrorMark matches the text quality of non-watermarked generation while achieving substantially stronger detectability: with 54 bits embedded in 300 tokens, it improves bit accuracy by 8-12% and correctly identifies up to 11% more watermarked texts at 1% false positive rate."}

Submitted to ICML. 8 pages, 5 figures (+ appendix)", "summary": "Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift."}

It scrutinizes the pervasive narratives that are shaping the societal engagement with AI, spotlighting key themes such as agency and decision-making, autonomy, truthfulness, knowledge processing, prediction, general purpose, neutrality and objectivity, apolitical optimization, sustainability game-changer, democratization, mass unemployment, and the dualistic portrayal of AI as either a harbinger of societal utopia or dystopia. Those narratives are analysed critically based on insights from critical computer science, critical data and algorithm studies, from STS, data protection theory, as well as from the philosophy of mind and semiotics. To properly analyse the narratives presented, the article first delves into a historical and technical contextualisation of the AI discourse itself. The article then introduces the notion of \"Zeitgeist AI\" to critique the imprecise and misleading application of the term \"AI\" across various societal sectors. Then, by discussing common narratives with nuance, the article contextualises and challenges often assumed socio-political implications of AI, uncovering in detail and with examples the inherent political, power infused and value-laden decisions within all AI applications. Concluding with a call for a more grounded engagement with AI, the article carves out acute problems ignored by the narratives discussed and proposes new narratives recognizing AI as a human-directed tool necessarily subject to societal governance."}

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation."}

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases. Evaluation on 2,458 job failures from TELUS demonstrates that FlaXifyer and LogSift enable effective automated triage, accelerate failure diagnosis, and pave the way towards the automated resolution of intermittent job failures."}

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers."}

Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices.

It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity."}

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment."}

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection."}

ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form.

While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data.

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions. Each Bayesian update reduces to solving a symmetric positive definite linear system, enabling coupled node and edge updates within a single fusion step. We construct sample-agnostic sparse precisions from a representation-induced dependency graph, thereby avoiding label leakage while enforcing node-edge consistency. On synthetic and molecular graph datasets, VBFN improves fidelity and diversity, and surpasses baseline methods."}

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable.

This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort."}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations."}

As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training."}

In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples).

We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05. Our results reveal that recoverability is not an artifact of model scale or architecture, but a governed property of interaction dynamics, providing a theoretical foundation for execution-level robustness in language agents."}

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families.

In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments.

Language models can also adapt to diverse tasks and learn new structure in context, and recent work has shown that this in-context learning (ICL) can be reflected in representational changes. Here we bring these two lines of research together to explore whether representation straightening occurs \\emph{within} a context during ICL. We measure representational straightening in Gemma 2 models across a diverse set of in-context tasks, and uncover a dichotomy in how LLMs' representations change in context. In continual prediction settings (e.g., natural language, grid world traversal tasks) we observe that increasing context increases the straightness of neural sequence trajectories, which is correlated with improvement in model prediction. Conversely, in structured prediction settings (e.g., few-shot tasks), straightening is inconsistent -- it is only present in phases of the task with explicit structure (e.g., repeating a template), but vanishes elsewhere. These results suggest that ICL is not a monolithic process. Instead, we propose that LLMs function like a Swiss Army knife: depending on task structure, the LLM dynamically selects between strategies, only some of which yield representational straightening."}

This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments."}

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods."}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead.

MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data.

However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

While dynamic and adaptive strategies have been extensively studied in the classical pooled testing literature, where the goal is to minimize the number of tests required for full diagnosis of a given population, much of the existing work on welfare-maximizing pooled testing adopts static formulations in which all tests are assigned in advance. In this paper, we study dynamic welfare-maximizing pooled testing strategies in which a limited number of tests are performed sequentially to maximize social welfare, defined as the aggregate utility of individuals who are confirmed to be healthy. We formally define the dynamic problem and study algorithmic approaches for sequential test assignment. Because exact dynamic optimization is computationally infeasible beyond small instances, we evaluate a range of strategies (including exact optimization baselines, greedy heuristics, mixed-integer programming relaxations, and learning-based policies) and empirically characterize their performance and tradeoffs using synthetic experiments. Our results show that dynamic testing can yield substantial welfare improvements over static baselines in low-budget regimes. We find that much of the benefit of dynamic testing is captured by simple greedy policies, which substantially outperform static approaches while remaining computationally efficient. Learning-based methods are included as flexible baselines, but in our experiments they do not reliably improve upon these heuristics. Overall, this work provides a principled computational perspective on dynamic pooled testing and clarifies when dynamic assignment meaningfully improves welfare in public health screening."}

This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\\% of samples of target equipment are used.

A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining."}

In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform.

We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking.

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves."}

This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases. We demonstrate the impact of our approach exemplarily on the PTB-XL ECG-dataset. This is a first step to enable fit-for-purpose evaluation of training and test data in practice as the base for establishing trustworthy AI in medicine."}

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency."}

Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy."}

With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld."}

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs."}

Using a mixed-methods approach with pre- and post-intervention surveys (N=205 pre; N=163 post), we analyse changes in students' ability to identify AI in everyday tools, their understanding of AI ethics, training, and safety, and their interest in STEM-related careers.\n  Baseline data revealed notable synthetic media risks: 82.4% of students reported having seen deepfakes, 18.5% reported sharing them, and 7.3% reported creating them.\n  Results show higher self-reported AI knowledge and confidence after the intervention, alongside improved recognition of AI in widely used platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok. This pattern suggests a shift from seeing these tools as merely \"algorithm-based\" to recognising them as AI-driven systems. Students also reported increased interest in STEM careers post-workshop; however, effect sizes were small, indicating that sustained approaches beyond one-off workshops may be needed to influence longer-term aspirations. Overall, the findings support scalable AI literacy programs that pair foundational AI concepts with an explicit emphasis on synthetic media safety."}

In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling. Together, our results identify local intrinsic dimension as a unifying descriptor of representational convergence in artificial and biological systems."}

Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations. Our experimental results a popular benchmark demonstrate that our actor-derived representations consistently outperform representations learned via value estimation."}

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification."}

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment."}

By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user. Evaluations on 12 generative and classification benchmarks show that OSNIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, sharply reducing attack success rates while maintaining strong model utility under strict security constraints."}

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models."}

We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance. Experiments across architectures and datasets validate the theory and demonstrate the utility of embedding-based diagnostics."}

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort."}

Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency. Furthermore, we release our benchmark as an open-source resource for the community to foster future research in autonomous systems.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $α$-entmax attention with $α= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms."}

We name this phenomenon the Holographic Characteristic of language models. For the purpose of exploring this characteristic and further improving the inference efficiency of language models, we propose a plugin called HOLO, which leverages the Holographic Characteristic to extract target-side keywords from language models within a limited number of generation steps and complements the sentence with a parallel lexically constrained text generation method. To verify the effectiveness of HOLO, we conduct massive experiments on language models of varying architectures and scales in the short-text generation scenario. The results demonstrate that HOLO achieves comparable performance to the baselines in terms of both automatic and human-like evaluation metrics and highlight the potential of the Holographic Characteristic."}

We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate that EntQuant does not only achieve state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation sets and models, but also retains functional performance on more complex benchmarks with instruction-tuned models, all at modest inference overhead."}

However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects."}

We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions."}

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model."}

We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features.

While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets.

In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance.

Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin. The source code of MIFOMO is open-sourced in https://github.com/Naeem- Paeedeh/MIFOMO for reproducibility and convenient further study."}

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators. The merged LoRAs retain less weights and incur no inference latency, making our method computationally lightweight."}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models.

We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation."}

Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines."}

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure.

Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency."}

To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of \"memory-dense\" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets."}

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning."}

The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap.

To address these problems, we propose Scalable Topology-Preserving Graph Coarsening (STPGC) by introducing the concepts of graph strong collapse and graph edge collapse extended from algebraic topology.

A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining."}

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected."}

By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling."}

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task."}

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor."}

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding."}

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios.

These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection. Experiments on D4RL and NeoRL2 demonstrate robust gains across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance overall."}

Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization.

We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs."}

We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions.

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT."}

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action. This can guide practitioners to collect more variables or lean towards a randomized study for best action identification."}

Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since naïve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics"}

We study discretized categorical actors that represent each action dimension with a distribution over bins, yielding a policy objective that resembles a cross-entropy loss.

We introduce a Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective (CATTO), a calibration-aware objective that aligns predicted confidence with empirical prediction correctness, which can be combined with the original preference optimization objectives. Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline.

In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning."}

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DCR, reducing average prediction set size by up to 36%, while maintaining valid coverage."}

We draw on relational ethics and, in particular, African communitarian philosophies, to foreground the nuances of inclusive, participatory processes and long-term relationships with communities. Involving communities throughout the AI lifecycle can foster meaningful relationships with AI design and development teams that incrementally build trust and promote more equitable and context-sensitive AI systems.

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice."}

While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions."}

Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains. Together, these results provide a principled account of when std normalization helps in GRPO, and offer broader insights into the design of critic-free RL algorithms."}

We then discuss detection. We argue that detecting fine-tuning-based steganographic attacks requires approaches beyond traditional steganalysis. Standard approaches measure distributional shift, which is an expected side-effect of fine-tuning. Instead, we propose a mechanistic interpretability approach: linear probes trained on later-layer activations detect the secret with up to 33\\% higher accuracy in fine-tuned models compared to base models, even for low-recoverability schemes.

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001). Additionally, STGAT reduces detection delay by 26%, achieving a 2.3-time-step delay while maintaining stable performance under overflow, drift, and physical inconsistencies."}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients."}

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated.

By learning extrusion sequences that assemble a mesh, similar to the way artists create meshes, our approach naturally supports arbitrary output face counts and produces manifold meshes by design, in contrast to recent transformer-based models. The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions. We demonstrate that our representation enables reconstruction, novel shape synthesis, and the addition of new features to existing meshes."}

Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning.

We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks."}

This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations."}

However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.\n  Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.\n  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies."}

The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively."}

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of \"memory-dense\" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets."}

To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM. Notably, our Riemannian Flow Matching-based DiT exhibits efficient convergence, achieving a gFID of 3.47 at 80 epochs."}

However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities. The model was optimised with various training samples to achieve the best predictive performance and gain insights into the relationship between pollutants and traffic. The workflow we have designed is straightforward and adaptable to other contexts, like other cities beyond the specifics of our dataset."}

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and corroborate the theoretical insights."}

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines.

To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns. We further construct an interactive trajectory understanding dataset from closed-loop simulation to support multi-turn training. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our multi-turn reasoning paradigm.

In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task."}

Traditional RGB surveillance raises significant concerns regarding visual recording and storage, while existing privacy-preserving methods-ranging from physical desensitization to traditional cryptographic or obfuscation techniques-often compromise semantic understanding capabilities or fail to guarantee mathematical irreversibility against reconstruction attacks. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel privacy-preserving perception technology based on the AI Flow theoretical framework and an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. The proposed methodology integrates source desensitization with irreversible feature mapping. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, the edge device performs millisecond-level processing to transform raw imagery into abstract feature vectors via non-linear mapping and stochastic noise injection. This process constructs a unidirectional information flow that strips identity-sensitive attributes, rendering the reconstruction of original images impossible. Subsequently, the cloud platform utilizes multimodal family models to perform joint inference solely on these abstract vectors to detect abnormal behaviors. This approach fundamentally severs the path to privacy leakage at the architectural level, achieving a breakthrough from video surveillance to de-identified behavior perception and offering a robust solution for risk management in high-sensitivity public spaces."}

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected."}

We demonstrate that recycling computation from the discarded tokens is beneficial, as these tokens retain contextual information useful for subsequent decoding iterations. In light of this, we propose Residual Context Diffusion (RCD), a module that converts these discarded token representations into contextual residuals and injects them back for the next denoising step. RCD uses a decoupled two-stage training pipeline to bypass the memory bottlenecks associated with backpropagation. We validate our method on both long CoT reasoning (SDAR) and short CoT instruction following (LLaDA) models. We demonstrate that a standard dLLM can be efficiently converted to the RCD paradigm with merely ~1 billion tokens. RCD consistently improves frontier dLLMs by 5-10 points in accuracy with minimal extra computation overhead across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, on the most challenging AIME tasks, RCD nearly doubles baseline accuracy and attains up to 4-5x fewer denoising steps at equivalent accuracy levels."}

In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor."}

Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus.

In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

As both offensive and defensive prompt injection techniques evolve quickly, a structured understanding of mitigation strategies becomes increasingly important. To address that, this work presents the first systematic literature review on prompt injection mitigation strategies, comprehending 88 studies. Building upon NIST's report on adversarial machine learning, this work contributes to the field through several avenues. First, it identifies studies beyond those documented in NIST's report and other academic reviews and surveys.

However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them.

Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide.

We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective.

Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions."}

Existing audio large language model (LLM)-based methods excel in content understanding; however, their predictions are often biased toward semantically correlated cues, which results in fine-grained acoustic artifacts being overlooked during the decisionmaking process. Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading. Further analysis reveals that these improvements stem from a coordinated utilization of semantic and acoustic information, as opposed to simple modality aggregation."}

Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models.

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments."}

Prior explanations mainly attribute this phenomenon to the generalization of erroneous or unsafe content. In this work, we show that this view is incomplete. Across multiple domains and model families, we find that fine-tuning models on data exhibiting specific character-level dispositions induces substantially stronger and more transferable misalignment than incorrect-advice fine-tuning, while largely preserving general capabilities. This indicates that emergent misalignment arises from stable shifts in model behavior rather than from capability degradation or corrupted knowledge. We further show that such behavioral dispositions can be conditionally activated by both training-time triggers and inference-time persona-aligned prompts, revealing shared structure across emergent misalignment, backdoor activation, and jailbreak susceptibility. Overall, our results identify character formation as a central and underexplored alignment risk, suggesting that robust alignment must address behavioral dispositions rather than isolated errors or prompt-level defenses."}

This challenge is especially acute in mixed-motive multi-agent systems. This work focuses on cooperative resilience, the ability of agents to anticipate, resist, recover, and transform in the face of disruptions, a critical yet underexplored property in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. We study how reward function design influences resilience in mixed-motive settings and introduce a novel framework that learns reward functions from ranked trajectories, guided by a cooperative resilience metric. Agents are trained in a suite of social dilemma environments using three reward strategies: i) traditional individual reward; ii) resilience-inferred reward; and iii) hybrid that balance both. We explore three reward parameterizations-linear models, hand-crafted features, and neural networks, and employ two preference-based learning algorithms to infer rewards from behavioral rankings. Our results demonstrate that hybrid strategy significantly improve robustness under disruptions without degrading task performance and reduce catastrophic outcomes like resource overuse. These findings underscore the importance of reward design in fostering resilient cooperation, and represent a step toward developing robust multi-agent systems capable of sustaining cooperation in uncertain environments."}

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens."}

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning. These results establish a clear distinction between reasoning and planning."}

We demonstrate that the locality required to maximize cache hit rates fundamentally conflicts with the cryptographic avalanche effect necessary for collision resistance. Our conceptual analysis formalizes this inherent trade-off between performance (locality) and security (collision resilience), revealing that semantic caching is naturally vulnerable to key collision attacks.\n  While prior research has focused on side-channel and privacy risks, we present the first systematic study of integrity risks arising from cache collisions. We introduce CacheAttack, an automated framework for launching black-box collision attacks. We evaluate CacheAttack in security-critical tasks and agentic workflows. It achieves a hit rate of 86\\% in LLM response hijacking and can induce malicious behaviors in LLM agent, while preserving strong transferability across different embedding models.

Ignoring such dependencies can yield miscalibrated posteriors and even confidently incorrect predictions. We study label aggregation through a hierarchy of dependence-aware models based on Ising graphical models and latent factors. For class-dependent Ising models, the Bayes log-odds is generally quadratic in votes; for class-independent couplings, it reduces to a linear weighted vote with correlation-adjusted parameters. We present finite-$K$ examples showing that methods based on conditional independence can flip the Bayes label despite matching per-annotator marginals. We prove separation results demonstrating that these methods remain strictly suboptimal as the number of judges grows, incurring nonvanishing excess risk under latent factors. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the classical baselines."}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled substantial progress in automated veracity assessment, including automated fact-checking and claim verification systems. Typical veracity assessment pipelines break down complex claims into sub-claims, retrieve external evidence, and then apply LLM reasoning to assess veracity. However, existing methods often treat evidence retrieval as a static, isolated step and do not effectively manage or reuse retrieved evidence across claims. In this work, we propose MERMAID, a memory-enhanced multi-agent veracity assessment framework that tightly couples the retrieval and reasoning processes. MERMAID integrates agent-driven search, structured knowledge representations, and a persistent memory module within a Reason-Action style iterative process, enabling dynamic evidence acquisition and cross-claim evidence reuse. By retaining retrieved evidence in an evidence memory, the framework reduces redundant searches and improves verification efficiency and consistency. We evaluate MERMAID on three fact-checking benchmarks and two claim-verification datasets using multiple LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families.

We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation. This work propels a paradigm shift in LTSF: moving from passive Static Mapping to autonomous Evolutionary Reasoning."}

A sequence of improvements through the 1980s culminated in a lower bound of $0.824$, with no substantial progress reported over the past three decades. Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on contest-level mathematical problems, yet their potential for addressing open, research-level questions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel AI system for obtaining tighter lower bounds on the Steiner ratio. Rather than directly prompting LLMs to solve the conjecture, we task them with generating rule-constrained geometric lemmas implemented as executable code. These lemmas are then used to construct a collection of specialized functions, which we call verification functions, that yield theoretically certified lower bounds of the Steiner ratio. Through progressive lemma refinement driven by reflection, the system establishes a new certified lower bound of 0.8559 for the Steiner ratio. The entire research effort involves only thousands of LLM calls, demonstrating the strong potential of LLM-based systems for advanced mathematical research."}

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice."}

We give the first fully amortized variational approximation to the tempered posterior family $p_β(θ\\mid x) \\propto π(θ)\\,p(x \\mid θ)^β$ by training a single $(x,β)$-conditioned neural posterior estimator $q_φ(θ\\mid x,β)$ that enables sampling in a single forward pass, without simulator calls or inference-time MCMC.

We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective."}

Existing discrete diffusion and flow-based methods rely on reversing fixed corruption processes or following prescribed probability paths, which can force generation through low-likelihood regions and require countless sampling steps. We introduce Minimal-action discrete Schrödinger Bridge Matching (MadSBM), a rate-based generative framework for peptide design that formulates generation as a controlled continuous-time Markov process on the amino-acid edit graph. To yield probability trajectories that remain near high-likelihood sequence neighborhoods throughout generation, MadSBM 1) defines generation relative to a biologically informed reference process derived from pre-trained protein language model logits and 2) learns a time-dependent control field that biases transition rates to produce low-action transport paths from a masked prior to the data distribution. We finally introduce guidance to the MadSBM sampling procedure towards a specific functional objective, expanding the design space of therapeutic peptides; to our knowledge, this represents the first-ever application of discrete classifier guidance to Schrödinger bridge-based generative models."}

We formalize this via an $\\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning.

As this typically involves processing sensitive personal information, releasing either the trained model or generated synthetic datasets can still pose privacy risks. Yet, recent research, commercial deployments, and privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) largely assess anonymity at the level of an individual dataset.\n  In this paper, we rethink anonymity claims about synthetic data from a model-centric perspective and argue that meaningful assessments must account for the capabilities and properties of the underlying generative model and be grounded in state-of-the-art privacy attacks. This perspective better reflects real-world products and deployments, where trained models are often readily accessible for interaction or querying. We interpret the GDPR's definitions of personal data and anonymization under such access assumptions to identify the types of identifiability risks that must be mitigated and map them to privacy attacks across different threat settings. We then argue that synthetic data techniques alone do not ensure sufficient anonymization. Finally, we compare the two mechanisms most commonly used alongside synthetic data -- Differential Privacy (DP) and Similarity-based Privacy Metrics (SBPMs) -- and argue that while DP can offer robust protections against identifiability risks, SBPMs lack adequate safeguards. Overall, our work connects regulatory notions of identifiability with model-centric privacy attacks, enabling more responsible and trustworthy regulatory assessment of synthetic data systems by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers."}

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations."}

DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs."}

In particular, a transformation technique which leverages the Cressie-Read discrepancy criterion under moment restrictions is used for summarizing the learned statistics between the observation data and the simulation outputs, while preserving the statistical power of the inference. Here, such a transformation of data-to-learned summary statistics also allows the simulation outputs to be conditioned on the observation data, so that the inference task can be performed over certain sample sets of the observation data that are considered as an empirical relevance or believed to be particular importance. Moreover, the simulation-based inference framework discussed in this paper can be extended further, and thus handling weakly dependent observation data. Finally, we remark that such an inference framework is suitable for implementation in distributed computing, i.e., computational tasks involving both the data-to-learned summary statistics and the Bayesian inferencing problem can be posed as a unified distributed inference problem that will exploit distributed optimization and MCMC algorithms for supporting large datasets associated with complex simulation models."}

We propose MonoScale, an expansion-aware update framework that proactively generates a small set of agent-conditioned familiarization tasks, harvests evidence from both successful and failed interactions, and distills it into auditable natural-language memory to guide future routing.

A line of recent work has studied samplers for discrete diffusion models, such as tau-leaping and Euler solver. However, these samplers require a large number of iterations to control discretization error, since the transition rates are frozen in time and evaluated at the initial state within each time interval. Moreover, theoretical results for these samplers often require boundedness conditions of the transition rate or they focus on a specific type of source distributions. To address those limitations, we establish non-asymptotic discretization error bounds for those samplers without any restriction on transition rates and source distributions, under the framework of discrete flow models. Furthermore, by analyzing a one-step lower bound of the Euler sampler, we propose two corrected samplers: \\textit{time-corrected sampler} and \\textit{location-corrected sampler}, which can reduce the discretization error of tau-leaping and Euler solver with almost no additional computational cost. We rigorously show that the location-corrected sampler has a lower iteration complexity than existing parallel samplers. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by demonstrating improved generation quality and reduced inference time on both simulation and text-to-image generation tasks.

Evolutionary Computation methods are generally advantaged in solving DOPs since they resemble dynamic biological evolution. However, existing evolutionary dynamic optimization methods rely heavily on human-crafted adaptive strategy to detect environment variation in DOPs, and then adapt the searching strategy accordingly. These hand-crafted strategies may perform ineffectively at out-of-box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-assisted approach to enable automated variation detection and self-adaption in evolutionary algorithms. This is achieved by borrowing the bi-level learning-to-optimize idea from recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization works. We use a deep Q-network as optimization dynamics detector and searching strategy adapter: It is fed as input with current-step optimization state and then dictates desired control parameters to underlying evolutionary algorithms for next-step optimization. The learning objective is to maximize the expected performance gain across a problem distribution. Once trained, our approach could generalize toward unseen DOPs with automated environment variation detection and self-adaption. To facilitate comprehensive validation, we further construct an easy-to-difficult DOPs testbed with diverse synthetic instances. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate flexible searching behavior and superior performance of our approach in solving DOPs, compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of \"easy\" versus \"hard\" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects."}

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

The attack leverages an advanced instruction-following text-to-speech (TTS) model to exploit structural and acoustic properties, thereby circumventing safety mechanisms primarily calibrated for text.

In this work, we propose SpanNorm, a novel technique designed to resolve this dilemma by integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Structurally, SpanNorm establishes a clean residual connection that spans the entire transformer block to stabilize signal propagation, while employing a PostNorm-style computation that normalizes the aggregated output to enhance model performance. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that SpanNorm, combined with a principled scaling strategy, maintains bounded signal variance throughout the network, preventing the gradient issues that plague PostNorm models, and also alleviating the representation collapse of PreNorm. Empirically, SpanNorm consistently outperforms standard normalization schemes in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and stable Transformer architectures."}

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation.

In this work, we investigate whether smaller models can serve as efficient evaluators by leveraging internal representations instead of surface generation. We uncover a consistent empirical pattern: small LMs, despite with weak generative ability, encode rich evaluative signals in their hidden states. This motivates us to propose the Semantic Capacity Asymmetry Hypothesis: evaluation requires significantly less semantic capacity than generation and can be grounded in intermediate representations, suggesting that evaluation does not necessarily need to rely on large-scale generative models but can instead leverage latent features from smaller ones. Our findings motivate a paradigm shift from LLM-as-a-Judge to Representation-as-a-Judge, a decoding-free evaluation strategy that probes internal model structure rather than relying on prompted output. We instantiate this paradigm through INSPECTOR, a probing-based framework that predicts aspect-level evaluation scores from small model representations. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, GPQA) show that INSPECTOR substantially outperforms prompting-based small LMs and closely approximates full LLM judges, while offering a more efficient, reliable, and interpretable alternative for scalable evaluation."}

We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control.

Focusing on a spiked covariance setting where the dominant variance direction is orthogonal to the signal, we show that gradient descent (GD) suffers from a variance-induced misalignment: during the early escaping stage, the high-variance but uninformative spike direction is multiplicatively amplified, degrading alignment with the true signal under strong anisotropy. In contrast, spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) removes this spike amplification effect, leading to stable alignment and accelerated noise contraction.

In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs."}

To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes."}

While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can generate correct and performant GPU kernels, kernel generation for neural processing units (NPUs) remains largely underexplored due to domain-specific programming models, limited public examples, and sparse documentation. Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution."}

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems."}

We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance.

Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

Fine-tuned models, by contrast, exhibit the opposite behavior, attaining a lower overall G-measure of 51% but substantially higher precision of 75% at the cost of reduced recall of 36%.

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step. This objective effectively mitigates the risk of incorrect pruning while incurring negligible computational overhead compared to standard SFT. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Code will be released upon acceptance."}

However, despite their ubiquitous use, the exact mechanisms underlying their outstanding performance remain unclear. Different methods for LLM explainability exist, and many are, as a method, not fully understood themselves. We started with the question of how linguistic abstraction emerges in LLMs, aiming to detect it across different LLM modules (attention heads and input embeddings). For this, we used methods well-established in the literature: (1) probing for token-level relational structures, and (2) feature-mapping using embeddings as carriers of human-interpretable properties.\n  Both attempts failed for different methodological reasons: Attention-based explanations collapsed once we tested the core assumption that later-layer representations still correspond to tokens. Property-inference methods applied to embeddings also failed because their high predictive scores were driven by methodological artifacts and dataset structure rather than meaningful semantic knowledge. These failures matter because both techniques are widely treated as evidence for what LLMs supposedly understand, yet our results show such conclusions are unwarranted. These limitations are particularly relevant in pervasive and distributed computing settings where LLMs are deployed as system components and interpretability methods are relied upon for debugging, compression, and explaining models."}

This observation suggests that enforcing strict positional supervision during training is misaligned with the irreversible denoising dynamics of MDLM decoding. Motivated by this mismatch, we adopt an alignment-flexible supervision strategy during fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce a special token <slack> via the connectionist temporal classification objective.

However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them.

Furthermore, by incorporating Sensitivity Analysis (fANOVA) and comparing different covariance kernels (e.g., Matérn vs. RBF), we provide physical interpretability to the black-box model, revealing the dominant hardware parameters driving system performance."}

We propose a Compressed Block-Convolutional (C-BC) measurement model based on a low-rank Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decomposition that is analytically initialized from a low-rank factorization of physics-derived forward/backward operators in time delay-based measurements. We use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) to select a compact set of basis filters from the analytic model and compute linear mixing coefficients to approximate the full model. We consider the Learned Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA) network as a representative example for which the C-BC-LISTA extension is presented. In simulated multichannel ultrasound imaging across multiple Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), C-BC-LISTA requires substantially fewer parameters and smaller model size than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while improving reconstruction accuracy. In ablations over OMP, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based, and random initializations, OMP-initialized structured compression performs best, yielding the most efficient training and the best performance."}

Deployed language models almost never follow it, instead being exposed through a single API endpoint that serves all users and requests. This gap exists not because least privilege would be unhelpful; deployments would benefit greatly from reducing unnecessary capability exposure. The real obstacle is definitional and mechanistic: what does \"access\" mean inside a language model, and how can we enforce it without retraining or deploying multiple models? We take inspiration from least privilege in computer systems and define a class of models called least-privilege language models, where privilege is reachable internal computation during the forward pass. In this view, lowering privilege literally shrinks the model's accessible function class, as opposed to denying access via learned policies. We formalize deployment-time control as a monitor-allocator-enforcer stack, separating (i) request-time signals, (ii) a decision rule that allocates privilege, and (iii) an inference-time mechanism that selects privilege. We then propose Nested Least-Privilege Networks, a shape-preserving, rank-indexed intervention that provides a smooth, reversible control knob. We show that this knob yields policy-usable privilege-utility frontiers and enables selective suppression of targeted capabilities with limited collateral degradation across various policies. Most importantly, we argue for a new deployment paradigm that challenges the premise that language models can only be controlled at the output level."}

However, these approaches typically utilize a diffusion prior trained at a single scale, ignoring the hierarchical scale structure of image data. In this work, we propose to decompose images into Laplacian pyramid scales and train separate diffusion priors for each frequency band. We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales. Evaluated on brain, knee, and prostate MRI data, our approach both improves perceptual quality over baselines and reduces inference time through smaller coarse-scale networks. Our framework unifies multiscale reconstruction and diffusion priors for medical image super-resolution."}

A defining feature of masked SSL is that training aggregates predictions across many masking patterns, giving rise to a joint, matrix-valued predictor rather than a single vector-valued estimator. This object encodes how coordinates condition on one another and poses new analytical challenges. We develop a precise high-dimensional analysis of masked modeling objectives in the proportional regime where the number of samples scales with the ambient dimension. Our results provide explicit expressions for the generalization error and characterize the spectral structure of the learned predictor, revealing how masked modeling extracts structure from data. For spiked covariance models, we show that the joint predictor undergoes a Baik--Ben Arous--Péché (BBP)-type phase transition, identifying when masked SSL begins to recover latent signals. Finally, we identify structured regimes in which masked self-supervised learning provably outperforms PCA, highlighting potential advantages of SSL objectives over classical unsupervised methods"}

Recent work casts training-free conditional generation in flow models as an optimal control problem; however, solving the resulting trajectory optimisation is computationally and memory intensive, requiring differentiation through the flow dynamics or adjoint solves. We propose MPC-Flow, a model predictive control framework that formulates inverse problem solving with flow-based generative models as a sequence of control sub-problems, enabling practical optimal control-based guidance at inference time. We provide theoretical guarantees linking MPC-Flow to the underlying optimal control objective and show how different algorithmic choices yield a spectrum of guidance algorithms, including regimes that avoid backpropagation through the generative model trajectory. We evaluate MPC-Flow on benchmark image restoration tasks, spanning linear and non-linear settings such as in-painting, deblurring, and super-resolution, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability to massive state-of-the-art architectures via training-free guidance of FLUX.2 (32B) in a quantised setting on consumer hardware."}

We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erdős--Rényi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks."}

Nested Sampling is a robust alternative to standard MCMC, yet its typically sequential structure and hard constraints make efficient accelerator implementations difficult. This paper introduces Nested Slice Sampling (NSS), a GPU-friendly, vectorized formulation of Nested Sampling that uses Hit-and-Run Slice Sampling for constrained updates. A tuning analysis yields a simple near-optimal rule for setting the slice width, improving high-dimensional behavior and making per-step compute more predictable for parallel execution. Experiments on challenging synthetic targets, high dimensional Bayesian inference, and Gaussian process hyperparameter marginalization show that NSS maintains accurate evidence estimates and high-quality posterior samples, and is particularly robust on difficult multimodal problems where current state-of-the-art methods such as tempered SMC baselines can struggle. An open-source implementation is released to facilitate adoption and reproducibility."}

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization."}

Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we average multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. We further introduce a real-world dataset across multi-bands acquired with two twin ground-based telescopes, providing paired raw frames and instrument-pipeline calibrated frames, together with calibration data and stacked high-SNR bases for real-world evaluation."}

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy."}

To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments."}
