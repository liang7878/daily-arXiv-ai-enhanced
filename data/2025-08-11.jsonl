A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.

The architecture\nimplements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active\nInference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through\nhierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring\nsafety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in\nnatural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy\nminimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.\nThe paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our\nframework's safety properties.

This growth makes load\nbalancing a key part of cloud systems, as it helps distribute user requests\nacross servers to maintain performance, prevent overload, and ensure a smooth\nuser experience. Despite its importance, managing server resources and keeping\nworkloads balanced over time remains a major challenge in cloud environments.\nThis paper introduces a novel Score-Based Dynamic Load Balancer (SBDLB) that\nallocates workloads to virtual machines based on real-time performance metrics.\nThe objective is to enhance resource utilization and overall system efficiency.\nThe method was thoroughly tested using the CloudSim 7G platform, comparing its\nperformance against the throttled load balancing strategy. Evaluations were\nconducted across a variety of workloads and scenarios, demonstrating the\nSBDLB's ability to adapt dynamically to workload fluctuations while optimizing\nresource usage. The proposed method outperformed the throttled strategy,\nimproving average response times by 34% and 37% in different scenarios. It also\nreduced data center processing times by an average of 13%.

Collaborative\nblock mining can further boost mining efficiency by allowing multiple miners to\nform coalitions, pooling their computing resources and transaction data\ntogether to mine new blocks collaboratively. Therefore, an MEC-assisted\ncollaborative blockchain network can leverage the strengths of both\ntechnologies, offering improved efficiency, security, and scalability for\nblockchain systems. While existing research in this area has mainly focused on\nthe single-coalition collaboration mode, where each miner can only join one\ncoalition, this work explores a more comprehensive multi-coalition\ncollaboration mode, which allows each miner to join multiple coalitions. To\nanalyze the behavior of miners and the edge computing service provider (ECP) in\nthis scenario, we propose a novel two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the\nECP, as the leader, determines the prices of computing resources for all MUs.\nIn Stage II, each MU decides the coalitions to join, resulting in an\noverlapping coalition formation (OCF) game; Subsequently, each coalition\ndecides how many edge computing resources to purchase from the ECP, leading to\nan edge resource competition (ERC) game. We derive the closed-form Nash\nequilibrium for the ERC game, based on which we further propose an OCF-based\nalternating algorithm to achieve a stable coalition structure for the OCF game\nand develop a near-optimal pricing strategy for the ECP's resource pricing\nproblem."}

This\nconceptual paper introduces Composer, PHP's standard dependency manager, and\ncategorizes a curated selection of Composer packages that significantly reduce\ndevelopment effort while fostering professional software practices. Grounded in\npractical and pedagogical considerations, the paper illustrates how educators\nand learners can strategically leverage these tools to build typical academic\nor personal Laravel-based systems. Central to this approach is maintaining code\nquality and reinforcing conceptual understanding. The paper also addresses\npotential risks such as package conflicts and over-reliance on tools, providing\nbest-practice recommendations to mitigate them. While the goal is to accelerate\ndevelopment, the deeper objective is to reinforce professional workflows and\nindustry readiness. Exposure to Composer packages enhances curriculum relevance\nand smooths the transition from academia to the workplace. However, effective\nintegration requires deliberate instructional design aligned with learning\nobjectives. Without guidance, students may treat packages as black boxes. Thus,\neducators must teach not only how to use these tools, but also when and why,\nencouraging critical evaluation of their utility and limitations. This ensures\nthat practical convenience supports rather than supplants deep learning."}

A key contribution is the application of the crossover operator,\nwhich facilitates exploration by searching across a broader space of potential\ntest inputs.

The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both\nhistorical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal\nif not higher overall collision risk guarantees."}

With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection.

However, most existing studies focus on either\nheterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of\nheterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their\nperformance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven\nreal-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of\nAHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations."}

This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more\nsophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more\nbroadly applicable.

As a\nresult, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as\ninteractions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack\nsufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming\nscenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk\nof forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts\n(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.\nXSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert\nnetworks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in\nresponse to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert\nand backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains\nmodel compactness.

Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral\nsequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are\nencoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies,\nwhile the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match\nthe encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused\nto construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a\nmultilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on\nthe CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score."}

Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets.

It is not a ``picture-in-the-head'' imagination. It is a faculty to\nmentally visualize coherent and holistic systems of concepts and causal links\nthat serve as semantic contexts for reasoning, decision making and prediction.\nOur position is that the role of cognitive imagination is still greatly\nunderestimated, and this creates numerous problems and diminishes the current\ncapabilities of AI. For instance, when reasoning, humans rely on imaginary\ncontexts to retrieve background info. They also constantly return to the\ncontext for semantic verification that their reasoning is still reasonable.\nThus, reasoning without imagination is blind. This paper is a call for greater\nattention to cognitive imagination as the next promising breakthrough in\nartificial intelligence. As an instrument for simulating cognitive imagination,\nwe propose semantic models -- a new approach to mathematical models that can\nlearn, like neural networks, and are based on probabilistic causal\nrelationships. Semantic models can simulate cognitive imagination because they\nensure the consistency of imaginary contexts and implement a glass-box approach\nthat allows the context to be manipulated as a holistic and coherent system of\ninterrelated facts glued together with causal relations."}

Under $N_{\\text{eff}}=2{,}000$, strongly dependent sequences\n($\\rho=0.8$) exhibit $\\approx76\\%$ smaller generalization gaps than weakly\ndependent ones ($\\rho=0.2$), challenging the intuition that dependence is\npurely detrimental.

First, we characterize these risks across seven key\ndimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and\norder.

To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the\nmost advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when\nhandling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM\nagents in complex and crucial domains."}

Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.
