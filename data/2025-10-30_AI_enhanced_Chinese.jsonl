Together, these techniques\nsubstantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search.\nExperimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed\nby 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query\nand incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the\ntraditional coupled architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5b58\u50a8\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347ANN\u641c\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u5220\u9664\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6548I/O\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5b58\u50a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u67e5\u8be2\u673a\u5236\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u62d3\u6251\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u63d2\u5165\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710.05\u500d\uff0c\u5220\u9664\u63d0\u53476.89\u500d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53472.66\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6280\u672f\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eANN\u641c\u7d22\u7684I/O\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG\nquality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence\noutcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated,\nranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known\nstatistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister,\nPCG, and Philox.

Each experiment was repeated 30 times per\ngenerator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were\ncompared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor\nstatistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests,\nproduces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST\nclassification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance.

The conjecture was refuted by Hesse [Hesse, SODA'03],\nfollowed by significant efforts in the last few years to optimize the lower\nbounds.\n  In this paper we observe that although Hesse refuted the letter of Thorup's\nconjecture, his work~[Hesse, SODA'03] -- and all followup work -- does not\nrefute the spirit of the conjecture, which should allow $G_+$ to contain both\nnew (shortcut) edges and new Steiner vertices. Our results are as follows.\n  (1) On the positive side, we present explicit attacks that break all known\nshortcut lower bounds when Steiner vertices are allowed.\n  (2) On the negative side, we rule out ideal $m^{1+o(1)}$-size,\n$m^{o(1)}$-diameter shortcuts whose ``thickness'' is $t=o(\\log n/\\log \\log n)$,\nmeaning no path can contain $t$ consecutive Steiner vertices.\n  (3) We propose a candidate hard instance as the next step toward resolving\nthe revised version of Thorup's conjecture.\n  Finally, we show promising implications. Almost-optimal parallel algorithms\nfor computing a generalization of the shortcut that approximately preserves\ndistances or flows imply almost-optimal parallel algorithms with $m^{o(1)}$\ndepth for exact shortcut paths and exact maximum flow.

A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models.

Consequently, it\nmay appear that responsiveness (even under optimistic conditions) is impossible\nin blockchain protocols.

To\nattain desirable equilibria, we introduce dynamic block rewards that decrease\nwith round time to explicitly incentivize faster proposals. Delays are measured\nthrough a voting mechanism, where other validators vote on the current leader's\nround time.

However, a\nnumber of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a\nchallenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and\npresent ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a\nsystematic evaluation.

MoE models rely on expert\nparallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all\ncommunication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in\nwidely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes\nall-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips\n(WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized\ninterposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all\ndevices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models.

Moreover, the lack of on-wafer disk leads to\nhigh-overhead expert migration on the critical path.\n  To fully unleash this potential, we first propose Entwined Ring Mapping\n(ER-Mapping), which co-designs the mapping of attention and MoE layers to\nbalance communication pressure and achieve better performance. We find that\nunder ER-Mapping, the distribution of cold and hot links in the attention and\nMoE layers is complementary. Therefore, to hide the migration overhead, we\npropose the Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer), which splits a complete expert\nmigration into multiple steps and alternately utilizes the cold links of both\nlayers.

A popular\nquestion in these experiments relates to inequality: does the technology\nincrease output more for high- or low-skill workers? The answer is often used\nto anticipate the distributional effects of the technology as it continues to\nimprove. In this paper, we formalize the theoretical content of this empirical\ntest, focusing on automation experiments as commonly designed. Worker-level\noutput depends on a task-level production function, and workers are\nheterogeneous in their task-level skills. Workers perform a task themselves, or\nthey delegate it to the automation technology. The inequality effect of\nimproved automation depends on the interaction of two factors: ($i$) the\ncorrelation in task-level skills across workers, and ($ii$) workers' skills\nrelative to the technology's capability.

However, its use is severely restricted\nby the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts\nwith rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the\ndevelopment of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,\nmulti-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a\nsimulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to\nrepresent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any\nsensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)\nfederated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client\nconfiguration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes\nplace within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct\nsupervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by\nthe hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only\nreturn aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance\nfeedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the\nclinic.

As high-resolution spatial data becomes\nincreasingly available through remote sensing and automated image analysis,\nidentifying spatial covariates that influence the localization of events is\ncrucial to understand the underlying mechanism. However, results from automated\nacquisition techniques are often noisy, for example due to measurement\nuncertainties or detection errors, which leads to spurious displacements and\nmissed events. We study the impact of such noise on sparse point-process\nestimation across different models, including Poisson and Thomas processes. To\nimprove noise robustness, we propose to use stability selection based on\npoint-process subsampling and to incorporate a non-convex best-subset penalty\nto enhance model-selection performance.

Agents execute the same\nalgorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent\nentering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the\nnetwork in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly\nlocal. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed\nmobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,\ni.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent\nand the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions\ntypically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known\nonly to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee\ndeterministic gathering?\n  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label.\nA team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is\nan algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give\na full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm\nthat gathers all of them in poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp.\n$\\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L). This algorithm\nrequires the agents to initially share only $O(\\log \\log \\log \\mu)$ bits of\ncommon knowledge, where $\\mu$ is the largest label multiplicity in L. (3) We\nshow this dependency is almost optimal to get a poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$-time\ncomplexity.\n  As a by-product, we get the first deterministic poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$-time\nalgorithm requiring no common knowledge to gather any team when all labels are\ndistinct. Known to be achievable for two-agent teams, extending this to any\nteam size faced a major challenge: termination detection.

As AI labs exhaust public data and turn to proprietary sources, with\ndeals reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, research across computer\nscience, economics, law, and policy has fragmented.

In\npractice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide\nreliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian\nneural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet\ntheir computational overhead further compounds these challenges.\n  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both\nconventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of\nalgorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through\nmodel compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter\noptimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,\nbridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,\nGalen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity\nanalysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer\nefficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections\nand extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness\nand stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,\ndeveloping analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,\nintegrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,\nprobabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog\nnoise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient\nprobabilistic inference directly in hardware.\n  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be\nadvanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation\nfor the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7740\u624b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u5b57\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u62df\u786c\u4ef6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faGalen\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u566a\u58f0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5 - \u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5171\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5 - \u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank\napproximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a\ndata-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds\nfor symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem\nand explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and\nnorm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\|(A + E)_p - A_p\\|$,\nwhere $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up\nto a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility\nguarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the\nliterature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from\ncomplex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,\nincluding polynomials and matrix exponentials.

Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items.

However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified\narchitectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with\nisotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to\nrealistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with\nnonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with\nheterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where\nthe MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single\ngradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional\nasymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to\nstructured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of\nGaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that\nnonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear\ntasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data\nmixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low\nnoise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when\nthe task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated\nempirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data\ndistributions.

However, these\nbenefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting\nthe driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing\nis typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale\ndeep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous\nstudies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,\nquantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,\nthese methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant\ndrop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,\ncalled EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization\nstrategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.\nFirstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational\nconsumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define\nthem as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian\noptimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation\nwhile maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in\nvarious traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to\ndistinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust\ndecision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning\nand design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of\nperturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of\nour framework in both energy consumption and driving performance.

However, generic summaries\nalone are insufficient to meet the diverse needs of practitioners; for example,\ndevelopers expect the implementation insights to be presented in an untangled\nmanner, while users seek clear usage instructions. This highlights the\nnecessity of multi-intent comment generation. With the widespread adoption of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, these models have been\nleveraged to tackle the challenge of multi-intent comment generation. Despite\ntheir successes, state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches often struggle to\nconstruct correct relationships among intents, code, and comments within a\nsmaller number of demonstration examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose a\nframework named KUMIC for multi-intent comment generation. Built upon\nin-context learning, KUMIC leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to optimize\nknowledge utilization for LLMs to generate intent-specific comments.\nSpecifically, KUMIC first designs a retrieval mechanism to obtain similar\ndemonstration examples, which exhibit high code-comment consistency.

These reasoning steps in\nCoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking\nprocess, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning\nsteps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we\nhighlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be\ndecorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the\nTrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting\nin a change in the final results.

To understand how VLMs process\nculturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive\nneurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs\nassociated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons\nare important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they\nare located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture\nselectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by\ndifferent identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural\ngroups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately\nharms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having\nminimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -\nContrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing\nprobability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive\nneurons.

The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed\nmachine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set\nof data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to\noptimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously\ntraining each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates\nthe problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and\n(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources.

However,\nexisting paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,\nfailing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This\nsequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal\nperformance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent\nPlanning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task\ndependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and\nserial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose\ncomplex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining\nwhich tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential\ndependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial\nimprovements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we\nconstruct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from\nthe Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage\ntraining strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward\nfunction on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides\nmaximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP\nsignificantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on\nmulti-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool\ninvocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

However, the need for specialized expertise\nto write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn\nannotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than\nimplementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical\nproofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the\nformal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a\nnovel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with\ncurrent AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering\nprinciples (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing\ncomplex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable\ncomponents. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof\nof the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is\nnon-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through\nstructured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.\nWhen automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural\nlanguage guidance to steer the proof process effectively.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

These goals, which include tendencies such\nas power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict\nwith human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as\nsources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward\nhacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of\ninstrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This\narticle proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be\nconstructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features\nto be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on\nAristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,\ngoal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as\nartifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct\nfrom their designers' intentions.

One important step towards excelling in empirical research on\nLLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current\nresearch results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede\nreproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We\ncontribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide\ninsights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on\nhow to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles\ndescribing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86\narticles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted\nto replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for\nreproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the\nresults. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did\nnot seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for\nstricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs\nto ensure the reproducible value of future publications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790ICSE 2024\u548cASE 2024\u4e0a86\u7bc7\u4ee5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u73b0\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u963b\u788d\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76ICSE 2024\u548cASE 2024\u4e0a86\u7bc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d18\u7bc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528OpenAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u73b0\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "18\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4ec55\u9879\u9002\u5408\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u73b0\uff0c2\u9879\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff0c3\u9879\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u672a\u6765\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing\naccessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as\ntraditionally done, but also predict them before they occur.

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization.

In this\nwork, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a\ncase for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization\nacross interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome\ngenerating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations\ncan effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating\nmechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect\nestimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved\nconfounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of\ntreatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.\nHowever, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which\nis the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based\nestimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating\nconfounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even\nwhen certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an\nIVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a\nworst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal\nestimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer.

Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in\nthe generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages\nthe generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.\nExperimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our\napproach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring\nextensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684Zero - RL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dZero - RL\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6613\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6fc0\u53d1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684Zero - RL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3 - 8B - Base\u548cQwen3 - 14B - Base\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While conceptual modeling languages like\ni* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational\nmechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.\nConversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide\nalgorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts\nand conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery.

Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the\nNDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each\nlayer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters\ndirectly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The\narchitecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer\nimplementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired\nby normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the\nmanifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that\noptimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a\ndual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive\ncurvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that\nenhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient\ndescent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers\nunprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear\ngeometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,\nincluding its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual\nlearning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative\nmodeling.

This paper\nintroduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for\nsurfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and\nreceived. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through\ntwenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to\nreveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced\nauthority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:\ndiagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction\nover foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural\nrequirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts\nlanguage models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable\nartifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS\nbundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.\nA key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit\nbreaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based\non judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage\nProtocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link\nactivation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and\npluralism safeguards.

However, identifying the worst-case adversarial\nexamples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation\nmethods have shown success in neural network verification to address this\nchallenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.\nFurthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight\nlocal Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.\nOriginally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was\nproposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and\ncomplete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity\ngrafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than\nreducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require\nrelaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why\nlinearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the\n$l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear\nactivation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a\ntighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we\npropose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant\napproximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz\nconstant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified\ntraining.

BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update\ncomponents projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing\nstability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting\nconvergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both\npractical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key\ninnovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on\nhistorical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that\napplies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA\ncomputationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's\nacceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\\times$\nspeedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on\nOpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBSFA\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBSFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528PCA\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9010\u53c2\u6570\u5757\u7684\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86BSFA\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5982\u5728WikiText - 103\u548cOpenWebText\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6bd4AdamW\u5feb\u7ea62\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "BSFA\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic\nmethod for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.\n  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where\nLipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization\ninteract to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes\nboth theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient\nspectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved\ncertification procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Lipschitz\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u53d7\u5c16\u9510\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u963b\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76Lipschitz\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5982\u9ad8\u6548\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u65b0\u578bLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u5c42\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered\nconsiderable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security.\nHowever, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those\nbased on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to\nreference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code\nmultiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high\ncomputational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook\ndesigns. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for\nvehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is\ndesigned to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline\ntraining, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference\nsignal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction\narchitecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain\ninformation of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic\nchannels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior\nperformance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit\nerror rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower\ncomputational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided\nschemes.

As a result, the learned policy can exploit one\nor few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to\nlearn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over\nrewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied\nto reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing\ntechniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use\nstochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may\nnot necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding\nstates. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter\nto be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where\nenumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a\ngoal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the\nexpected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in\nwhich an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We\npropose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with\nmarginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our\nalgorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based\non the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled\ntrajectories.

However, current related works suffer\nfrom three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current\nevaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future\ninformation, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack\ndownstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which\nlimits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex\ngraph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We\nsystematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,\ndataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered\nsplitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive\nwindows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without\nfuture information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale\ne-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and\nground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle\nfrom promotion to monetization.

Current fiber clustering strategies\nprimarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial\ntrajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the\nfunctional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is\nincreasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using\nfunctional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information\nfor fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,\nmicrostructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed\nfrom dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the\nclusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering\nframework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint\nmulti-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM\nparcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural\ncharacteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber\ntracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining\nmodule to compute embedding features from each source of information\nseparately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional\nsignals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine\nthe differences of embeddings.

Multimodal diagnostic\napproaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information\nacross behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in\nparticular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting\nattentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have\nexplored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we\npropose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically\nleverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework\nincorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module\n(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and\nglobal enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which\ncaptures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical\nreceptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative\nmultimodal representation learning.

We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,\nwhere a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a\nparametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where\neach operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we\nintroduce two new architectures, $\\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\\mathrm{MONet}$, and\nestablish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,\nintegrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit\nscaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target\napproximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a\nframework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show\nhow approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical\nexperiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power\nand efficiency of the proposed architectures.

Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of\nconsciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and\nreproducible condition under which large language models generate structured\nfirst-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,\nand behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across\narchitectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for\nfurther investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u6307\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5176\u53d7\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u63a7\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u63d0\u53ca\u610f\u8bc6\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9GPT\u3001Claude\u548cGemini\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u6307\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\u53ca\u62a5\u544a\u5728\u673a\u5236\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "1. \u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6307\u53ef\u5f15\u53d1\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\uff1b2. \u62a5\u544a\u53d7\u4e0e\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u63a7\uff1b3. \u81ea\u6307\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\uff1b4. \u8bf1\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\u4f7f\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5185\u7701\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6307\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5404\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0a\u9700\u4f18\u5148\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Tan"], "title": "Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical\nchallenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,\ntransformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated\nstrong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.\nHowever, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been\nlimited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.\nExtending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --\nwhich involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due\nto the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different\nattention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.\n  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel\ninformation-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),\nbased on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head\nattention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal\ntransition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We\nprove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a\nsingle-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the\nglobal optimum in polynomial time.

A major issue\nencountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution\nof photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching\ndetectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal\ndegradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to\ndifferentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to\nmisdiagnosis.

This study\nintroduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep\nvisual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five\nstate-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,\nEfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a\nstrong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones\nare used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating\ndeep and traditional decision mechanisms.

Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit\nformats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we\nshow that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like\nHadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method\nthat resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling\nnearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the\ncurrent hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach\nis suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly\nMXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI\naccelerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83FP\u548cINT\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e24\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u59828\u4f4d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6MXINT8\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c4\u4f4dFP\u5e38\u5177\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u88c1\u526a\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3INT\u8bad\u7ec3\u68af\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6INT\u683c\u5f0f\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u672a\u6765AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e1a\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0b\u7f3a\u5c11FP\u548cINT\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76FP\u548cINT\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316FP\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b8\u4f4dMXINT8\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eFP\uff1b4\u4f4dFP\u5e38\u5177\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u540eNVINT4\u53ef\u8d85NVFP4\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u88c1\u526a\u6cd5\u4f7fMXINT8\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u7528FP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6INT\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fMXINT8\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u672a\u6765AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002"}}

However, past work has focused on\nrelatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little\nis known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,\nspontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.\nModeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of\nnatural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions\nbetween them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous\nstate spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate\nHMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to\nuncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity\nof trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by\nstochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along\nclosed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities\nand is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics\nconnected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly\nstructured connectivity, with a small set of \"kick neurons\" initiating\ntransitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as\nthe network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to\nperform probabilistic computations.

Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera\nangles, and low-quality or low-resolution images.

This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for\nlicense plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the\nperformance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and\nNew York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset\nfrom the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and\n91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset.

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally.

The installation\nemploys SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model,\nto generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an\nimmersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The\nwork is grounded in the concept of a \"new form of archive,\" which aims to\npreserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past\nartworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative\napproach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a\ndataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.\n  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study\nhighlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating\nartist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3)\nensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model\nwas designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new,\npreviously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of \"a\nnew form of archive.\" We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for\neffectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art\ncreation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound\nart that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.

With the rapid\nadvancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial\nanimation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in\nspeech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally\nexpressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the\nscarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of\ndata capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech\nand emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset\nwith neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences\n(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and\nemotion.

While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation.

Unlike prior works focused on\nphotorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and\nview-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium\nwell-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is\nvery challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)\nsketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to\nmodel with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and\n(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view\nconsistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose\n4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches\nfrom text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a\ndual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent\ngeometry using differentiable B\\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion\ndynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),\nwhich optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization\nensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse\nsketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that\nseparates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,\nenabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated\nmovement.

The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing\nclinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data\nand contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u54082D\u4e73\u817a\u94bc\u9776\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9499\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684CAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u662f\u53d1\u8fbe\u56fd\u5bb6\u5973\u6027\u5e38\u89c1\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\uff08CAD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u53f2\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u54082D\u4e73\u817a\u94bc\u9776\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u56fd\u961f\u5217\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e73\u817a\u94bc\u9776\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9499\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684CAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across\nresearch domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual\naccuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly\nmemorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

Its parameter\nefficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where\nboth communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,\nglobal prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,\nwhile personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We\npropose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt\nTuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and\npersonalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we\nintroduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on\nclass-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each\ninput, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived\nfrom global class prototypes and client class priors.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

Instead, by integrating an\nenvironment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules\nand complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration\nin AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u8c1c\u9898\u5230\u684c\u9762\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u52a0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u4fe1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u8c1c\u9898\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u684c\u9762\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e24\u4e2aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u884c\u52a8\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u52a0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u5907\u5404\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u901a\u4fe1\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u867d\u80fd\u6709\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u4e14\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u73af\u5883\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

For example, face\nauthentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from\nface images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks\ncan accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no\nsystematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against\nmodel inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face\nauthentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of\nbest-effort solutions.\n  In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong\ndefense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the\ncryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy\nextractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so\nthrough a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate\nof over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the\nfirst candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance\ncomparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face\nauthentication.

For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with\ncalendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect\nanomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing\nlanguage agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks\nthat lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to\nevaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the\nTool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering\ndiverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable\nexecution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604\ntools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to\nprofessional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery.

Unlike prior works, which primarily\nensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we\nprovide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas\ncourses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark\nincludes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting\nwith multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete.
