Although LCBS naturally models rise-fall patterns in bioinformatics, finance, and signal analysis, the only previously documented solution was a quadratic dynamic program that needs \u03b8(nm) time and space. We show that this space barrier is not inherent: a refined rolling-row implementation evaluates the same recurrence in \u03b8(nm) time with only \u03b8(min(n, m)) additional memory. By isolating the M symbol matches and their C bitonic-compatible pairs, we cast LCBS as a longest-path problem in a sparse DAG and solve it in O((n + m) log n + M log M) time and O(M) space, which is asymptotically faster than the quadratic baseline whenever M << n m.

However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models.

However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNeuroCLIP\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eEEG\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06CLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cEEG - \u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u7406 - \u7b26\u53f7\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeuroCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728THINGS - EEG2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22Top - 1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe63.2%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd512.3%\uff0c\u8de8\u4e3b\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u53474.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we extensively tested FNOs on a variety of systems with non-linear and non-stationary properties, using a wide range of forcing functions to isolate failure mechanisms. FNOs stand out in modeling linear systems, regardless of complexity, while achieving near-perfect energy preservation and accurate spectral representation for linear dynamics. However, they fail on non-linear systems, where the failure manifests as artificial energy dissipation and manipulated frequency content. This limitation persists regardless of training dataset size, and we discuss the root cause through discretization error analysis. Comparison with LSTM as the baseline shows FNOs are superior for both linear and non-linear systems, independent of the training dataset size. We develop a spectrogram-based loss function that combines time-domain Mean Squared Error (MSE) with frequency-domain magnitude and phase errors, addressing the low-frequency bias of FNOs. This frequency-aware training eliminates artificial dissipation in linear systems and enhances the energy ratios of non-linear systems. The IEA 15MW turbine model validates our findings. Despite hundreds of degrees of freedom, FNO predictions remain accurate because the turbine behaves in a predominantly linear regime. Our findings establish that system non-linearity, rather than dimensionality or complexity, determines the success of FNO.

However, such collocation often leads to performance interference caused by antagonistic jobs that overconsume shared resources. Existing antagonist-detection approaches either rely on offline profiling, which is costly and unscalable, or use a sample-from-production approach, which suffers from noisy measurements and fails under multi-victim scenarios. We present PANDA, a noise-resilient antagonist identification framework for production-scale datacenters. Like prior correlation-based methods, PANDA uses cycles per instruction (CPI) as its performance metric, but it differs by (i) leveraging global historical knowledge across all machines to suppress sampling noise and (ii) introducing a machine-level CPI metric that captures shared-resource contention among multiple co-located tasks. Evaluation on a recent Google production trace shows that PANDA ranks true antagonists far more accurately than prior methods -- improving average suspicion percentile from 50-55% to 82.6% -- and achieves consistent antagonist identification under multi-victim scenarios, all with negligible runtime overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPANDA\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5e76\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u624b\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PANDA\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u6307\u4ee4\u5468\u671f\uff08CPI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u6291\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u673a\u5668\u7ea7CPI\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8c37\u6b4c\u751f\u4ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPANDA\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u771f\u6b63\u5bf9\u624b\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6000\u7591\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u4ece50 - 55%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523082.6%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u624b\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Specifically, sellers can incentivise participants in their auction to diffuse information about the auction through the network.

First, we introduce a logical formalism that captures the dynamics of diffusion and its strategic dimension. Second, for such a logic, we provide model-checking procedures that allow one to verify properties as the Nash equilibrium, and that pave the way towards checking the existence of sellers' strategies.

As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\\%, 0.3\\% to 1.5\\%, and over 1.5\\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share.

This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4 - \u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u4f20\u67d3\u5168\u7403\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u4f30\u5371\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653f\u7b56\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "motivation": "2008\u5e74\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u66b4\u9732\u94f6\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4f20\u67d3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752828\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6156\u5bb6\u673a\u6784\u7684\u53cc\u8fb9\u66b4\u9732\u6570\u636e\uff082007 - 2023\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cc\u91cd\u5dee\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u94f6\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u91d1\u878d\u4f20\u67d3\u5168\u7403\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u6269\u6563\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u4f30\u5371\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5371\u673a\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u653e\u5927\uff1b\u94f6\u884c\u5408\u5e76\u6096\u8bba\u4e2d\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9a\u5411\u8d44\u672c\u8981\u6c42\u653f\u7b56\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u5ba1\u614e\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u660e\u786e\u7eb3\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u3002"}}

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "ASP\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6237\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4eba\u9700\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8981\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790AMR\u56fe\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b8c\u6574ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

Lock-free concurrent queue with coordination-free memory reclamation", "summary": "The queue is conceptually one of the simplest data structures-a basic FIFO container. However, ensuring correctness in the presence of concurrency makes existing lock-free implementations significantly more complex than their original form. Coordination mechanisms introduced to prevent hazards such as ABA, use-after-free, and unsafe reclamation often dominate the design, overshadowing the queue itself. Many schemes compromise strict FIFO ordering, unbounded capacity, or lock-free progress to mask coordination overheads. Yet the true source of complexity lies in the pursuit of infinite protection against reclamation hazards--theoretically sound but impractical and costly. This pursuit not only drives unnecessary complexity but also creates a protection paradox where excessive protection reduces system resilience rather than improving it. While such costs may be tolerable in conventional workloads, the AI era has shifted the paradigm: training and inference pipelines involve hundreds to thousands of concurrent threads per node, and at this scale, protection and coordination overheads dominate, often far heavier than the basic queue operations themselves.\n  This paper introduces Cyclic Memory Protection (CMP), a coordination-free queue that preserves strict FIFO semantics, unbounded capacity, and lock-free progress while restoring simplicity. CMP reclaims the strict FIFO that other approaches sacrificed through bounded protection windows that provide practical reclamation guarantees. We prove strict FIFO and safety via linearizability and bounded reclamation analysis, and show experimentally that CMP outperforms state-of-the-art lock-free queues by up to 1.72-4x under high contention while maintaining scalability to hundreds of threads.

Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simulation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query predictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation.

DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.\n  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.\n  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver >98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling.

A paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it: planning through belief-intent co-evolution", "summary": "We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Inspired by cognitive science, we propose that effective planning arises not from reconstructing the world, but from the co-evolution of belief and intent within a minimal set of semantically rich tokens. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, 11k+ samples) reveal three principles: (1) sparse intent tokens alone achieve 0.487 m ADE, demonstrating strong performance without future prediction; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.382 m, a 21.6% improvement, showing that performance emerges from cognitive planning; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss degrades performance, confirming that task-driven belief-intent co-evolution suffices under reliable perception inputs. Crucially, we observe the emergence of cognitive consistency: through prolonged training, the model spontaneously develops stable token dynamics that balance current perception (belief) and future goals (intent). This process, accompanied by \"temporal fuzziness,\" enables robustness under uncertainty and continuous self-optimization. Our work establishes a new paradigm: intelligence lies not in pixel fidelity, but in the tokenized duality of belief and intent. By reframing planning as understanding rather than reaction, TIWM bridges the gap between world models and VLA systems, paving the way for foresightful agents that plan through imagination.

Key tasks in this process, such as schema matching and entity resolution, are essential but often require significant effort. Although previous studies have aimed to automate these tasks, the influence of dataset characteristics on the matching effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined, and combinations of different methods remain limited. This study introduces a contextual graph embedding technique that integrates structural details from tabular data and contextual elements such as column descriptions and external knowledge. Tests conducted on datasets with varying properties such as domain specificity, data size, missing rate, and overlap rate showed that our approach consistently surpassed existing graph-based methods, especially in difficult scenarios such those with a high proportion of numerical values or significant missing data.

Our approach integrates Time-Integrated Deep Operator Networks (TI-DeepONets) as differentiable PDE surrogate models within the Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC)-a self-supervised learning framework for constrained neural control policies. The TI-DeepONet architecture learns temporal derivatives and couples them with numerical integrators, thus preserving the temporal causality of infinite-dimensional PDEs while reducing error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. Within DPC, we leverage automatic differentiation to compute policy gradients by backpropagating the expectations of optimal control loss through the learned TI-DeepONet, enabling efficient offline optimization of neural policies without the need for online optimization or supervisory controllers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method learns feasible parametric policies across diverse PDE systems, including the heat, the nonlinear Burgers', and the reaction-diffusion equations. The learned policies achieve target tracking, constraint satisfaction, and curvature minimization objectives, while generalizing across distributions of initial conditions and problem parameters. These results highlight the promise of combining operator learning with DPC for scalable, model-based self-supervised learning in PDE-constrained optimal control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TI - DeepONets\u548cDPC\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdPDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06TI - DeepONets\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5faePDE\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230DPC\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cdPDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eDPC\u5728PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

The regret is defined as the sum of individual player regrets measured by the utility gap with respect to the optimal item bundle given the prices. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $\u0394$-regret equilibria, where we establish a connection to the duality gap and the integrality gap of the social welfare problem. For the special case of monotone valuations, the derived necessary and sufficient optimality conditions coincide and lead to a complete characterization of achievable $\u0394$-regret equilibria. For general valuations, we establish an interesting connection to the area of sensitivity theory in linear optimization. We show that the sensitivity gap of the optimal-value function of two (configuration) linear programs with changed right-hand side can be used to establish a bound on the achievable regret. Finally, we use these general structural results to translate known approximation algorithms for the social welfare optimization problem into algorithms computing low-regret Walras equilibria.

In this paper, we use a large language model (LLM) to construct a generative agent (GA) that determines the probability of adopting one of the two strategies based on current information. The probabilities of strategy adoption are compared with those in the HAM literature for the S\\&P 500 index between 1990 and 2020.

Using Indian equities (NIFTY constituents), we run a rolling 48m/1m walk-forward evaluation at horizon k = 1 day and dial cross-sectional complexity via the universe size U in {5, 11, 21, 36} while keeping the reasoning budget fixed (B = 512 tokens) for the TLLM.

Statistical confidence is measured with Diebold-Mariano, Pesaran-Timmermann, and SPA tests.\n  Main findings.\n  (i) As U grows under a fixed budget B, the TLLM's ranking quality deteriorates, whereas the direct LLM remains flat and classical baselines are stable.\n  (ii) TLLM variance is higher, requiring ex-post calibration (winsorization and blending) for stability.\n  (iii) Portfolio results under transaction costs do not support a net advantage for the TLLM.\n  Hypotheses.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations.

Four major cloud providers by market share AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) are compared across Intel, AMD, and ARM general purpose instance types under both on-demand and one-year discounted pricing. AWS consistently delivers the shortest runtime in all three instance types, yet charges a premium, especially for on-demand usage. OCI emerges as the most economical option across all CPU families, although it generally runs workloads more slowly than AWS. Azure often exhibits mid-range performance and cost, while GCP presents a mixed profile: it sees a notable boost when moving from Intel to AMD. On the other hand, its ARM instance is more than twice as slow as its own AMD offering and remains significantly more expensive. AWS's internal comparisons reveal that its ARM instance can outperform its Intel and AMD siblings by up to 49 percent in runtime. These findings highlight how instance choices and provider selection can yield substantial variations in both runtime and price, indicating that workload priorities, whether raw speed or cost minimization, should guide decisions on instance types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2dOpenMP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b50\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2dHPC\u98ce\u683cCPU\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u5927\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u865a\u62df\u5316\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2dHPC\u98ce\u683cCPU\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SPEC ACCEL\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2dOpenMP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9AWS\u3001Azure\u3001GCP\u548cOCI\u56db\u5927\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u5728Intel\u3001AMD\u548cARM\u901a\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6309\u6309\u9700\u548c\u4e00\u5e74\u6298\u6263\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "AWS\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u77ed\u4f46\u6536\u8d39\u9ad8\uff1bOCI\u6700\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u6162\uff1bAzure\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u5c45\u4e2d\uff1bGCP\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\uff1bAWS\u7684ARM\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8d85Intel\u548cAMD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fbe49%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5e94\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

The supplemental video is available publicly at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZ15MfCgtI", "summary": "State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping.

Stable software versions continuously evolve to fix bugs, add improvements, address security issues, and ensure compatibility. This ongoing support involves Backporting, which means taking a fix or update from a newer version and applying it to an older version of the same software. As software versions evolve, new technical debt can arise during backport maintenance activities. This study examines the technical debt involved in fixing 105,396 commits from 31,076 backport sources across 87 repositories in three software ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, and Python). The goal is to identify when and why new technical debt arises during backporting in stable source code. Our results indicate that approximately 4.3% of backports introduce new technical debt. Apache contributes the most absolute instances, while Python and Eclipse exhibit nearly three times higher debt-to-commit ratios than Apache. Feature migrations make older Apache releases debt-prone in the early phase, whereas Python and Eclipse releases tend to accumulate technical debt mostly during the middle phase of their release cycles. Additionally, developers who are inexperienced, under high workloads, or non-owners are more likely to introduce technical debt during backporting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u7ef4\u62a4\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea64.3%\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u503a\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u65f6\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Apache\u3001Eclipse\u548cPython\uff0987\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d31,076\u4e2a\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u6e90\u7684105,396\u6b21\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "\u7ea64.3%\u7684\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff1bApache\u7edd\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6700\u591a\uff0cPython\u548cEclipse\u503a\u6bd4\u8fd1Apache\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u6613\u79ef\u7d2f\u503a\u52a1\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u503a\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u56de\u79fb\u690d\u5f15\u5165\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose \\PriLLM, a novel practical and scalable solution for real-time dynamic pricing in competitive LLM routing. \\PriLLM models the service market as a Stackelberg game, where providers set prices and users select services based on multiple criteria. To capture real-world market dynamics, we incorporate both objective factors (\\eg~cost, QoS) and subjective user preferences into the model. For scalability, we employ a deep aggregation network to learn provider abstraction that preserve user-side equilibrium behavior across pricing strategies. Moreover, \\PriLLM offers interpretability by explaining its pricing decisions.

We systematically searched five academic databases and grey literature following PRISMA guidelines and included 53 empirical studies that met predefined eligibility criteria. For each study we assessed risk of bias, with particular attention to how endogeneity, selection bias, and confounding were handled. Because of substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and research designs, results were synthesized narratively rather than through meta analysis. We find that a minority of studies, often using methods with higher risk of bias such as propensity score matching, report no systematic adverse social effects. By contrast, a large body of work using stronger quasi experimental designs, especially instrumental variable strategies, links IMF conditionality to higher income inequality, worse health outcomes (notably tuberculosis and child mortality), and growth of the informal economy.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment.

However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing.

CheetahGIS enjoys excellent scalability due to its modular architecture, which clearly decomposes different components and allows scaling individual components. To improve the efficiency and scalability of CheetahGIS, we devise a suite of optimizations, e.g., lightweight global grid-based index, metadata synchroniza tion strategies, and load balance mechanisms.

However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings.

Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $\u03b1$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $\u03b1$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks.

Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling.

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage.

Financial time series (TS) patterns are influenced by both short-term public opinions and medium-/long-term policy and market trends. Hence, processing multi-period inputs becomes crucial for accurate financial time series forecasting (TSF).

In this paper, we propose a Multi-period Learning Framework (MLF) to enhance financial TSF performance. MLF considers both TSF's accuracy and efficiency requirements. Specifically, we design three new modules to better integrate the multi-period inputs for improving accuracy: (i) Inter-period Redundancy Filtering (IRF), that removes the information redundancy between periods for accurate self-attention modeling, (ii) Learnable Weighted-average Integration (LWI), that effectively integrates multi-period forecasts, (iii) Multi-period self-Adaptive Patching (MAP), that mitigates the bias towards certain periods by setting the same number of patches across all periods. Furthermore, we propose a Patch Squeeze module to reduce the number of patches in self-attention modeling for maximized efficiency. MLF incorporates multiple inputs with varying lengths (periods) to achieve better accuracy and reduces the costs of selecting input lengths during training.

While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone.

This introduces unnecessary delays on the critical path of the application, limiting throughput. In this paper, we re-think synchronization for tasks that are scheduled entirely in the userspace (e.g., coroutines, fibers, etc.).

Recently, researchers have proposed many deep learning approaches to detect software vulnerabilities. However, their accuracy is limited in practice. One of the main causes is low-quality training data (i.e., source code). To this end, we propose a new approach: SPLVD (Self-Paced Learning for Software Vulnerability Detection). SPLVD dynamically selects source code for model training based on the stage of training, which simulates the human learning process progressing from easy to hard. SPLVD has a data selector that is specifically designed for the vulnerability detection task, which enables it to prioritize the learning of easy source code. Before each training epoch, SPLVD uses the data selector to recalculate the difficulty of the source code, select new training source code, and update the data selector. When evaluating SPLVD, we first use three benchmark datasets with over 239K source code in which 25K are vulnerable for standard evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that SPLVD achieves the highest F1 of 89.2%, 68.7%, and 43.5%, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches.

A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions.

This paper studies how LLMs, through lowering writing costs, disrupt markets that traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify the extent to which an application is tailored to a given job posting. Taking the measure to the data, we find that employers have a high willingness to pay for workers with more customized applications in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. To isolate and quantify the effect of LLMs' disruption of signaling on equilibrium outcomes, we develop and estimate a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We use the estimated model to simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs render written applications useless in signaling workers' ability. Without costly signaling, employers are less able to identify high-ability workers, causing the market to become significantly less meritocratic: compared to the pre-LLM equilibrium, workers in the top quintile of the ability distribution are hired 19% less often, workers in the bottom quintile are hired 14% more often.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u5199\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5199\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e02\u573a\uff08\u5982\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4f7f\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u62e9\u4f18\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5199\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5199\u4f5c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Freelancer.com\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u96c7\u4e3b\u613f\u610f\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u652f\u4ed8\u9ad8\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u5219\u4e0d\u7136\uff1b\u6a21\u62df\u65e0\u5199\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e02\u573a\u62e9\u4f18\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u5199\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96c7\u4e3b\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u5de5\u4eba\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u62e9\u4f18\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability.

These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. We show that the long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated with the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit. We use the model and quasi-exogenous variation in demand to estimate love-of-variety. We find it to be significantly higher than implied by CES aggregation, suggesting that even the long-run effects of recessions are negative.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions.

They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.\n  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model.

However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management.\n  We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering.\n  SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00SPADA\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u7f16\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u91cf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FPGA\u548cCGRA\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u89c6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7f16\u7a0b\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPADA\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8bed\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9Cerebras CSL\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3002", "result": "SPADA\u80fd\u8ba9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7528\u6bd4CSL\u5c116 - 8\u500d\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u8fbe\u590d\u6742\u5e76\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u5f31\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "SPADA\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6b64\u7c7b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\\mathsf{G}\\mathsf{F}\\varphi$, where $\\varphi$ is a co-safety formula.

This paper addresses this gap using detailed data on Italian graduates and university programs. I study the labor market returns to combinations of bachelor's and master's degrees and investigate how curriculum characteristics affect outcomes. I exploit exogenous variation in access to bachelor's and master's degrees to causally estimate the returns to 43 combinations of degrees. I organize the data in a nested model with exogenous variation in admission requirements and explore the preference profile of the sample through policy simulations that shift these requirements. I then relate the estimated returns to the academic curriculum of degrees, focusing on the role of quantitative education and timing of courses. I contribute to the literature on returns to advanced degrees by incorporating master's degrees in the discussion on how higher education affects outcomes and providing evidence on the characteristics of curricula that are positively related to labor market returns. The findings reveal substantial variation in returns to degree combinations, even among combinations with the same bachelor's degree, indicating the need to consider both types of programs. Combinations of degrees in different disciplines positively impact economic outcomes, while those in the same field perform worse.

Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures.

This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Claude Code\u914d\u7f6e\u751f\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790328\u4e2a\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u52a9\u624b\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e86\u89e3\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5206\u6790328\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u516c\u5171Claude Code\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4e2d\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f3a\u8c03\u6307\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u5178\u7ecf\u6d4e\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6218\u7565\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6216\u96c6\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u4f2f\u7279\u5170\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6709\u5747\u8861\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u6218\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u53e4\u8bfa\u4ea7\u91cf\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u8d77\u521d\u4f7f\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u540e\u5411\u5747\u8861\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u662f\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u8f6f\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c2\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5747\u8861\u5efa\u8bae\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u5efa\u8bae\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u6027\u5408\u8c0b\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u8bae\u53cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u8bae\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f71\u54cd\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8c28\u614e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \u03c3Z$, where $\u03c3\\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\u03c3^4)$ and $O(\u03c3^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.\n  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \\[ \\mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \u03c3^2 \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \\[ \\mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y), \\] \\[ \\mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \\frac{\u03c3^2}{2} \\nabla \\log q(y) - \\frac{\u03c3^4}{8} \\nabla \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\| \\nabla \\log q(y) \\|^2 + \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\log q(y) \\right) . \\]", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5c42\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ec5\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u4e0d\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u53bb\u566a\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u53d7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f97\u5206\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a8\u8350\u7528\u65b0\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5728\u5339\u914d\u5e7f\u4e49\u77e9\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230 $O(\u03c3^4)$ \u548c $O(\u03c3^6)$ \u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u6709\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e94\u66ff\u4ee3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002"}}

The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f39\u6027\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u76d1\u6d4b\u5371\u9669\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u5f53\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "Argus\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u9632\u6b6264.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u4e14\u989d\u5916\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

TEMPERATURE: ITS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL IN SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY, VOLUME 9: Proceedings of the Tenth International Temperature Symposium 3-7 April 2023 Anaheim, USA", "summary": "Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a \"plateau\" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection.

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments.

Through signature verification, smart contracts can ensure that signers possess the required permissions, thus enhancing security and scalability. However, lacking checks on signature usage conditions can lead to repeated verifications, increasing the risk of permission abuse and threatening contract assets. We define this issue as the Signature Replay Vulnerability (SRV). In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to investigate the causes and characteristics of the SRVs. From 1,419 audit reports across 37 blockchain security companies, we identified 108 with detailed SRV descriptions and classified five types of SRVs. To detect these vulnerabilities automatically, we designed LASiR, which utilizes the general semantic understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in the static taint analysis of the signature state and identify the signature reuse behavior. It also employs path reachability verification via symbolic execution to ensure effective and reliable detection. To evaluate the performance of LASiR, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15,383 contracts involving signature verification, selected from the initial dataset of 918,964 contracts across four blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. The results indicate that SRVs are widespread, with affected contracts holding $4.76 million in active assets. Among these, 19.63% of contracts that use signatures on Ethereum contain SRVs. Furthermore, manual verification demonstrates that LASiR achieves an F1-score of 87.90% for detection. Ablation studies and comparative experiments reveal that the semantic information provided by LLMs aids static taint analysis, significantly enhancing LASiR's detection performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7b7e\u540d\u91cd\u653e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08SRV\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1LASiR\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSRV\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0cLASiR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7b7e\u540d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u68c0\u67e5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b7e\u540d\u91cd\u653e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u9650\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece37\u5bb6\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u516c\u53f8\u76841419\u4efd\u5ba1\u8ba1\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b108\u4efd\u8be6\u7ec6SRV\u63cf\u8ff0\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1LASiR\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u9759\u6001\u6c61\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "SRV\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u5408\u7ea6\u6301\u6709476\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6d3b\u8dc3\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e0a19.63%\u4f7f\u7528\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5408\u7ea6\u6709SRV\uff1bLASiR\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe87.90%\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b7e\u540d\u91cd\u653e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLASiR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8be5\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u96be\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u8fc7Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u5f81\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LyapInf\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u63a8\u65ad\u7684Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u7403\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDP - PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7bDP\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6536\u655b\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u6539\u5584\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DPSGD\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4f1a\u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDP - PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8870\u51cf\u9ad8\u9891DP\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e25\u683cDP\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2aDPSGD\u53d8\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDP - PMLF\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DP - PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7bDP\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1 - \u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \\textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures.

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff08CSTs\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PCA\u548cVNNs\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "PCA\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u548c\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cVNNs\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u70b9\u63d0\u51faCSTs\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCovariance Scattering Transforms\uff08CSTs\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\u6ce2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8ePCA\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSTs\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "CSTs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PCA\u548cVNNs\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral.

By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US.

Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations.

Webb", "Geoffrey Mackellar"], "title": "EEG-X: Device-Agnostic and Noise-Robust Foundation Model for EEG", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.HC"], "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark.

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates.

Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability.

This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition.

Results: In this application, we introduce DeepDR, the first integrated platform that combines a variety of established DL-based models for disease- and target-specific drug repositioning tasks. DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Additionally, the recommended results include detailed descriptions of the recommended drugs and visualize key patterns with interpretability through a knowledge graph.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5931\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728AntMaze\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08Physical AI\uff09\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u516d\u8981\u7d20\u5e76\u4ee5\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u8d2f\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u9610\u8ff0Physical AI\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u516d\u8981\u7d20\u6784\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u660e\u516d\u8981\u7d20\u6784\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4ea7\u751f\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Physical AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2dTAC\u503c\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTAC\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0TAC\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8feb\u4f7f\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u66ff\u4ee3TAC\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c0fL2\u8303\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u6270\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR - 10\u3001GTSRB\u548cTinyImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6291\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability.

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR)\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE)\u6a21\u578b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u989d\u5916\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSinkhorn\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u5c06token\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5206\u914d\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSSR\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSSR\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u635f\u574f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "SSR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e73\u8861\u7684token\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e3a\u745e\u5178\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfSPARA\uff0c\u5229\u7528RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u745e\u5178\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ba1\u7406\u7269\u4e1a\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u6b27\u76df\u6709\u80fd\u6e90\u7b49\u7ea7\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u6e90\u6539\u9020\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfSPARA\uff0c\u5229\u7528RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u6e90\u987e\u95ee\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u90ae\u4ef6\u901a\u4fe1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "SPARA\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u8bd5\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power.

FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions.

In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements!

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent.

We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size.

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4.

Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness.

To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs.

Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets.

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDFDT\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4RTG\u4ee4\u724c\u5931\u53bb\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdDT\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFDT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u878d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528MMD\u5339\u914d\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001OT\u5339\u914d\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "DFDT\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We estimate at least 122M of samples exhibit some indication of copyright notice in CommonPool, and find that 60\\% of the samples in the top 50 domains come from websites with ToS that prohibit scraping. Furthermore, we estimate 9-13\\% with 95\\% confidence interval of samples from CommonPool to contain watermarks, where existing watermark detection methods fail to capture them in high fidelity.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u56e0\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u9884\u8b66\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u6784\u6297\u566a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6f14\u5458 - \u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u523b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure!

In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction.

In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency.

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

Huber"], "title": "Efficiently Transforming Neural Networks into Decision Trees: A Path to Ground Truth Explanations with RENTT", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models.

However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMixture - of - Channels\uff08MoC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FFNs\uff09\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aFFN\u6fc0\u6d3b\u662f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MoC\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SwiGLU\u7684\u539f\u751f\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u9009\u62e9Top - K\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u52a0\u8f7d\u6743\u91cd\u5230GPU SRAM\u3002", "result": "MoC\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MoC\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop.

Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution.

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5WOODELF\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u79cd\u503c\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97SHAP\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u80cc\u666fShapley\u503c\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u9700162\u79d2\uff0cGPU\u4e0a\u970016\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u670916\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u7684\u63d0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301SHAP\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6PTE\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001IIoT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8 - \u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

Discovery Requires Chaos", "categories": ["math.DS", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "math.NA", "nlin.CD"], "comment": "20 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.\n  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u6c8c\u5bf9\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u552f\u4e00\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u6c8c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u975e\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u552f\u4e00\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u6574\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5947\u602a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u4e0a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6216\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ece\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b\u5947\u602a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u4e0a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b\u7ecf\u5178\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b\u975e\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u52a9\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u6c8c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

This is a pre-print of an accepted paper at ICDMW: SABID 2025", "summary": "Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction.

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions.

While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks.

Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faiSeal\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u572812\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5bf9\u8d8510\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6307\u7eb9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u7eb9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiSeal\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u6ce8\u5165\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "iSeal\u572812\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5bf9\u8d8510\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6307\u7eb9\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6307\u7eb9\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u64cd\u7eb5\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "iSeal\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u6297\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths.

MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAMOS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAA - MAMORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MAMOS\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u56e0\u79c1\u6709\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAA - MAMORL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u72ec\u7acb\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49MAMO\u7c92\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6807\u51c6MOMALand\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u597d\u548cAA - MAMORL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AA - MAMORL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9MAMOS\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM.

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578bPAN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u52aa\u529b\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "PAN\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\uff08GLP\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891 - \u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "PAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u5411\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u3002"}}

However, with the wide application of Class-Incremental Learning (CIL), models are no longer static and need to be updated with new data distributed and labeled differently from the old ones. As a result, existing AEs often fail after CIL updates due to significant domain drift. In this paper, we propose SAE to enhance the sustainability of AEs against CIL. The core idea of SAE is to enhance the robustness of AE semantics against domain drift by making them more similar to the target class while distinguishing them from all other classes. Achieving this is challenging, as relying solely on the initial CIL model to optimize AE semantics often leads to overfitting. To resolve the problem, we propose a Semantic Correction Module. This module encourages the AE semantics to be generalized, based on a visual-language model capable of producing universal semantics. Additionally, it incorporates the CIL model to correct the optimization direction of the AE semantics, guiding them closer to the target class. To further reduce fluctuations in AE semantics, we propose a Filtering-and-Augmentation Module, which first identifies non-target examples with target-class semantics in the latent space and then augments them to foster more stable semantics.

However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases.

However, two main challenges persist in existing methods: (1) the lack of explicit rhythm modeling hinders audiovisual temporal alignments; (2) effectively integrating various visual features to condition music generation remains non-trivial. To address these issues, we propose Diff-V2M, a general V2M framework based on a hierarchical conditional diffusion model, comprising two core components: visual feature extraction and conditional music generation. For rhythm modeling, we begin by evaluating several rhythmic representations, including low-resolution mel-spectrograms, tempograms, and onset detection functions (ODF), and devise a rhythmic predictor to infer them directly from videos. To ensure contextual and affective coherence, we also extract semantic and emotional features. All features are incorporated into the generator via a hierarchical cross-attention mechanism, where emotional features shape the affective tone via the first layer, while semantic and rhythmic features are fused in the second cross-attention layer. To enhance feature integration, we introduce timestep-aware fusion strategies, including feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) and weighted fusion, allowing the model to adaptively balance semantic and rhythmic cues throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments identify low-resolution ODF as a more effective signal for modeling musical rhythm and demonstrate that Diff-V2M outperforms existing models on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of objective metrics and subjective comparisons.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs.

As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance.

Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding.

To overcome this defect, This paper proposes a novel method, namely Fractal-Triggerred Distributed Backdoor Attack (FTDBA), which leverages the self-similarity of fractals to enhance the feature strength of sub-triggers and hence significantly reduce the required poisoning volume for the same attack strength. To address the detectability of fractal structures in the frequency and gradient domains, we introduce a dynamic angular perturbation mechanism that adaptively adjusts perturbation intensity across the training phases to balance efficiency and stealthiness.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity.

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes.

To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction.

Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights.

However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:\n  \\textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9009\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5bfc\u5411\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.\n  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).\n  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u7ea630%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u808c\u7535\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u5408\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u808c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6784\u5efa\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5d4c\u5165\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4e0a\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea630%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Such methods are easily bypassed by common password patterns (e.g., 'P@ssw0rd1!'), giving users a false sense of security. To address this, we implement and evaluate a password strength scoring system by comparing four machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression with a dataset of over 660,000 real-world passwords. Our primary contribution is a novel hybrid feature engineering approach that captures nuanced vulnerabilities missed by standard metrics.

To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions.

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.

It highlights the key steps that connect personal vision, structured experimentation, and lasting value creation, and shows how AI agents can act as digital co-founders throughout this journey. Building on research in entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, we present a framework with three key stages: (1) Imagination shaping, where vague goals become clear value propositions, supported by AI agents that help with market scanning, idea refinement, and rapid concept generation; (2) Reality testing, where these ideas are tested through low-cost experiments, structured feedback loops, and efficient execution, with AI agents automating tasks such as prototyping, content creation, customer interaction, and data analysis; and (3) Reality scaling, where successful ideas are transformed into repeatable processes, scalable market strategies, and long-term business models, increasingly operated and optimized by autonomous or semi-autonomous AI workflows.

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds.

Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains.
