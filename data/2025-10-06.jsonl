In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or\nmodels of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware\nof its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum\nstochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2\ndeceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an\nadvantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor\nselection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor\nselection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for\nselection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not\ndeviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper\nbound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1\nhas perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making\nalgorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the\npresumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value. Numerical\nexamples illustrate how Player 1 persistently chooses sensors that are\nconsistent with its priors, allowing Player 2 to systematically exploit its\ninattention."}

These limitations make current approaches\nill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud\ndeployments.\n  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that\nachieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE\ndecouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to\nproceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses\nweights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth\npeer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without\ninterrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism\nmigrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory\nusage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.\n  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that\nElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput\nduring scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to\nbaselines.

In brief, LDNF is a method which turns non-limited distinct attributes\ninto limited distinct attributes by forcing the attributes to conform to a\nlimited quantity of values.

Instead, real world improvements in\ncompression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific\ncompressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of\nthe data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best\ngeneric compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not\nwithout drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are\ndifficult to maintain and deploy.\n  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking\nabout compression.

This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that\ncompresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which\ncan be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid\ndevelopment of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder\neliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard\ncomponent library minimizes security risks.

To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models.

This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that\ncompresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which\ncan be decompressed by a universal decoder.

Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models.

Although no data is actively altered, such\nreconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational\nbehavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this\nthreat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and\noften disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single\ntimeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx,\nimproving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the\ntrustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client\ndevices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate\nheterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive\nperturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits.

To this\nend, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft\nmodel estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target\nmodel and selectively skips communication and computation for server\noperations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection\nprobability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the\npath deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference\nperformance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid\ninference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while\nlowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without\nskipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model\nonly inference."}

The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a\nhigher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software\nunder analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to\ndetermine whether tests pass or not.\n  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage\nmetric.

Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We\ninvestigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability\nmethods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make\nabout the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about\nthose explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to\nan XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying\nassumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring\nthe underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a\ngiven application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI\nmethods for different domains of application."}

We\nintroduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug\nabstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the\nagentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that\nare unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug.

This paper presents a comparative study of\nadversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard\nadversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more\nresilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering\n(PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text\ninto a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then\nquantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein\ndistance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the\nclassifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our\nPIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and\nsentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional\nadversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against\nsemantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its\nTrue Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%.

Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss.

To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals.

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three.

A balanced signed\ngraph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph\nvia similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices.

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the\ninsight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting.\nWithout modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two\nmechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by\ncomparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a\ndual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons''\nstored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles\nand enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show\nthat A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while\nincurring a minimal utility cost.

Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was\nfine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data\nincluded paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical\nreports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans\nwere labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model\nwas evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,\nglaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical\nsectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,\nprecision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using\nstandard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and\n0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86\n(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction\naccuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and\ntemporal sectors.

While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm\n(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution\nshifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To\naddress this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware\nQ-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect\ndistribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty\nestimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between\nexploration and exploitation.

By leveraging self\nattention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and\nspatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse\nintrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline\nand supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection\nwithin a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone\nAnomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,\ndemonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in\nmulticlass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while\nmaintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable\nparameters.

A shortcut\nto achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the\ntraining data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark\ncontamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,\ncontaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those\nunseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,\nevade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings\nreveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could\neasily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while\nleaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the\nfairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards.\nThis underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods\nand trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs."}

The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our\nmethod recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%\non stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of\nadversarial attacks."}

We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER\ntokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference\npositions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate\ncoordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial\nencoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,\naddressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on\nScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in\ngrounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution\ninterfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on\nimplicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across\ndiverse resolutions and platforms."}

Reward models assess\nthe quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is\nalso performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI\nmodel. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to\nredundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include\nsusceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,\nmethods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our\nposition paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help\novercome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward\nmodels on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.\nGrounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer\nalignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference\nelicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and\ncalibration-aware meta-evaluation."}
