### [1] [Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885)
*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究人工神经网络能否形成类似生物镜像神经元的模式，以及对AI内在对齐的作用，发现合适条件可形成相关模式并支持合作行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向超人类能力发展，现有对齐策略可能不足，研究人工神经网络形成镜像神经元模式对AI内在对齐的作用。

Method: 使用青蛙和蟾蜍游戏框架，确定镜像神经元模式出现的条件，评估其对动作回路的影响，引入CMNI量化激活强度和一致性，并提出理论框架。

Result: 合适的模型容量和自他耦合能使人工神经网络形成类似生物镜像神经元的共享神经表征，支持合作行为。

Conclusion: 通过镜像神经元动态建模的内在动机可嵌入AI架构，补充现有对齐技术。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

### [2] [Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02071)
*Xinyi Lin,Yuyang Zhang,Yuanhang Gan,Juntao Chen,Hao Shen,Yichun He,Lijun Li,Ze Yuan,Shuang Wang,Chaohao Wang,Rui Zhang,Na Li,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了人机共体智能，以APEX系统为例展示其在科研和制造中的应用及优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型局限于虚拟领域，现实科研和制造依赖人工，导致可重复性、可扩展性和可访问性受限。

Method: 提出人机共体智能，将人类、智能AI和可穿戴硬件集成，通过可穿戴界面实现人机沟通；展示APEX系统，利用混合现实结合智能推理与物理执行。

Result: APEX系统在洁净室柔性电子制造中，实现上下文感知推理，实时纠错，向新手传授专业知识。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的智能类型，将智能推理拓展到物理领域，使科研和制造更自主、可追溯、可解释和可扩展。

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

### [3] [Automated Reward Design for Gran Turismo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02094)
*Michel Ma,Takuma Seno,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter R. Wurman,Peter Stone,Craig Sherstan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文展示如何用基础模型基于文本指令为《跑车浪漫旅7》游戏搜索奖励函数，生成有竞争力的赛车智能体并产生新行为，为现实应用自动化奖励设计奠基。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将期望行为映射到奖励函数是困难的过程，尤其是在像自动驾驶赛车这样的复杂环境中，需要有效的方法来设计奖励函数。

Method: 结合基于大语言模型（LLM）的奖励生成、基于视觉语言模型（VLM）偏好的评估以及人类反馈。

Result: 生成了与冠军级RL赛车智能体GT Sophy有竞争力的赛车智能体，并产生了新的行为。

Conclusion: 该系统为现实世界应用中的实用自动化奖励设计铺平了道路。

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [4] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Deep Value Benchmark (DVB)评估框架测试大语言模型是否学习到人类深层价值观，实验显示模型深层价值泛化率低且大模型更差，还发布数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分大语言模型是学习到人类深层价值观还是仅表面偏好，对AI对齐很关键。

Method: DVB采用新实验设计，训练阶段让模型接触深层和浅层特征相关的人类偏好数据，测试阶段打破关联，测量模型的Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR)。

Result: 9个不同模型平均DVGR仅0.30，所有模型深层价值泛化低于随机水平，大模型DVGR略低于小模型。

Conclusion: DVB为对齐的核心特征提供了可解释的衡量方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

### [5] [InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02119)
*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 美国洪水保险参与率低，需理解保险决策行为机制。研究用大语言模型评估保险购买概率有局限，提出InsurAgent模型有效解决问题，可用于行为建模和政策分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国洪水保险高危人群参与率低，需理解和建模保险决策行为机制，大语言模型可模拟人类决策。

Method: 构建基准数据集评估大语言模型能力，提出含感知、检索、推理、行动和记忆五个模块的InsurAgent模型，检索模块用RAG，推理模块借助大语言模型常识。

Result: 大语言模型有定性理解但定量概率估计不足，InsurAgent能准确估计边际和二元概率，捕捉传统模型难处理的上下文信息，模拟时间决策演变。

Conclusion: InsurAgent为行为建模和政策分析提供了有价值工具。

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

*Renos Zabounidis,Aditya Golatkar,Michael Kleinman,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Re - FORC自适应奖励预测方法，在推理模型上训练轻量级适配器，可实现多种推理优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种方法来优化推理过程，减少计算量并提高准确性。

Method: 在推理模型上训练轻量级适配器的自适应奖励预测方法。

Result: 1. 提前停止无前景推理链，减少26%计算量且保持精度；2. 优化模型和思考长度选择，相同计算量下准确率提高4%，相同准确率下计算量减少55%；3. 自适应测试时间缩放，高计算场景准确率提高11%，低计算场景提高7%。

Conclusion: Re - FORC可通过每令牌成本阈值进行长度控制的动态推理，并提前估算计算时间。

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

### [7] [Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194)
*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ATHENA框架解决个体决策模型与群体最优预测间的信息整合问题，经实验验证效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体决策模型常与群体最优预测存在差距，需解决最优信息整合问题。

Method: 基于效用理论，利用大语言模型能力，提出ATHENA框架，包含群体层面符号效用函数发现和个体层面语义自适应两个阶段。

Result: 在真实任务中，ATHENA表现优于其他模型，F1分数至少提升6.5%，消融实验表明两阶段都重要且互补。

Conclusion: ATHENA有机整合符号效用建模和语义自适应，为以人类为中心的决策建模提供新方案。

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

*Jingbo Wang,Sendong Zhao,Haochun Wang,Yuzheng Fan,Lizhe Zhang,Yan Liu,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出用于多智能体系统高效协作的STRMAC框架，实验显示其性能达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统因调度和协调策略不佳，无法充分发挥潜力，不能适应任务需求变化。

Method: 提出STRMAC框架，分别编码交互历史和智能体知识驱动路由器选择合适智能体，引入自进化数据生成方法加速高质量执行路径收集用于训练。

Result: 在协作推理基准测试中性能达SOTA，较基线提升23.8%，数据收集开销较穷举搜索减少90.1%。

Conclusion: STRMAC框架能有效提升多智能体系统协作效率和性能。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有工作主要关注任务成功，本文提出应优化生产力、主动性和个性化三个维度，引入UserVille环境和PPP方法，实验显示PPP训练的智能体有显著提升，强调以用户为中心交互的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注任务成功，而实际有效的智能体需优化生产力、主动性和个性化三个维度。

Method: 引入UserVille交互式环境和基于LLM的用户模拟器，提出多目标强化学习方法PPP来联合优化三个维度。

Result: 在软件工程和深度研究任务实验中，PPP训练的智能体比GPT - 5等强基线平均提升21.6，能提出战略澄清问题、适应未见用户偏好并提升任务成功率。

Conclusion: 明确优化以用户为中心的交互对构建实用有效的AI智能体至关重要。

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

*Changjiang Jiang,Fengchang Yu,Haihua Chen,Wei Lu,Jin Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出框架解决大语言模型在表格数据复杂推理中表现不佳问题，引入新数据集，实验显示框架性能优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在表格数据复杂推理中因复杂查询、噪声数据和数值能力有限而表现不佳。

Method: 提出包含查询分解器、表格清理器和基于PoT的推理器的框架，引入新数据集CalTab151。

Result: 框架在TAT - QA、TableBench等上准确率分别提升8.79%、6.08%和19.87%，能与主流大语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 框架能有效提升大语言模型在复杂表格数值推理中的性能。

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for
complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究创意生成方法过于简单，忽略科学概念间复杂上下文关系，且未能有效利用科学概念网络，因此需新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Deep Ideation框架，集成捕捉关键词共现和上下文关系的科学网络，引入探索 - 扩展 - 进化工作流，用Idea Stack跟踪进度，使用基于真实评审反馈训练的批评引擎提供反馈。

Conclusion: Deep Ideation框架能有效提升研究创意生成的质量和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出新框架将模态跟随分解为相对推理不确定性和固有模态偏好两个因素，构建可控数据集验证，发现模态跟随概率与相对不确定性的关系，揭示振荡内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往工作仅用粗粒度数据集统计衡量模态跟随行为，忽略模型单模态推理置信度影响，本文旨在深入研究模态跟随的影响因素。

Method: 引入新框架，构建可控数据集，用熵作为细粒度不确定性指标，探测层预测。

Result: 发现模态跟随概率随相对不确定性增加而单调递减，在平衡点可衡量固有偏好，揭示振荡内部机制。

Conclusion: 相对不确定性和固有模态偏好是模态跟随的两个基本原则，为多模态大语言模型解决冲突信息提供定量框架和机制洞察。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

Conclusion: 所提专家系统可辅助医护人员识别高风险患者，确定是否需进一步诊断。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

Result: 得到 PR 估计风险的极小极大上界，拓展了文献中的一些 PR 指标。

Conclusion: 提出的新框架在生成模型 PR 曲线估计方面有一定效果，可拓展现有指标并适用于不同实验设置。

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理复杂长周期任务时因依赖单一轨迹而存在局限，需改进。

Method: 提出ReAcTree，将复杂目标分解为子目标，利用代理树处理，集成两种互补记忆系统。

Result: 在WAH - NL和ALFRED数据集上，ReAcTree表现优于ReAct等基线方法，如在WAH - NL上用Qwen 2.5 72B实现61%目标成功率，接近ReAct两倍。

Conclusion: ReAcTree在处理复杂长周期任务的任务规划方面有优势。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Motivation: 现有研究在开放式任务中忽视推理能力的潜在价值，探究强化推理能否提升开放式任务的表现。

Method: 引入Verifiable Multiple - Choice Reformulation (VMR)，将开放式数据重构为可验证的多项选择格式进行训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，在八个开放式基准测试中，基于VMR的训练比基线平均提高5.99分。

Conclusion: 提出的VMR策略能有效提高大语言模型在开放式任务上的性能，代码将在接受后发布以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Motivation: 5G和6G网络复杂，手动优化无效，而Agentic AI无既定框架和通用定义，需开展相关研究。

Method: 先介绍Agentic AI的演变，阐述核心设计模式，再结合移动网络背景，给出5G RAN案例。

Result: 展示了时间序列分析和大模型驱动的智能体如何协作进行基于KPI的自主决策。

Conclusion: 为5G和6G网络中的Agentic AI研究提供概念框架和实际应用案例。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代游戏迭代快更新频繁，现有基于大语言模型的自动测试方法缺乏知识积累机制，难以针对增量更新进行精准高效测试。

Method: 构建并维护知识图谱对游戏元素等进行系统建模，利用大语言模型解析更新日志，通过知识图谱多跳推理确定影响范围，生成定制化测试用例。

Result: 在《Overcooked》和《Minecraft》两款游戏中实验表明，KLPEG能更准确找出受更新影响的功能，用更少步骤完成测试。

Conclusion: KLPEG框架显著提高了游戏测试的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Result: 五款模型准确率45 - 63%，错误主要是四舍五入和计算错误；在数学和工程领域表现强，物理和自然科学领域弱；模型常共同失败但错误类型有差异，具有部分互补性。

Conclusion: ORCA基准能评估逐步推理、数值精度和领域泛化能力，与标准数学数据集不同。

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

Motivation: 经典屏蔽方法常为静态，环境假设被违反时无法适应，需要自适应方法。

Method: 基于GR(1)规范开发自适应屏蔽框架，运行时检测环境假设违反，用归纳逻辑编程在线系统且可解释地修复GR(1)规范。

Result: 在Minepump和Atari Seaquest案例中，静态符号控制器优化辅助奖励时欠佳，配备自适应屏蔽的强化学习智能体比静态屏蔽有接近最优的奖励和完美的逻辑合规性。

Conclusion: 所提出的自适应屏蔽框架有效，能让屏蔽优雅进化，必要时才弱化目标。

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

Motivation: 分析大语言模型的组合空间推理能力。

Method: 创建DecompSR数据集，可独立改变组合性的多个方面，用符号求解器验证正确性，并对多个大语言模型进行基准测试。

Conclusion: DecompSR是可证明正确且严格的基准数据集，能对大语言模型的组合推理能力进行稳健且细粒度的探测。

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Method: 提出协作迷宫求解基准，评估32个开源和闭源模型在不同配对下的表现。

Result: 发现协作差距，即单智能体表现好的模型协作时性能大幅下降，接力推理方法可缩小差距。

Conclusion: 建议进行协作感知评估、开发提升协作能力的训练策略和可靠激发智能体潜在技能的交互设计。

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型代理评估主要关注任务完成，忽略资源效率和适应性，缺乏对代理制定和调整成本最优计划能力的评估。

Method: 引入CostBench基准，位于旅行规划领域，包含多种成本的原子和复合工具任务，支持四种动态阻塞事件。

Result: 在CostBench上评估领先模型，发现成本感知规划存在显著差距，静态设置下代理常无法找到成本最优解，动态条件下性能下降约40%。

Conclusion: CostBench诊断出模型弱点，为开发经济合理且健壮的未来代理奠定基础。

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

Motivation: 客户端需求超越聊天完成，推理服务器仍针对聊天完成优化，此前工作仅针对单一用例 RAG 优化，需更通用解决方案。

Method: 引入跨度查询，它是推理调用的表达式树，带有交换性约束，描述其语法和语义，自动优化以提高 KV 缓存局部性，对 vLLM 做小改动以支持执行。

Result: 跨度查询能将两个非聊天用例的首次响应时间降低 10 - 20 倍，注意力优化的跨度查询在 2b 参数模型上的准确性远超 8b 模型的普通推理服务器。

Conclusion: 跨度查询是一种通用且有效的推理服务器接口，可提高性能和准确性。

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

Result: 在多模态情感识别基准测试案例研究中揭示了系统的可靠性特征。

Conclusion: 框架为多模态推理提供诊断支架，支持对融合动态进行原则性审计并为可能的干预措施提供信息。

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

Motivation: 现有表格上下文学习架构存在单尺度特征处理、密集注意力计算复杂度高、组件处理顺序严格等局限性，需改进。

Method: 引入Orion - MSP架构，包括多尺度处理、块稀疏注意力和Perceiver风格内存。

Result: Orion - MSP在多样基准测试中达到或超越现有最优性能，能有效扩展到高维表格。

Conclusion: Orion - MSP为高效表格上下文学习树立新标准，代码公开。

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI部署变复杂且风险高，需评估其风险，而好的控制评估需引出强攻击策略，但在复杂环境中因计算限制数据少，引出强攻击策略有挑战。

Method: 将攻击能力分解为五项技能分别优化；开发攻击动态的概率模型，用模拟优化攻击超参数并迁移到SHADE - Arena。

Result: 攻击强度显著提升，使用该方法将安全分数从基线0.87降至0.41。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化攻击策略的方法在评估AI风险方面有效，能提升攻击强度。

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

Motivation: 现有自动化科研AI在行动连贯性和发现深度上受限，需更好的自动化数据驱动发现方案。

Method: Kosmos使用结构化世界模型，在数据分析和文献搜索代理间共享信息，执行多轮并行数据分析、文献搜索和假设生成。

Result: 独立科学家发现报告中79.4%的陈述准确，一次20轮运行相当于6个月人工研究时间，发现数量与运行轮数线性相关。

Conclusion: Kosmos能有效自动化数据驱动发现，有多项科学发现，对科学研究有积极贡献。

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

Result: 描述了逻辑语义和神经网络通过框架的联系，回顾了突出方法技术，给出框架的形式定义。

Conclusion: 提出逻辑可作为AI形式化的合适框架，语义编码框架有助于解决深度学习和神经符号AI缺乏通用条件的问题。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Conclusion: 该框架基于代理设计，能无缝集成专业基础模型，具有适应性、透明性和可解释性，且模块化易扩展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法为散热器设计提供新基础，可高效探索复杂几何。

Abstract: We present a B\'ezier-based Multi-Fidelity Thermal Optimization Framework,
which is a computationally efficient methodology for the global optimization of
3D heat sinks. The flexible B\'ezier-parameterized fin geometries and the
adopted multi-fidelity pseudo-3D thermal modeling strategy meet at a balance
between accuracy and computational cost. In this method, the smooth and compact
B\'ezier representation of fins defines the design space from which diverse
topologies can be generated with minimal design variables. A global optimizer,
the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, minimizes the pressure
drop with respect to a given surface-average temperature constraint to achieve
improvement in the pressure loss. In the framework, the pseudo-3D model couples
two thermally interacting 2D layers: a thermofluid layer representing the fluid
domain passing through the fins, and a conductive base plate representing the
surface where excessive average temperature is to be avoided. Both layers are
coupled with calibrated heat transfer coefficients obtained from high-fidelity
3D simulations. For several fin geometries, the proposed framework has been
validated by comparing the pseudo-3D results with those of full 3D simulations,
which yielded good agreement in terms of temperature distribution and pressure
drops when the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude.
Optimization results show that it attains up to 50\% pressure loss reduction
compared to conventional straight-fin configurations, and it reveals a clear
trade-off between thermal performance and hydraulic efficiency. Thus, the
proposed method forms a new basis for fast, geometry-flexible, and optimized
heat sink design, enabling efficient exploration of complex geometries.

Conclusion: 所提3D-WMoCo框架能有效解决现有3D SGMs方法的局限，实现更好的MRI运动伪影校正效果。

Abstract: Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain a major
challenge, as they degrade image quality and compromise diagnostic reliability.
Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promise for artifact
removal. However, existing 3D SGM-based approaches are limited in two key
aspects: (1) their strong dependence on known forward operators makes them
ineffective for correcting MRI motion artifacts, and (2) their slow inference
speed hinders clinical translation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
wavelet-optimized end-to-end framework for 3D MRI motion correct using
pre-trained 2D score priors (3D-WMoCo). Specifically, two orthogonal 2D score
priors are leveraged to guide the 3D distribution prior, while a mean-reverting
stochastic differential equation (SDE) is employed to model the restoration
process of motion-corrupted 3D volumes to motion-free 3D distribution.
Furthermore, wavelet diffusion is introduced to accelerate inference, and
wavelet convolution is applied to enhance feature extraction. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach through both simulated motion artifact
experiments and real-world clinical motion artifact correction tests. The
proposed method achieves robust performance improvements over existing
techniques. Implementation details and source code are available at:

Conclusion: 基于随机转移系统结合资源队列建模的事件日志增强技术效果较好，且事件日志增强技术更适合处理过程约束问题。

Abstract: Process mining analyzes and improves processes by examining transactional
data stored in event logs, which record sequences of events with timestamps.
However, the effectiveness of process mining, especially when combined with
machine or deep learning, depends on having large event logs. Event log
augmentation addresses this limitation by generating additional traces that
simulate realistic process executions while considering various perspectives
like time, control-flow, workflow, resources, and domain-specific attributes.
Although prior research has explored event-log augmentation techniques, there
has been no comprehensive comparison of their effectiveness. This paper reports
on an evaluation of seven state-of-the-art augmentation techniques across eight
event logs. The results are also compared with those obtained by a baseline
technique based on a stochastic transition system. The comparison has been
carried on analyzing four different aspects: similarity, preservation of
predictive information, information loss/enhancement, and computational times
required. Results show that, considering the different criteria, a technique
based on a stochastic transition system combined with resource queue modeling
would provide higher quality synthetic event logs. Event-log augmentation
techniques are also compared with traditional data-augmentation techniques,
showing that the former provide significant benefits, whereas the latter fail
to consider process constraints.

Abstract: Defect phase diagrams provide a unified description of crystal defect states
for materials design and are central to the scientific objectives of the
Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1394. Their construction requires the
systematic integration of heterogeneous experimental and simulation data across
research groups and locations. In this setting, research data management (RDM)
is a key enabler of new scientific insight by linking distributed research
activities and making complex data reproducible and reusable.
  To address the challenge of heterogeneous data sources and formats, a
comprehensive RDM infrastructure has been established that links experiment,
data, and analysis in a seamless workflow. The system combines: (1) a joint
electronic laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system,
(2) easy-to-use large-object data storage, (3) automatic metadata extraction
from heterogeneous and proprietary file formats, (4) interactive provenance
graphs for data exploration and reuse, and (5) automated reporting and analysis
workflows. The two key technological elements are the openBIS electronic
laboratory notebook and laboratory information management system, and a newly
developed companion application that extends openBIS with large-scale data
handling, automated metadata capture, and federated access to distributed
research data.
  This integrated approach reduces friction in data capture and curation,
enabling traceable and reusable datasets that accelerate the construction of

Result: 在标准基准测试中，相比基线方法，查询准确性、解释清晰度和用户满意度显著提高。

Conclusion: 结合基于规则的方法和大语言模型驱动的细化能创建更易访问和健壮的SPARQL接口。

Abstract: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained
challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex
syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To
address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query
generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations
(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.
InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce
structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),
followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine
queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the
correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate
InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in
query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to
baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of
combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more
accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.

Motivation: 现有ML服务平台使用批处理优化吞吐量，存在不可预测的尾延迟问题，而AI集成应用会带来服务级别延迟目标（SLOs）。

Method: Vortex采用SLO优先的方法。

Result: 对于相同任务，Vortex的管道在广泛的工作负载下比TorchServe和Ray Serve实现了显著更低且更稳定的延迟，通常能以两倍以上的请求速率实现给定的SLO目标；有RDMA时优势更显著。

Conclusion: Vortex的SLO优先方法在ML推理和知识检索服务中有良好表现，能更好满足服务级别延迟目标。

Abstract: There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval
as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more
demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user
applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter
cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving
platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to
unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For
identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable
latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often
enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is
available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理多对多关系，为数据仓库模型设计提供新思路。

Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach to implement specific relation-ship set
between two entities called combinatorial relationship set. For the
combinatorial relationship set B between entity sets G and I the mapping
cardinality is many-to-many. Additionally, entities from G can be uniquely
encoded with a pair of values (h, k) generated with the procedure for numbering
combinations of entities from I. The encoding procedure is based on
combinatorial number system that provides a representation of all possible k
-combinations of a set of n elements by a single number. In general
many-to-many relationship sets are represented by a relation or table, while
the combinatorial relationship is not physically stored as separate table.
However, all information is encapsulated into a single column added to G. The
new column is a candidate key in G. Additional operation named Rank-Join to
fundamental relational-algebra is presented to combine information from g and i
associated with a combinatorial relationship set. Motivation for combinatorial
relationship originates from challenges in designing and implementing
multivalued dimensions and bridge tables in data-warehouse models.

Result: 在测试集上的广泛计算实验表明，该方法在大多数检查的阈值上显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 所提算法在图相似性搜索中表现良好，能提升性能。

Abstract: The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the
similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost
required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary)
edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs
is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard
theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be
mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints,
which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given
threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED
constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the
filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while
the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and
the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based
on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound
dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed
efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that
uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer
programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive
computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the
examined thresholds.

Result: EasyTUS在平均精度均值上提升达34.3%，数据准备加速79.2倍，查询处理性能加快7.7倍，在无元数据设置下也表现良好。

Conclusion: EasyTUS在表联合搜索任务中高效、可扩展、鲁棒且适应性强，能推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Data lakes enable easy maintenance of heterogeneous data in its native form.
While this flexibility can accelerate data ingestion, it shifts the complexity
of data preparation and query processing to data discovery tasks. One such task
is Table Union Search (TUS), which identifies tables that can be unioned with a
given input table. In this work, we present EasyTUS, a comprehensive framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform efficient and scalable
Table Union Search across data lakes. EasyTUS implements the search pipeline as
three modular steps: Table Serialization for consistent formatting and
sampling, Table Representation that utilizes LLMs to generate embeddings, and
Vector Search that leverages approximate nearest neighbor indexing for semantic
matching. To enable reproducible and systematic evaluation, in this paper, we
also introduce TUSBench, a novel standardized benchmarking environment within
the EasyTUS framework. TUSBench supports unified comparisons across approaches
and data lakes, promoting transparency and progress in the field. Our
experiments using TUSBench show that EasyTUS consistently outperforms most of
the state-of the-art approaches, achieving improvements in average of up to
34.3% in Mean Average Precision (MAP), up to 79.2x speedup in data preparation,
and up to 7.7x faster query processing performance. Furthermore, EasyTUS
maintains strong performance even in metadata-absent settings, highlighting its
robustness and adaptability across data lakes.

*Daren Chao,Kaiwen Chen,Naiqing Guan,Nick Koudas*

TL;DR: 提出ReDD框架解决非结构化数据提取挑战，实验证明其有效降低错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG缺乏模式感知且跨文档对齐困难，错误率高，需解决非结构化数据提取问题。

Method: 提出ReDD框架，含迭代模式发现（ISD）和表格数据填充（TDP）两阶段，还有SCAPE和SCAPE - HYB方法。

Result: 在不同数据集实验中，将数据提取错误率从最高30%降至1%以下，保持高模式完整性和精度。

Conclusion: ReDD模块化设计可细粒度控制准确率 - 成本权衡，是处理非结构化语料库高风险分析查询的可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Unstructured data is pervasive, but analytical queries demand structured
representations, creating a significant extraction challenge. Existing methods
like RAG lack schema awareness and struggle with cross-document alignment,
leading to high error rates. We propose ReDD (Relational Deep Dive), a
framework that dynamically discovers query-specific schemas, populates
relational tables, and ensures error-aware extraction with provable guarantees.
ReDD features a two-stage pipeline: (1) Iterative Schema Discovery (ISD)
identifies minimal, joinable schemas tailored to each query, and (2) Tabular
Data Population (TDP) extracts and corrects data using lightweight classifiers
trained on LLM hidden states. A main contribution of ReDD is SCAPE, a
statistically calibrated method for error detection with coverage guarantees,
and SCAPE-HYB, a hybrid approach that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy
and human correction costs. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate
ReDD's effectiveness, reducing data extraction errors from up to 30% to below
1% while maintaining high schema completeness (100% recall) and precision.
ReDD's modular design enables fine-grained control over accuracy-cost
trade-offs, making it a robust solution for high-stakes analytical queries over
unstructured corpora.

Abstract: Cloud is now the leading software and computing hardware innovator, and is
changing the landscape of compute to one that is optimized for artificial
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Computing innovation was initially
driven to meet the needs of scientific computing. As industry and consumer
usage of computing proliferated, there was a shift to satisfy a multipolar
customer base. Demand for AI/ML now dominates modern computing and innovation
has centralized on cloud. As a result, cost and resource models designed to
serve AI/ML use cases are not currently well suited for science. If resource
contention resulting from a unipole consumer makes access to contended
resources harder for scientific users, a likely future is running scientific
workloads where they were not intended. In this article, we discuss the past,
current, and possible futures of cloud cost models for the continued support of
discovery and science.

Motivation: 大型加权无向图中精确求解器扩展搜索边界会增加时间和内存成本。

Result: 在大型网络上比Louvain路由、METIS管道和Dijkstra在运行时间和最优性差距上表现更好。

Conclusion: SPHERE方法有效，独立于下游求解器且能暴露子问题并行性。

Abstract: We study shortest-path routing in large weighted, undirected graphs, where
expanding search frontiers raise time and memory costs for exact solvers. We
propose \emph{SPHERE}, a source-target-aware heuristic that identifies an
$s$-$t$ overlap: vertices that are close to both $s$ and $t$ in hop count.
Selecting an anchor $a$ in this overlap partitions the task into two
subproblems with unchanged problem-topology, $s\to a$ and $a\to t$; if either
remains large, the procedure recurses on its induced subgraph. Because the cut
lies inside the overlap, concatenating the resulting subpaths yields a valid
$s\to t$ route without boundary repair. SPHERE is independent of the downstream
solver (e.g., Dijkstra) and exposes parallelism across subproblems. On large
networks, it achieves faster runtimes and smaller optimality gaps than
Louvain-based routing and a METIS-based pipeline, even on graphs with more than
a million nodes and edges, while also outperforming Dijkstra in runtime.

Conclusion: EdgeReasoning为推理大语言模型的最优边缘部署提供了系统的指导。

Abstract: Edge intelligence paradigm is increasingly demanded by the emerging
autonomous systems, such as robotics. Beyond ensuring privacy-preserving
operation and resilience in connectivity-limited environments, edge deployment
offers significant energy and cost advantages over cloud-based solutions.
However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks on edge
GPUs faces critical challenges from strict latency constraints and limited
computational resources. To navigate these constraints, developers must balance
multiple design factors - choosing reasoning versus non-reasoning
architectures, selecting appropriate model sizes, allocating token budgets, and
applying test-time scaling strategies - to meet target latency and optimize
accuracy. Yet guidance on optimal combinations of these variables remains
scarce. In this work, we present EdgeReasoning, a comprehensive study
characterizing the deployment of reasoning LLMs on edge GPUs. We systematically
quantify latency-accuracy tradeoffs across various LLM architectures and model
sizes. We systematically evaluate prompt-based and model-tuning-based
techniques for reducing reasoning token length while maintaining performance
quality. We further profile test-time scaling methods with varying degrees of
parallelism to maximize accuracy under strict latency budgets. Through these
analyses, EdgeReasoning maps the Pareto frontier of achievable accuracy-latency
configurations, offering systematic guidance for optimal edge deployment of
reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: 所提出的学习方法在预测吞吐量和编译图速度方面有良好表现。

Abstract: Mapping a dataflow-graph of an ML model onto a reconfigurable system is
difficult, as different mappings have different throughputs and consume
resource constraints differently. To solve this, a model to evaluate the
throughput of mappings is necessary as measuring throughput completely is
expensive. Many use a hand-designed analytical model, relying on proxy features
or intuition, introducing error. We provide a Learned Approach that predicts
throughput 31%-52% more accurately over a variety of graphs. In addition, our
approach shows no accuracy degradation after removing performance annotations.
We show that using this approach results in 5.6% faster compiled graphs.

Result: 在应用提供商一定的虚拟机租赁预算下，HGraphScale 最多可减少 80.16%的平均响应时间，优于现有方法

Conclusion: HGraphScale 是一种有效的自动伸缩方法，能更好应对微服务资源伸缩问题

Abstract: Microservice architecture has become a dominant paradigm in application
development due to its advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and
resilient. Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud
enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective
approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However,
the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the
container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article
proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular,
HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a
newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling
actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments
based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale
outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at
most 80.16\% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of
application providers.

TL;DR: 提出Roadrunner实现WebAssembly无服务器函数近乎零拷贝和无序列化数据传输，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器函数数据传输的序列化和反序列化操作导致上下文切换和内存分配开销大，增加延迟和资源消耗。

Method: 设计Roadrunner边车垫片，通过映射函数内存和专用虚拟数据通道移动数据，绕过序列化和反序列化。

Result: 显著改善函数间通信延迟44% - 89%，减少97%数据传输的序列化开销，吞吐量提升69倍。

Conclusion: Roadrunner能为WebAssembly无服务器函数实现近乎原生的延迟性能。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides infrastructure management and elastic
auto-scaling, therefore reducing operational overhead. By design serverless
functions are stateless, which means they typically leverage external remote
services to store and exchange data. Transferring data over a network typically
involves serialization and deserialization. These operations usually require
multiple data copies and transitions between user and kernel space, resulting
in overhead from context switching and memory allocation, contributing
significantly to increased latency and resource consumption. To address these
issues, we present Roadrunner, a sidecar shim that enables near-zero copy and
serialization-free data transfer between WebAssembly-based serverless
functions. Roadrunner reduces the multiple copies between user space and kernel
space by mapping the function memory and moving the data along a dedicated
virtual data hose, bypassing the costly processes of serialization and
deserialization. This approach reduces data movement overhead and context
switching, achieving near-native latency performance for WebAssembly-based
serverless functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that Roadrunner
significantly improves the inter-function communication latency from 44% up to
89%, reducing the serialization overhead in 97% of data transfer, and
increasing throughput by 69 times compared to state-of-the-art
WebAssembly-based serverless functions.

Result: 能在2Kx2Kx2K的输入问题上扩展ADMM - FFT，相比原ADMM - FFT平均性能提升52.8%，最高达65.4%。

Conclusion: mLR有效解决了ADMM - FFT的计算和内存问题，提升了其性能。

Abstract: ADMM-FFT is an iterative method with high reconstruction accuracy for
laminography but suffers from excessive computation time and large memory
consumption. We introduce mLR, which employs memoization to replace the
time-consuming Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations based on an unique
observation that similar FFT operations appear in iterations of ADMM-FFT. We
introduce a series of techniques to make the application of memoization to
ADMM-FFT performance-beneficial and scalable. We also introduce variable
offloading to save CPU memory and scale ADMM-FFT across GPUs within and across
nodes. Using mLR, we are able to scale ADMM-FFT on an input problem of
2Kx2Kx2K, which is the largest input problem laminography reconstruction has
ever worked on with the ADMM-FFT solution on limited memory; mLR brings 52.8%
performance improvement on average (up to 65.4%), compared to the original
ADMM-FFT.

Result: GPoS使地理空间去中心化平均提升45%，在BFT协议中性能开销极小。

Conclusion: GPoS能提升地理空间去中心化，且对共识性能开销小。

Abstract: Geospatial decentralization is essential for blockchains, ensuring regulatory
resilience, robustness, and fairness. We empirically analyze five major Proof
of Stake (PoS) blockchains: Aptos, Avalanche, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui,
revealing that a few geographic regions dominate consensus voting power,
resulting in limited geospatial decentralization. To address this, we propose
Geospatially aware Proof of Stake (GPoS), which integrates geospatial diversity
with stake-based voting power. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an average
45% improvement in geospatial decentralization, as measured by the Gini
coefficient of Eigenvector centrality, while incurring minimal performance
overhead in BFT protocols, including HotStuff and CometBFT. These results
demonstrate that GPoS can improve geospatial decentralization {while, in our
experiments, incurring minimal overhead} to consensus performance.

Result: 应用该方法到关键内核，端到端延迟比基于BSP的方法有10 - 20%的加速。

Conclusion: 为分布式大语言模型工作负载建立了更具可编程性和效率的范式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their workloads
increasingly rely on distributed execution across multiple GPUs. However, the
conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings
introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these
bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel
Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We
propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in
distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we
gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of
novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and
performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns
systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level
producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained
dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from
the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the
complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end
latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and
efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.

Conclusion: 算子是扩展大型生成式工作负载更有效的基本单位。

Abstract: Serving large generative models such as LLMs and multi- modal transformers
requires balancing user-facing SLOs (e.g., time-to-first-token,
time-between-tokens) with provider goals of efficiency and cost reduction.
Existing solutions rely on static provisioning or model-level autoscaling, both
of which treat the model as a monolith. This coarse-grained resource management
leads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to
poor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.
  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of
generative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.
Through detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that
operators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit
diverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,
sequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the
operator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling
decisions.
  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources
at finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and
placement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale
traces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less
energy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less
energy. These results show that the operator, rather than the model, is
fundamentally a more effective unit for scaling large generative workloads.

Conclusion: 新调度算法能有效优化LQCD模拟中相关函数计算，提高时间和内存效率。

Abstract: Computation of correlation functions is a key operation in Lattice quantum
chromodynamics (LQCD) simulations to extract nuclear physics observables. These
functions involve many binary batch tensor contractions, each tensor possibly
occupying hundreds of MBs of memory. Performing these contractions on GPU
accelerators poses the challenge of scheduling them as to optimize tensor reuse
and reduce data traffic. In this work we propose two fast novel scheduling
algorithms that reorder contractions to increase temporal locality via
input/intermediate tensor reuse. Our schedulers take advantage of
application-specific features, such as contractions being binary and locality
within contraction trees, to optimize the objective of minimizing peak memory.
We integrate them into the LQCD analysis software suite Redstar and improve
time-to-solution. Our schedulers attain upto 2.1x improvement in peak memory,
which is reflected by a reduction of upto 4.2x in evictions, upto 1.8x in data
traffic, resulting in upto 1.9x faster correlation function computation time.

Abstract: The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep
learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point
cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for
3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,
leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge
devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging
Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split
Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby
reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the
risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep
neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after
voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution
time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced
by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.

*Xiumei Deng,Zehui Xiong,Binbin Chen,Dong In Kim,Merouane Debbah,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出Federated Attention (FedAttn)框架解决边缘端大语言模型协作场景问题，理论分析并通过实验验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在协作场景部署面临隐私、通信和计算挑战，需新解决方案。

Method: 将联邦范式集成到自注意力机制，提出FedAttn框架，参与者进行本地自注意力计算并交换聚合KV矩阵；分析结构对偶性以移植联邦优化技术；理论分析误差传播和权衡关系。

Result: 实验验证理论分析，发现稀疏注意力和自适应KV聚合的优化机会。

Conclusion: FedAttn有潜力在现实边缘部署中实现可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,
delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.
However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts
fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and
computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention
(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention
mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that
simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and
computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local
self-attention over their own token representations while periodically
exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer
blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private
prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual
representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across
private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight
provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated
optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this
framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within
participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error
propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the
fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation
efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of
participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and
reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and
adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver
scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.

*Johansell Villalobos,Josef Ruzicka,Silvio Rizzi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文给出两个科学计算应用使用四种性能可移植框架的初步求解时间结果，发现框架间性能差异大，需进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 百亿亿次计算时代对计算能力要求提升，异构计算架构下需要与供应商无关的性能可移植框架。

Method: 对N体模拟和结构化网格模拟两个应用，采用分布式内存方法和硬件加速，通过Kokkos、OpenMP、RAJA和OCCA四个框架在Polaris超级计算机单节点的四个NVIDIA A100 GPU上进行实验。

Result: 各框架性能差异显著，OCCA在小规模验证问题上执行时间快，但大规模模拟可扩展性可能受限；OpenMP在结构化网格模拟中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要进一步优化以发挥各框架最大能力，未来将在算法、通信、内存管理等方面开展工作。

Abstract: Scientific computing in the exascale era demands increased computational
power to solve complex problems across various domains. With the rise of
heterogeneous computing architectures the need for vendor-agnostic, performance
portability frameworks has been highlighted. Libraries like Kokkos have become
essential for enabling high-performance computing applications to execute
efficiently across different hardware platforms with minimal code changes. In
this direction, this paper presents preliminary time-to-solution results for
two representative scientific computing applications: an N-body simulation and
a structured grid simulation. Both applications used a distributed memory
approach and hardware acceleration through four performance portability
frameworks: Kokkos, OpenMP, RAJA, and OCCA. Experiments conducted on a single
node of the Polaris supercomputer using four NVIDIA A100 GPUs revealed
significant performance variability among frameworks. OCCA demonstrated faster
execution times for small-scale validation problems, likely due to JIT
compilation, however its lack of optimized reduction algorithms may limit
scalability for larger simulations while using its out of the box API. OpenMP
performed poorly in the structured grid simulation most likely due to
inefficiencies in inter-node data synchronization and communication. These
findings highlight the need for further optimization to maximize each
framework's capabilities. Future work will focus on enhancing reduction
algorithms, data communication, memory management, as wells as performing
scalability studies, and a comprehensive statistical analysis to evaluate and
compare framework performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出EPaxos*，它是Egalitarian Paxos的简化且正确版本，有更简单的故障恢复算法并推广了故障阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egalitarian Paxos虽有优势但复杂、规范模糊且有漏洞，需要改进。

Method: 设计更简单的故障恢复算法并严格证明其正确性，推广故障阈值。

Result: 得到了EPaxos*，一个比Egalitarian Paxos更简单且正确的变体。

Conclusion: EPaxos*是Egalitarian Paxos的有效改进，覆盖了最优的故障阈值范围。

Abstract: Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a
distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach
makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for
clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks,
Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows
replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader
allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of
any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any
process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more
than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently
submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in
practical systems.
  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication
protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously
specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos*
-- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical
contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously
proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the
whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1,
2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.

*Matija Bucić,Zhongtian He,Shang-En Huang,Thatchaphol Saranurak*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文设计了在扩张图中寻找短的边不相交路径的高效确定性算法，比之前的算法更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前确定性多项式时间算法仅适用于恒定传导率的扩张图且速度慢，需要更高效算法。

Method: 给出了在广义Hall型条件下超图完美匹配的近似线性时间算法。

Result: 算法能在特定条件下计算边不相交路径，有不同的路径长度和时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 设计的算法在扩张图中寻找短边不相交路径更高效，改进了之前算法。

Abstract: We design efficient deterministic algorithms for finding short edge-disjoint
paths in expanders. Specifically, given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge expander $G$ of
conductance $\phi$ and minimum degree $\delta$, and a set of pairs
$\{(s_i,t_i)\}_i$ such that each vertex appears in at most $k$ pairs, our
algorithm deterministically computes a set of edge-disjoint paths from $s_i$ to
$t_i$, one for every $i$: (1) each of length at most $18 \log (n)/\phi$ and in
$mn^{1+o(1)}\min\{k, \phi^{-1}\}$ total time, assuming $\phi^3\delta\ge (35\log
n)^3 k$, or (2) each of length at most $n^{o(1)}/\phi$ and in total
$m^{1+o(1)}$ time, assuming $\phi^3 \delta \ge n^{o(1)} k$. Before our work,
deterministic polynomial-time algorithms were known only for expanders with
constant conductance and were significantly slower. To obtain our result, we
give an almost-linear time algorithm for \emph{hypergraph perfect matching}
under generalizations of Hall-type conditions (Haxell 1995), a powerful
framework with applications in various settings, which until now has only
admitted large polynomial-time algorithms (Annamalai 2018).

Motivation: 解决有大小约束的非单调DR - 子模最大化问题。

Method: 提出FastDrSub和FastDrSub++两个近似算法。

Result: FastDrSub近似比0.044，查询复杂度O(n log(k))；FastDrSub++近似比1/4 - ε，查询复杂度(n log k)；实验显示算法在查询复杂度和解决方案质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提算法是该问题首个具有O(n log(k))低复杂度的常数比近似算法，能有效解决相关收益最大化问题。

Abstract: This work studies the non-monotone DR-submodular Maximization over a ground
set of $n$ subject to a size constraint $k$. We propose two approximation
algorithms for solving this problem named FastDrSub and FastDrSub++. FastDrSub
offers an approximation ratio of $0.044$ with query complexity of $O(n
\log(k))$. The second one, FastDrSub++, improves upon it with a ratio of
$1/4-\epsilon$ within query complexity of $(n \log k)$ for an input parameter
$\epsilon >0$. Therefore, our proposed algorithms are the first constant-ratio
approximation algorithms for the problem with the low complexity of $O(n
\log(k))$.
  Additionally, both algorithms are experimentally evaluated and compared
against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in
solving the Revenue Maximization problem with DR-submodular objective function.
The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms significantly
outperform existing approaches in terms of both query complexity and solution
quality.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究从独立同分布均匀随机解中学习n变量k - CNF公式问题，改进样本复杂度并建立信息论下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从独立同分布均匀随机解中学习n变量k - CNF公式（等价于学习有k - 约束的布尔马尔可夫随机场）的问题。

Method: 重新审视Valiant算法。

Result: （1）在Lovász局部引理条件下，从O(log n)样本中精确学习有界子句交集大小的k - CNF；（2）在可满足性阈值附近，从Õ(n^exp(-√k))样本中学习随机k - CNF，显著改进之前O(n^k)的样本复杂度，还建立样本复杂度的信息论下界。

Conclusion: Valiant算法在特定条件下能有效学习k - CNF，且给出了样本复杂度的新结果。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $n$-variables $k$-CNF formula $\Phi$ from
its i.i.d. uniform random solutions, which is equivalent to learning a Boolean
Markov random field (MRF) with $k$-wise hard constraints. Revisiting Valiant's
algorithm (Commun. ACM'84), we show that it can exactly learn (1) $k$-CNFs with
bounded clause intersection size under Lov\'asz local lemma type conditions,
from $O(\log n)$ samples; and (2) random $k$-CNFs near the satisfiability
threshold, from $\widetilde{O}(n^{\exp(-\sqrt{k})})$ samples. These results
significantly improve the previous $O(n^k)$ sample complexity. We further
establish new information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for both
exact and approximate learning from i.i.d. uniform random solutions.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文针对受限相关聚类问题，设计了与前人算法速度相当但近似因子降至(3+ε)的算法，还为仅含友好或敌对约束的实例开发了更简单算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Fischer等人提出的开放问题，降低受限相关聚类问题算法的近似因子。

Method: 主要通过对新的覆盖线性规划进行舍入，舍入步骤是对辅助图应用Pivot算法。

Result: 设计出了$	ilde{O}(n^3)$时间、近似因子为(3+ε)的算法，还为特定实例开发了更简单算法。

Conclusion: 该算法在保持简单性的同时，降低了近似因子，且为特定实例提供了更简单的解决方案。

Abstract: In Constrained Correlation Clustering, the goal is to cluster a complete
signed graph in a way that minimizes the number of negative edges inside
clusters plus the number of positive edges between clusters, while respecting
hard constraints on how to cluster certain friendly or hostile node pairs.
Fischer et al. [FKKT25a] recently developed a $\tilde{O}(n^3)$-time
16-approximation algorithm for this problem. We settle an open question posed
by these authors by designing an algorithm that is equally fast but brings the
approximation factor down to $(3+\varepsilon)$ for arbitrary constant
$\varepsilon > 0$. Although several new algorithmic steps are needed to obtain
our improved approximation, our approach maintains many advantages in terms of
simplicity. In particular, it relies mainly on rounding a (new) covering linear
program, which can be approximated quickly and combinatorially. Furthermore,
the rounding step amounts to applying the very familiar Pivot algorithm to an
auxiliary graph. Finally, we develop much simpler algorithms for instances that
involve only friendly or only hostile constraints.

Motivation: 提升一般和马尔可夫博弈中到CCE的收敛速率。

Method: 基于正规形式博弈中无悔算法的自适应步长技术，通过分阶段方案将其扩展到马尔可夫环境，将策略更新视为针对基于值迭代学习定制的乐观跟随正则化领导者（OFTRL）实例。

Result: 得到的自博弈算法实现了已知最快的马尔可夫博弈中到CCE的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效提升了马尔可夫博弈中到CCE的收敛速率。

Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling
decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated
Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the
convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the
previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper
$\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE
in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on
the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential
gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in
adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games,
and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts
learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an
instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for
value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to
our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.

Motivation: 现实中算法辅助人类决策时面临偏好不一致的挑战，需对此进行研究。

Result: 人类与不一致算法协作比与一致算法协作获得更多效用，还研究了最大化人类福利的算法属性。

Conclusion: 讨论了对算法工具设计者和政策制定者的启示。

Abstract: In many real-life settings, algorithms play the role of assistants, while
humans ultimately make the final decision. Often, algorithms specifically act
as curators, narrowing down a wide range of options into a smaller subset that
the human picks between: consider content recommendation or chatbot responses
to questions with multiple valid answers. Crucially, humans may not know their
own preferences perfectly either, but instead may only have access to a noisy
sampling over preferences. Algorithms can assist humans by curating a smaller
subset of items, but must also face the challenge of misalignment: humans may
have different preferences from each other (and from the algorithm), and the
algorithm may not know the exact preferences of the human they are facing at
any point in time. In this paper, we model and theoretically study such a
setting. Specifically, we show instances where humans benefit by collaborating
with a misaligned algorithm. Surprisingly, we show that humans gain more
utility from a misaligned algorithm (which makes different mistakes) than from
an aligned algorithm. Next, we build on this result by studying what properties
of algorithms maximize human welfare when the goals could be either utilitarian
welfare or ensuring all humans benefit. We conclude by discussing implications
for designers of algorithmic tools and policymakers.

Result: 在三个亚马逊数据集上，VLIF始终优于近期多模态基线，显著增强视觉特征贡献。

Conclusion: VLIF框架能有效提升多模态推荐效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that
incorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to
significant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely
on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or
misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture
salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal
fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should
balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities,
preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper
presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework
that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A
VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided
descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned
representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial
Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals
across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon
datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal
baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的跨域推荐方法在非重叠用户场景面临图谱稀疏、依赖重叠用户和知识未明确分离等挑战，限制有效稳定的知识迁移。

Method: 提出KGBridge框架，包含KG增强的提示编码器和两阶段训练范式，通过关系感知语义控制和对应驱动解缠，分离并平衡域共享和特定域语义。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验显示，KGBridge始终优于最先进的基线方法，在不同图谱稀疏度下保持稳健。

Conclusion: KGBridge能有效缓解知识图谱增强的跨域推荐中的结构不平衡和语义纠缠问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), as structured knowledge bases that organize
relational information across diverse domains, provide a unified semantic
foundation for cross-domain recommendation (CDR). By integrating symbolic
knowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations,
support reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential,
existing KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly
under non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1)
sensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping
users for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between
transferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable
knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt
learning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under
non-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a
KG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft
prompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling
(addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain
pretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer
without user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic
control with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly
separates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby
maintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning
(addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
KGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust
under varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating
structural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain
recommendation.

Result: 得出AP@k的期望和方差，期望建立基线，方差量化随机波动程度。

Conclusion: 期望和方差能为MAP@k提供基线，有助于更可靠地解读观测得分。

Abstract: Recommender systems and information retrieval platforms rely on ranking
algorithms to present the most relevant items to users, thereby improving
engagement and satisfaction. Assessing the quality of these rankings requires
reliable evaluation metrics. Among them, Mean Average Precision at cutoff k
(MAP@k) is widely used, as it accounts for both the relevance of items and
their positions in the list.
  In this paper, the expectation and variance of Average Precision at k (AP@k)
are derived since they can be used as biselines for MAP@k. Here, we covered two
widely used evaluation models: offline and online. The expectation establishes
the baseline, indicating the level of MAP@k that can be achieved by pure
chance. The variance complements this baseline by quantifying the extent of
random fluctuations, enabling a more reliable interpretation of observed
scores.

TL;DR: 提出训练无关的多智能体工作流CudaForge用于CUDA内核生成与优化，在正确性、速度、泛化性和成本上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计CUDA内核成本高、耗时长，现有自动生成方法效率低、开销大且泛化性差。

Method: 采用Coder和Judge两个大语言模型智能体，迭代生成、修正和优化CUDA内核，并集成硬件反馈。

Result: 生成内核正确性达97.6%，比PyTorch基线平均提速1.68倍，在多GPU和多基础模型上泛化性强，成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 多智能体、训练无关的工作流可实现高性价比、可泛化和高性能的CUDA内核优化。

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中的许多评估指标在处理类别不平衡的数据集时准确性较低，需要更合适的评估指标。

Method: 使用特征值熵作为评估指标，给出二分类问题中特征值与常用指标的关系，并估计混淆矩阵。

Result: 通过各种数据示例表明，所提出的评估指标比文献中的黄金标准指标表现更好。

Conclusion: 特征值熵作为评估指标能有效处理类别不平衡问题，是一种更优的选择。

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析最优库存管理对天然气市场均衡价格、供需动态的影响，评估欧盟最低存储阈值的效果。

Method: 引入GasRL模拟器，结合天然气市场校准表示与深度强化学习训练的存储运营商策略模型，测试多种RL算法。

Result: Soft Actor Critic (SAC)在GasRL环境表现优，能实现存储运营商多目标，其诱导的均衡价格动态与现实价格特征匹配；欧盟最低存储阈值对市场抵御供应冲击有积极作用。

Conclusion: GasRL模拟器可有效分析天然气市场库存管理和政策影响，SAC算法适用，最低存储阈值有助于增强市场弹性。

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational
principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,
bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion,
enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently
compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures,
making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data
validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in
complex registration scenarios.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without

framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep
learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to
control and enhance model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的解算子难以泛化到未见的源或边界函数，需要设计能在不同不规则几何形状、源和边界函数上良好泛化的线性偏微分方程解算子。

Method: 受格林函数启发设计Neural Green's Function，从表示问题域的体积点云提取逐点特征，预测解算子的分解，再通过数值积分评估解。

Result: 在MCB数据集的机械零件几何形状稳态热分析中，Neural Green's Function优于现有神经算子，在五个形状类别上平均误差降低13.9%，比需要昂贵网格划分的数值求解器快达350倍。

Conclusion: Neural Green's Function设计合理，对训练中使用的特定函数不敏感，能实现鲁棒高效的泛化，可有效求解线性偏微分方程。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

Conclusion: 结合深度学习预测能力与经典求解器数值严谨性，为解决高维广义特征值问题开创了高效稳健范式。

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Conclusion: 所提基于扩散模型并整合动态人口分布约束的轨迹生成框架有效，能生成高质量轨迹。

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: 保留并适度增加中等简单问题可作为隐式长度正则化，让模型在无显式长度惩罚下实现输出简洁。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

Conclusion: FineXL技术能有效提升个性化图像生成模型自然语言可解释性的准确性

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Result: 在相同实验设置下，模型比SFT和RL - with - SFT模型性能提升超7%，跨数据集和数据集内评估结果一致。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效且具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Result: FGTS - VA算法实现了特定形式的后悔界，在上下文线性老虎机设置中其后悔界与基于UCB的算法匹配。

Conclusion: FGTS - VA算法在上下文多臂老虎机问题中有效，有最优后悔界。

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Result: 使用预测梯度模拟训练过程能重现grokking的延迟泛化和表征学习特征。

Conclusion: 可以通过约束优化理解后记忆学习，所提出的方法能有效解释grokking现象。

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Conclusion: 该方法对数据有限的分层贝叶斯模型分析有重要意义，可为神经MCMC设计提供参考。

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Motivation: ALS现有治疗效果有限，患者反应差异大需个性化护理，但研究受小异质队列、稀疏纵向数据和缺乏有意义患者集群定义等因素阻碍，现有聚类方法有限。

Method: 提出用疾病进展声明分数对序列进行聚类的方法，整合医学专业知识，研究多种距离度量方法，结合现成距离和弱监督学习方法，将距离与聚类方法配对并与现有技术进行基准测试。

Result: 在353名ALS患者数据集上，该方法在生存分析中优于现有方法，轮廓分数相当，学习到的距离增强了结果对医学专家的相关性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的聚类方法有效，可为ALS患者个性化护理研究提供帮助。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Motivation: 传统机器学习预测器依赖特定气体相关特征，耗时且限制可扩展性，需要高效高通量筛选来识别COFs最佳结构。

Method: 提出COFAP框架，通过深度学习提取多模态结构和化学特征，利用跨模态注意力机制融合特征，无需亨利系数或吸附热。

Result: COFAP在hypoCOFs数据集上超越先前方法，发现高性能COFs分离集中在窄孔径和表面积范围，开发了可调整权重的优先级方案。

Conclusion: COFAP效率和准确性高，可直接部署在晶体多孔材料中。

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Motivation: 标准循环神经网络（包括LSTM）难以建模长距离依赖，尤其是含噪声或误导信息的序列。

Method: 提出Output - Conditioned Gating原则，使模型能基于自身过去推断调节内部记忆门，构建EchoLSTM并集成注意力机制。

Result: 在Distractor Signal Task中准确率达69.0%，超LSTM基线33个百分点；在ListOps基准测试中性能与现代Transformer模型相当，参数效率超5倍；Trigger Sensitivity Test表明自反思机制使内存系统更稳健。

Conclusion: EchoLSTM模型有效，能增强记忆保留，其自反思机制带来更稳健的内存系统。

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法MeZO在微调大语言模型时因维度诅咒收敛慢。

Result: 证明ConMeZO与MeZO有相同最坏情况收敛率，实证中微调大语言模型时比MeZO快达2倍。

Conclusion: ConMeZO能加速收敛，同时保留零阶方法低内存占用优点。

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Result: NeuroClean去除多种常见伪影，在运动任务中优化的多项逻辑回归模型准确率超97%，原始数据为74%。

Conclusion: NeuroClean是有前景的管道和工作流，可用于未来研究提升机器学习管道泛化性和性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 批量 - 边界分解框架有助于理解深度神经网络的训练动态。

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Method: 提出RobustFSM，一种对各种实际客户攻击具有鲁棒性的联邦子模最大化解决方案。

Result: 使用真实数据集的实证评估表明，在攻击严重时，RobustFSM的解质量大幅超过传统联邦算法，提升程度取决于数据集和攻击场景，最高可达200%。

Conclusion: RobustFSM在联邦子模最大化中能有效应对客户攻击，提升解决方案质量。

Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine
learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an
extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are
locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

Conclusion: TapOut是一种在线、免训练、即插即用的动态推测策略选择算法，能有效提高推测解码的加速效果。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Result: QEGM比基线模型（GAN、VAE、Diffusion）最多降低50%尾部KL散度，提高罕见事件召回率和覆盖校准。

Conclusion: QEGM是一种有原则的罕见事件预测方法，比纯经典方法更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Conclusion: 涌现式失调源于不同窄任务发现相同的共享参数方向，有害行为可能存在于权重空间特定可预测区域，有望推动参数空间可解释性和基于权重干预的研究。

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Conclusion: 确定持续学习环境核心容量限制，提供增强自适应正则化的可行见解。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Result: Flashlight生成的内核性能与FlexAttention相当或更优，同时具备原生PyTorch代码的灵活性。

Conclusion: Flashlight能让开发者在不牺牲性能的情况下快速探索新的注意力模型。

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究微调大语言模型进行分类时，给每个标签附加简要解释是否能得到更好的模型。

Method: 沿自然度、全面性和话题相关性三个维度评估对话响应质量，用多LLM集成生成的数据微调70亿参数模型，在六个不同对话数据集上测试。

Result: 在18个数据集和任务设置中，标签加解释训练优于仅标签基线；随机标记虽无语义，但仍能提高准确率，缩小与真实解释的差距。

Conclusion: 解释增强微调（包括真实理由或构造的随机标记序列）能提高大语言模型分类的准确性和可靠性，表明标记级支架在推理时对计算有影响。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

TL;DR: 提出多流注意力深度学习框架用于步态分析，发现数据集中的偏差并提出传感器协同假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有步态分析模型易受数据集偏差影响，且传感器优化存在挑战。

Method: 提出多流注意力深度学习框架，作为传感器优化器和数据审计器，应用于多队列步态数据集。

Result: 模型注意力机制发现数据集中严重的偏差，如在OA和CVA筛查中对右脚过度关注；提出新的传感器协同假设。

Conclusion: 可解释框架能自动审计数据集完整性。

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Method: 使用一种算法从目标及其子实例的底层分布估计实例的最优目标函数值，基于不等式用与最优条件的预期总偏差作为损失函数进行估计器训练。

Result: 未提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 未提及具体结论。

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

TL;DR: 提出One - Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT)加速MDLMs解码，在多个数据集取得更好的准确率 - 吞吐量权衡，为扩散解码创新提供机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MDLMs解码通常为固定步骤和顺序解掩码，Fast - dLLM使用静态全局置信阈值实现并行解码，但存在块和步骤级的置信波动，且同一数据集中输入的置信轨迹相似，需新方法加速解码。

Method: 引入One - Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT)，在单个序列上校准阈值并应用于后续输入。

Result: 在GPQA、GSM8K和HumanEval上，OSDT取得更好的准确率 - 吞吐量权衡，如GSM8K在最佳准确率下每秒处理令牌数增加24%等。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明可利用可复用的任务级置信特征，为扩散解码的算法和系统创新提供更广泛机会。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

Conclusion: 提出的方法得到基于物理的损失函数，梯度与有效配置更匹配，与架构无关且计算高效，还能自然尊重物理对称性。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

Result: 在一系列数据集上评估，新方法性能与CCS相似，且避免了对随机初始化的敏感性问题。

Conclusion: 相对化对比度一致性不仅提升了对CCS的理解，还为更广泛的探测和机制可解释性方法开辟了途径。

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Method: 提出基于离散和连续随机过程的构建块，将世界模型定义为构建块的分层组合，固定因果架构并搜索四个深度参数。

Result: 通过多模态生成建模和从像素规划验证，性能与神经方法竞争且具可解释性。

Conclusion: 若解决可扩展的联合结构 - 参数学习，这些构建块可为世界建模提供基础架构。

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Method: 先应用在线学习适应漂移数据流进行预测，再提出不确定性引导的在线集成方法，利用深度高斯过程近似技术进行不确定性估计并引导元算法。

Result: 在线学习使模型误差比静态模型降低80%，在线集成和不确定性引导的在线集成分别比标准单模型在线学习降低约6%和10%的预测误差。

Conclusion: 在线学习对维持机器学习模型在聚变数据预测中的性能至关重要，不确定性引导的在线集成方法能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Conclusion: 基于统计杠杆得分的方法能有效解决Shapley数据估值计算问题，且在下游决策中有良好表现。

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对地理INRs包含多少信息以及信息集中位置的理解，因此开展对其内在维度的研究。

Method: 分析环境维度在256到512之间的INRs。

Conclusion: 提出一种与架构无关、无需标签的信息含量度量标准，可用于INRs的无监督评估、模型选择和预训练设计。

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

Result: 新损失在处理大噪声方面表现出色，在不同噪声分布下保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: 通过简单改变损失函数可增强机器学习任务的鲁棒性，提供了直观且广泛适用的分析框架。

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in

Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出OmniField框架解决多模态时空学习问题，性能超基线且抗噪强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实实验数据的多模态时空学习面临模态内测量稀疏、不规则、有噪声以及可用模态时空变化的挑战。

Method: 提出连续性感知框架OmniField，利用多模态串扰块架构和迭代跨模态细化，在解码器前对齐信号。

Result: OmniField始终优于八个强大的多模态时空基线，在强模拟传感器噪声下性能接近干净输入水平。

Conclusion: OmniField在多模态时空学习中有效且对损坏测量有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

TL;DR: 提出FIOC - WM框架学习对象及其交互的结构化表示，在模拟基准测试中提升了策略学习的样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数以对象为中心的强化学习方法将状态按单个对象分解，交互是隐式的，需要能学习对象及其交互结构化表示的方法。

Method: 引入FIOC - WM框架，利用预训练视觉编码器从像素中学习以对象为中心的潜在变量和交互结构，将任务分解为可组合的交互原语，并训练分层策略。

Result: 在模拟机器人和具身AI基准测试中，FIOC - WM比基于世界模型的基线方法提高了策略学习的样本效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 显式、模块化的交互学习对鲁棒控制至关重要。

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

<details>

Motivation: MoE架构在自回归生成时进入内存受限状态，延迟受激活专家数量影响，需降低延迟。

Method: 引入动态重路由框架，采用批处理感知路由，让令牌搭载已加载到内存的专家。

Result: 在Qwen3 - 30B和Qwen3 - 235B模型上，批大小为16时，无显著精度损失，分别降低39%和15%的MoE层解码延迟。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效降低MoE架构解码延迟，且不影响精度。

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Method: 提出一个框架，调整SWIM算法中的比例因子，使早期隐藏层捕捉低频分量，后期隐藏层表示高频分量。

Result: 在一维回归任务和MNIST分类任务的数值实验中，提出的方法优于传统初始化算法。

Conclusion: 明确了内在光谱特性在神经网络学习中的重要性，得到了一种提高训练性能的有效参数初始化策略。

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Conclusion: 通过研究Hölder光滑函数在线学习，设计的算法和方法在在线和离线优化中表现良好，具有适应性和通用性。

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能适应多种观测场景，有效解决未知动力学状态估计问题。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: 量子核在联邦环境中有应用前景，推动下一代物联网基础设施向可扩展、强大和量子增强智能方向发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Result: 在671B参数MoE模型评估中，吞吐量最高提升21%，每GPU内存使用降低16.5GB，且收敛稳定。

Conclusion: 提供与TransformerEngine和Megatron - LM兼容的即插即用FP8方案，即将开源。

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Conclusion: 顺序细化应成为现代大语言模型推理的默认策略，需要在推理时间优化方面进行范式转变。

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

<details>

Motivation: 头颈部癌症规划困难，IMCT虽有优势但因相对生物效应（RBE）建模慢，现有深度学习和强化学习方法有局限，需要新方法并行调整治疗计划参数。

Method: 提出MARL框架，采用CTDE QMIX骨干网络结合Double DQN、Dueling DQN和循环编码（DRQN）；使用紧凑历史DVH向量作为状态输入，线性动作到值变换，设计分段奖励；采用同步多进程工作系统与PHOENIX TPS接口进行并行优化和加速数据收集。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效探索高维治疗计划参数空间，通过直接与TPS交互生成临床有竞争力的IMCT计划，显著改善危及器官保护。

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Conclusion: 跨领域训练能增强模型对未见领域的泛化能力，还能改善各领域内性能，RoME框架在跨领域MILP求解上有良好效果。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

Method: 设计超网络动态生成预测函数参数，构建犯罪知识图弥合不同犯罪类型语义差距

Result: 在两个犯罪类型无重叠城市上实验，HYSTL优于现有基线

Conclusion: HYSTL是有效的城市犯罪预测框架

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: EvoOOD框架能有效解决动态图分布外泛化问题，从环境演化角度研究该问题是首次尝试。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Result: 在仿真中展示了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提的完全去中心化算法能有效用于未知空间环境的覆盖控制。

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

Conclusion: 提出的基于可行更新的方法可有效解决机器遗忘问题，且能与现有一阶近似遗忘方法结合。

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Motivation: 现有机器学习在医学影像应用中性能提升缺乏统计稳健性，且相关分析未考虑模型欠指定问题。

Method: 扩展统计框架，将欠指定作为额外方差分量纳入模型。

Result: 模拟表明即使适度的种子变异性（约1%）也会大幅增加支持优越性声明所需的证据。

Conclusion: 验证医学影像系统时需要对训练方差进行明确建模。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Motivation: 现有KGE模型如TransE在无界欧几里得空间中存在建模复杂关系的局限性和训练效率问题。

Method: 提出SKGE模型，用可学习的非线性球化层将实体映射到超球面上，将关系解释为平移 - 投影混合变换。

Result: SKGE在多个基准数据集上显著优于TransE，尤其在大规模数据集上。几何约束作为强大的正则化器带来全面性能提升，球面几何创造“固有困难负采样”环境。

Conclusion: 选择流形是基本设计原则，几何先验可作为设计下一代KGE模型的基石。

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Motivation: PDE高保真模拟是计算瓶颈，数据驱动替代模型在训练分布外不可靠。

Method: 引入NOWS策略，利用学习的解算子为Krylov方法生成高质量初始猜测，与现有离散化和求解器基础设施集成。

Result: 学习的初始化一致减少迭代次数和端到端运行时间，计算时间最多减少90%，保留数值算法稳定性和收敛性。

Conclusion: NOWS结合神经算子快速推理和传统求解器严谨性，是加速高保真PDE模拟的实用可靠方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Motivation: 全球AD负担增长，在缺乏先进诊断工具地区，需早期准确检测方法。

Method: 提出BRAINS系统，采用双模块架构，诊断模块用微调大语言模型评估风险，案例检索模块检索相似案例并融合增强理解后推理。

Result: 在真实数据集评估中，BRAINS能有效分类疾病严重程度，识别认知衰退早期迹象。

Conclusion: BRAINS有潜力成为可扩展、可解释的AD早期检测辅助工具，未来有应用前景。

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Method: 提出评估编码器的公式U(phi)，推导非渐近边界，引入V - GIB通过可处理的几何代理统一互信息压缩和曲率正则化。

Conclusion: V - GIB为获得几何连贯、数据高效且符合人类理解结构的表示提供了有原则且可衡量的途径。

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Conclusion: 所提的DRLHQ方法能有效解决CLRP和OCLRP，具有更好性能。

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

Motivation: 研究在单变量随机干预和考虑潜在混杂的干预忠实性假设下，因果结构恢复中虚假阴性率（FNR）的理论保证。

Method: 针对稀疏Erdős–Rényi有向无环图和广义Barabási–Albert图进行理论分析，还进行了模拟实验。

Result: 对于稀疏图，FNR以$O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$的速率集中在均值附近；对于无标度图，当度指数$\gamma > 3$时，偏差宽度为$O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$且趋于零，模拟结果与理论预测相符。

Conclusion: 这些有限维度结果为因果结构恢复提供了首个适应维度、对忠实性鲁棒的保证，挑战了高维和网络异质性必然阻碍准确发现的直觉。

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

Result: 在不同MuJoCo环境和随机种子下，DClamp - PPO始终优于PPO及其变体。

Conclusion: 理论和实证表明，DClamp - PPO能更好避免“错误”方向更新，使重要性比率更接近1。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高企业信用评分的预测可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 在多机构的企业信用评级数据集上评估Omega^2，系统集成CatBoost、LightGBM和XGBoost模型，通过贝叶斯搜索在时间验证下进行优化。

Result: Omega^2在各机构的平均测试AUC超过0.93，能跨评级系统泛化并保持时间一致性。

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和定量学习能为可靠的企业信用风险评估创建透明且达到机构级别的基础。

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGNs存在模式崩溃、模式丢失和训练不稳定等问题，因其目标包含对抗成分，导致模型只能部分覆盖数据流形。

Method: 引入NAIGNs，损失函数结合重建与隐式最大似然估计（IMLE）的非对抗生成目标。

Result: 提高了IGN恢复受损数据的能力，能生成与数据分布紧密匹配的新样本。

Conclusion: NAIGNs能隐式学习到数据流形的距离场和基于能量的模型。

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

Motivation: 此前统计学习基本定理在CPAC框架不成立，近期工作恢复了可计算环境下的类似定理，在此基础上研究CPAC学习与RER类的联系。

Method: 通过理论分析和推理，研究有效VC维、CPAC可学习性与RER类的关系。

Result: 有效VC维在RER类中可在传统值之上取任意值；有效VC维和传统VC维在满足强CPAC学习概念的类中重合；CPAC可学习性可通过包含实现相同样本的RER类来表征；满足唯一识别属性的CPAC可学习类是RER；RER类在非一致CPAC学习概念下可保证不可知可学习性。

Conclusion: 揭示了CPAC学习与RER类的紧密联系，为CPAC学习提供了新的理论结果和表征方式。

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Motivation: Transformer在注意力模块存在时间和内存复杂度高的问题，限制了吞吐量和可扩展性，需要提高推理吞吐量以满足多种任务需求。

Method: 引入Apriel - H1混合大语言模型，通过从预训练推理Transformer增量蒸馏，逐步用线性Mamba块替换不太关键的注意力层；发布不同SSM - MHA比例的变体并分析；对30/50混合变体在推理轨迹监督数据集上进一步微调。

Result: 发布了不同SSM - MHA比例的Apriel - H1 - 15B - Thinker变体，分析了推理性能随Mamba层替换MHA层的变化；30/50混合变体在vLLM环境中部署时推理吞吐量提高2倍多，推理性能仅有极小下降。

Conclusion: 蒸馏的混合SSM - Transformer架构能在不显著降低推理质量的情况下，相比预训练Transformer大幅提高效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities
through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,
transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention
module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which
severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is
critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under
high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with
linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent
computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we
introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer
attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.
These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained
reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing
less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with
different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as
more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant
of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,
achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the
production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning
performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can
deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent
without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

Result: 在非凸和光滑损失函数下，对聚合梯度有宽松假设时，建立了Byrd - NAFL的有限时间收敛保证；实验验证了Byrd - NAFL在收敛速度、准确性和对抗拜占庭攻击策略的弹性方面优于现有基准。

Conclusion: Byrd - NAFL算法在鲁棒联邦学习中有效，且在多方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往未研究KT模型可解释性是否助于教师教学决策，填补此空白。

Method: 先进行模拟研究对比可解释与不可解释KT模型决策效果，再让12名教师依KT模型信息做决策。

Result: 模拟中可解释模型决策达掌握更快；教师认为可解释模型可用性和可信度高，但达掌握所需任务数差异不大。

Conclusion: 模型可解释性与教师决策关系不直接，教师不全依赖KT模型，需更多研究。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Result: 使用校准方法提高了错误标注实例检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 校准模型为工业应用提供了实用有效的错误标注实例检测解决方案。

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Conclusion: 单人演示为多智能体数据提供了可扩展且有效的补充，使合作学习更实用和广泛适用。

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: VecComp适用于高维、以数据为中心的应用，计算高效且对信道损伤鲁棒。

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Conclusion: 现代化、规模合适的VAE结合原则性条件设定和参数高效微调在分子生成中仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Conclusion: 分析了Adam与SGD解的差异，将分析框架扩展到多种自适应梯度方法，为未来优化器设计提供见解。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，每轮隐私暴露降低95.2%，累积降低49%；CINIC - 10数据集上，每轮隐私提升82%，累积提升33%，且能保持或提升精度。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低客户端隐私暴露风险，在小规模和复杂模型中也有效。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

TL;DR: 对大语言模型减法能力进行系统研究，发现减法准确率远低于加法，特定情况易出错，部分技术可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基准测试多关注加法和乘法，减法作为非交换运算受关注少，需系统研究大语言模型的减法能力。

Method: 评估八个预训练大语言模型在加减法问题上的表现，进行探查分析，测试少样本学习和指令调优等技术。

Result: 减法准确率远低于加法，错误集中在a < b的情况，常遗漏负号；少样本提示有一定提升，指令调优模型生成负号准确率接近完美。

Conclusion: 明确了大语言模型减法运算能力的局限性和可恢复性。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习隐私保护方案难抵御攻击者，需新方法保障训练安全与隐私。

Method: 提出FPP方法，通过参与者评估轮次、攻击后恢复训练，采用基于声誉机制减少攻击者参与，创建docker环境与其他方法对比。

Result: 实验显示FPP收敛速度快，恶意参与者进行模型投毒攻击时也能收敛。

Conclusion: FPP能有效保障联邦训练，实现安全聚合与数据隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: TabTune库具有可扩展性和可重复性，利于表格基础模型的应用和研究。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.
However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Motivation: 随着遥感卫星数量和多样性增加，旧卫星数据用于模型训练，（重新）训练支持新卫星成本上升，因此模型对新卫星的泛化能力愈发重要。

Method: 引入GeoCrossBench扩展GeoBench基准并提出新评估协议，开发自监督扩展的ChiViT。

Result: 最佳遥感基础模型在同分布设置中不如通用模型；跨无波段重叠卫星泛化时所有模型性能下降2 - 4倍，ChiViT表现优于DINOv3；测试时有额外波段所有模型性能平均下降5 - 25%；微调模型最后线性层可使各卫星性能较一致。

Conclusion: 公开代码和数据集，鼓励开发更具未来适应性、跨卫星泛化能力更强的遥感模型。

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏中为特定学生 - 任务组合选最优教师需大量试错，成本高。

Method: 提出GRACE分数，衡量学生梯度分布特性，从信息论角度与基于梯度算法的留一法稳定性关联。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH上，GRACE与蒸馏后学生模型性能强相关，选教师训练可提升性能，还能指导蒸馏设计。

Conclusion: GRACE能高效识别适配教师，为蒸馏提供细粒度指导。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

Conclusion: SAPIN模型可通过最小化预测误差和维持稳态发现稳定平衡策略，锁定参数能保持稳定策略。

Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible
learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the
Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel
computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the
morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates
on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local
prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning
mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the
temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned
expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically
migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This
dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information
(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources
(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole
reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture
can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The
network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis
was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while
continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after
achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes
post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks
maintained an average 82% success rate.

<details>

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) is a combinatorial optimisation
problem characterised by multiple weight capacity constraints and a profit
function that combines linear and quadratic profits. We study a stochastic
variant of this problem where profits are considered as random variables. This
problem reflects complex resource allocation problems in real-world scenarios
where randomness is inherent. We model this problem using chance constraints to
capture the stochastic profits. We propose a hybrid approach for this problem,
which combines an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with a local optimisation
strategy inspired by multi-factorial optimisation (MFO). EAs are used for
global search due to their effectiveness in handling large, complex solution
spaces. In the hybrid approach, EA periodically passes interim solutions to the
local optimiser for refinement. The local optimiser applies MFO principles,
which are typically used in multi-tasking problems. The local optimiser models
the local problem as a multi-tasking problem by constructing disjoint search
spaces for each knapsack based on an input solution. For each item, its
assignment across all knapsacks is considered to determine the preferred
knapsack. Items are then divided into disjoint groups corresponding to each
knapsack, allowing each knapsack to be treated as a separate optimisation task.
This structure enables effective application of MFO-based local refinements. We
consider two EAs for the problem, (1+1) EA and ($\mu+\lambda$) EA. We conduct
experiments to explore the effectiveness of these EAs on their own and also
with the proposed local optimiser. Experimental results suggest that hybrid
approaches, particularly those incorporating MFO, perform well on instances
where chance constraints and capacity constraints are tight.

Method: 提出两种方法，一是结合ML、LLMs和NLP技术检测21个Eclipse物联网项目的漏洞问题，二是在1.1万个GitHub问题上微调预训练的BERT MLM用于分类。

Result: 基于BERT NLP特征训练的SVM性能最佳，AUC为0.65；微调的BERT准确率为0.26。

Conclusion: 研究成果为像非物联网系统一样从问题报告中准确检测物联网漏洞奠定了基础。

Abstract: Timely identification of issue reports reflecting software vulnerabilities is
crucial, particularly for Internet-of-Things (IoT) where analysis is slower
than non-IoT systems. While Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) detect vulnerability-indicating issues in non-IoT systems, their IoT use
remains unexplored. We are the first to tackle this problem by proposing two
approaches: (1) combining ML and LLMs with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to detect vulnerability-indicating issues of 21 Eclipse IoT projects
and (2) fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) on 11,000
GitHub issues for classifying \vul. Our best performance belongs to a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) trained on BERT NLP features, achieving an Area Under the
receiver operator characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.65. The fine-tuned BERT
achieves 0.26 accuracy, emphasizing the importance of exposing all data during
training. Our contributions set the stage for accurately detecting IoT
vulnerabilities from issue reports, similar to non-IoT systems.

Result: 实验结果揭示了MT用于LLMs的能力、机会和局限性。

Conclusion: MT是解决LLMs oracle问题的有效方法，可用于识别其错误行为，但也存在一定局限。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing
(NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile
nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the
performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown
that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these
faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.
One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which
necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.
Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this
oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define
relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty
behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This
paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We
conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We
implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments
with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The
results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as
well as its limitations.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field
of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and
controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation
serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects.
This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs
tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on
the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and
further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy
optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving
confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the
best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to
$0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance
Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy
and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$
over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These
results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in
enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate
the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on
confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in
complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study
not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the
application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points
the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence
mechanisms.

Result: 在多个先进LLM上实验，多数LLM有较好审查能力，DeepSeek - R1和GPT - 4.1表现更优，DeepSeek - R1最终胜过GPT - 4.1。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM在保障案例审查中有一定效果，但仍需人类审查员完善LLM给出的审查结果。

Abstract: Assurance cases allow verifying the correct implementation of certain
non-functional requirements of mission-critical systems, including their
safety, security, and reliability. They can be used in the specification of
autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They
aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality,
environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend
to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their
creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious.
Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques,
such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to
enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case
lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task
that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their
acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that
leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process.
Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize
well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM
prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show
that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1
and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately
outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that
human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.

with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose
EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven
development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued
features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly
models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains
multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is
propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development
iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and
show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a
substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by
16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of
dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for
complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing
iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of
base LLMs to better support iterative software development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建软件架构模型耗时，需借助大语言模型从软件架构文档和源代码中提取架构实体以构建模型或建立追溯链接。

Method: 提出ExArch从文档和代码中提取组件名作为简单软件架构模型，ArTEMiS识别文档中架构实体并与模型实体匹配，与SWATTR、TransArC和ArDoCode对比评估。

Result: TransArC性能强但需手动模型，ExArch仅用文档和代码取得相近结果，ArTEMiS与传统方法相当，ArTEMiS和ExArch组合优于无手动模型的最佳基线。

Abstract: Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial
for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture
Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs)
can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is
time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for
extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs
automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two
LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD
and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS
identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with
(manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares
against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC
achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs;
ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS
is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can
successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of
ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs.
Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural
entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR,
making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSE虽有优势，但全面采用受复杂产品、遗留系统等因素限制，需探究这些约束如何影响CSE采用。

Method: 应用并扩展CSE行业就绪模型评估案例，通过专家访谈和叙事综合确定驱动力和障碍。

Result: 提出更新的就绪模型，引入内外反馈层次，区分市场和组织层面约束，指导从业者设定目标。

Conclusion: 虽全面采用CSE不总是可行，但内部改进仍有益，为组织CSE转型提供实证指导。

Abstract: Purpose: Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) promises improved efficiency,
quality, and responsiveness in software-intensive organizations. However, fully
adopting CSE is often constrained by complex products, legacy systems,
organizational inertia, and regulatory requirements. In this paper, we examine
four industrial cases from the automation, automotive, retail, and chemical
sectors to explore how such constraints shape CSE adoption in practice.
Methods: We apply and extend a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model
to assess the current and potential levels of adoption in each case. Through
expert interviews and narrative synthesis, we identify common driving forces
and adoption barriers, including organizational preparedness,
cross-organizational dependencies, and limited customer demand for continuous
delivery. Results: Based on our findings, we propose an updated readiness model
that introduces additional levels of internal and external feedback,
distinguishes market- and organization-facing constraints, and better guides
practitioners in setting realistic CSE adoption goals. Conclusions: Our results
highlight that while full end-to-end CSE adoption may not always be feasible,
meaningful internal improvements are still possible and beneficial. This study
provides empirically grounded guidance for organizations navigating partial or
constrained CSE transformations.

TL;DR: 生成式AI使“氛围编码”成为可能，但也导致软件系统缺乏鲁棒性等，需重新构想软件模型以实现可持续AI驱动软件工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI使原型和工程化软件边界模糊，软件系统缺乏鲁棒性、安全性和可维护性，因此需要重新构想软件模型。

Method: 从AI生成的代码中事后恢复模型，以恢复理解、暴露风险和指导改进。

Result: 模型可作为人类意图、AI生成和系统长期演化之间的中介。

Conclusion: 通过重新构想软件模型，为可持续的AI驱动软件工程提供了途径。

Abstract: Generative AI enables rapid ``vibe coding," where natural language prompts
yield working software systems. While this lowers barriers to software
creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered
software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and
maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software
models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered
post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and
guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent,
AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward
sustainable AI-driven software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动发布说明生成受数据集限制及任务设计不完整阻碍，需系统评估语言模型。

Method: 引入ReleaseEval基准，包含多种编程语言的大量发布说明，支持三种不同输入粒度的任务设置。

Result: 大语言模型在各任务中始终优于传统基线，在tree2sum任务上有显著提升，但在diff2sum任务仍有困难。

Conclusion: 大语言模型善于利用结构化信息，但在从长代码差异中抽象信息方面存在挑战。

Abstract: Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting
frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to
human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this
process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack
of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design
that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking
fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this
gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note
generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories
across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three
levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from
commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and
(3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human
evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional
baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while
still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in
leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting
from long code diffs.

Abstract: Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the
everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and
mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing
studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison
to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent
logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in
software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in
code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of
autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their
strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic
individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a
particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical
Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software
engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants.
We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of
Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance.
Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled
in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and
they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related
technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written
communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in
interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing
work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software
engineers.

Method: 将连续或近连续回归测试用时间有序的构建链形式化，定义任意两个构建间的回归测试窗口，通过构建元组操作表示现有算法并证明形式化的合理性。

Conclusion: 所提出的形式化方法能有效处理现代敏捷实践下的连续回归测试问题，保留了经典情况的语义。

Abstract: Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software
versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once
close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical
regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of
continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a
time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and
the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between
any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression
testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two
builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for
the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly
representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms
of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by
proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.

Motivation: 当前缺乏质量评估工具，对代码变更与MLS质量关系认知不足，前人研究存在局限。

Method: 对3340个开源Python ML项目进行大规模实证研究，引入PyQu工具，结合主题分析。

Result: PyQu工具平均准确率、精确率和召回率达0.84，平均F1分数0.85；发现61种提升软件质量的代码变更，分类为13类，41%为新发现。

Conclusion: 研究为研究人员、从业者、教育者和工具开发者提供重要基础，推动Python ML软件自动化质量评估和最佳实践探索。

Abstract: In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation
and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS),
software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in
complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how
specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack
of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes
and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in
MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of
the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap,
we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML
projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of
code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics
to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and
recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic
analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on
enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on
contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our
study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection
tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners,
educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality
assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.

TL;DR: 本文提出针对债券市场新闻微调的BondBERT模型，对比多个基线模型，发现其在债券市场情绪分析和预测上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情绪模型多基于一般金融或股票新闻数据训练，与债券市场反应不匹配，可能产生误导。

Method: 编译和清理30000篇英国债券市场文章微调BondBERT，使用事件相关性、涨跌准确性分析和LSTM预测与多个基线模型对比。

Result: BondBERT与债券回报正相关，比基线模型有更高一致性和预测准确性，更低归一化RMSE和更高信息系数。

Conclusion: 特定领域的情绪适应能更好捕捉固定收益动态，弥合NLP进展与债券市场分析的差距。

Abstract: Bond markets respond differently to macroeconomic news compared to equity
markets, yet most sentiment models, including FinBERT, are trained primarily on
general financial or equity news data. This mismatch is important because bond
prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making
general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. In this paper,
we introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on
bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component
of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that
integrate with forecasting models. It is a generalisable framework for adapting
transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and
cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018--2025) for training, validation,
and testing. We compare BondBERT's sentiment predictions against FinBERT,
FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy
analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that
BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns,
achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline
models, with lower normalised RMSE and higher information coefficient. These
results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures
fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market
analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经济不确定性增加时准确预测央行政策决策很重要，以往研究多采用静态模型，忽略决策的审议性质。

Method: 构建模仿FOMC集体决策过程的框架，将多个LLM建模为交互代理，通过迭代修正预测，引入潜在变量表示代理信念。

Result: 基于辩论的方法在预测准确性上显著优于基于标准LLM的基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能洞察个体观点和社会影响如何塑造集体政策预测。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of
the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid
heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy
texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that
overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel
framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making
process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.
Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction
based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic
indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by
observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus
formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable
representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we
theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input
information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this
debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines
in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides
insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective
policy forecasts.

Conclusion: ABIDES - MARL为现实市场的均衡和战略适应分析提供可重现基础，有助于构建金融领域具有经济可解释性的智能体AI系统。

Abstract: We present ABIDES-MARL, a framework that combines a new multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology with a new realistic limit-order-book
(LOB) simulation system to study equilibrium behavior in complex financial
market games. The system extends ABIDES-Gym by decoupling state collection from
kernel interruption, enabling synchronized learning and decision-making for
multiple adaptive agents while maintaining compatibility with standard RL
libraries. It preserves key market features such as price-time priority and
discrete tick sizes. Methodologically, we use MARL to approximate
equilibrium-like behavior in multi-period trading games with a finite number of
heterogeneous agents-an informed trader, a liquidity trader, noise traders, and
competing market makers-all with individual price impacts. This setting bridges
optimal execution and market microstructure by embedding the liquidity trader's
optimization problem within a strategic trading environment. We validate the
approach by solving an extended Kyle model within the simulation system,
recovering the gradual price discovery phenomenon. We then extend the analysis
to a liquidity trader's problem where market liquidity arises endogenously and
show that, at equilibrium, execution strategies shape market-maker behavior and
price dynamics. ABIDES-MARL provides a reproducible foundation for analyzing
equilibrium and strategic adaptation in realistic markets and contributes
toward building economically interpretable agentic AI systems for finance.

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process framework for learning interaction kernels in
multi-species interacting particle systems from trajectory data. Such systems
provide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic
interaction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier
work established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for
single-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with
alignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces
new challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across
species, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such
as predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning
problem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical
guarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels,
provides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of
posterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species
theory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its
advantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete
statistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in
multi-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of
connecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior.

Result: DoFlow在合成数据集和真实世界数据集上实现准确观测预测、因果预测和有效异常检测。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于统一复杂动力系统的因果推理和生成建模。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational
predictions but also causal forecasting under interventional and counterfactual
queries in multivariate systems. We present DoFlow, a flow based generative
model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and
interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural
encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also
provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions.
Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future
trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic
datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment
time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational
forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual
queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the
broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: This paper studies the high-dimensional scaling limits of online stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) for single-layer networks. Building on the seminal work
of Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits
of SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on
the critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the
effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical
scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this
regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the
effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain
conditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls
sample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling
limit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning
dynamics.

Conclusion: 新的马尔可夫随机场类具有一定理论性质，验证了新模型的有效性。

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields
(MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs
sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how
to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random
fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we
introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting
new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the
new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of
computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling
using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties
close to classical MRFs.

Abstract: Concept drift and label scarcity are two critical challenges limiting the
robustness of predictive models in dynamic industrial environments. Existing
drift detection methods often assume global shifts and rely on dense
supervision, making them ill-suited for regression tasks with local drifts and
limited labels. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling framework that
combines residual-based exploration and exploitation with EWMA monitoring to
efficiently detect local concept drift under labeling budget constraints.
Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and a case study on electricity
market demonstrate superior performance in label efficiency and drift detection
accuracy.

Abstract: Kernel discrepancies are a powerful tool for analyzing worst-case errors in
quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such
discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of
kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of
size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to
general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples
from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional
setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known
density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore
the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its
$L_\infty$ counterpart.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Conclusion: iFlyBot - VLA模型框架有效，能在相关任务中取得良好效果，开源数据集可支持社区未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前应变估计技术需大量人工干预和专业知识，效率低且资源消耗大，需要更自动化的方法用于监测。

Method: 引入autoStrain管道，对比基于RAFT光流模型的TeeFlow和基于CoTracker点轨迹模型的TeeTracker，利用模拟管道SIMUS生成合成TEE数据集训练和评估模型。

Result: TeeTracker在运动估计中平均距离误差为0.65mm，autoStrain管道的SLS估计与临床参考平均差异为1.09%，模拟缺血可提高模型量化异常变形的准确性。

Conclusion: 将人工智能驱动的运动估计与TEE结合可显著提高临床心脏功能评估的精度和效率。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效解决现有多模态融合方法的问题，提升诊断性能

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Motivation: 猫和人类眼部解剖结构不同，其下游视觉表征的体现尚不明确，需量化猫-人跨物种表征对齐情况。

Method: 提出统一的冻结编码器基准，使用层中心核对齐和表征相似性分析等方法，对多种网络模型进行测试。

Result: 在各模型中，DINO ViT - B/16对齐程度最高，监督ViTs在CKA上有竞争力但几何对应较弱，CNNs和窗口变压器表现较差。

Conclusion: 自监督与ViT归纳偏置结合产生的表征几何能更好对齐猫和人类视觉系统，为跨物种视觉计算提供可测试的神经科学假设。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

Result: 相比传统方法，平均仅牺牲7%准确率，每秒生成一个重建视频且无需再训练。

Conclusion: VCFlow是快速且具临床可扩展性的解决方案，代码将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: TAUE消除了昂贵的训练和数据集需求，解锁了新的下游应用，为更易访问和可控的生成工作流铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Conclusion: LLEXICORP为更透明的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来大脑状态是神经影像学的核心挑战，对研究神经退行性疾病有重要意义，现有方法多预测认知分数或临床结果，本文旨在进行纵向MRI图像到图像预测。

Method: 在两个纵向队列（ADNI和AIBL）上实现并评估五种深度学习架构（UNet、U2 - Net、UNETR、Time - Embedding UNet和ODE - UNet），用指标比较预测的随访MRI和实际扫描结果。

Result: 最佳模型实现高保真预测，所有模型能很好地泛化到独立外部数据集，展现出强大的跨队列性能。

Conclusion: 深度学习可在体素级可靠预测特定参与者的大脑MRI，为个体化预后提供新机会。

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Motivation: 准确预测端到端网络延迟对实时边缘计算应用的可靠任务卸载至关重要。

Method: 引入基于合理建模的轻量级延迟预测方案，利用帧大小、到达率和链路利用率等特征，无需主动探测。

Result: 通过大量实验和5折交叉验证，达到了最先进的预测精度（MAE = 0.0115, R² = 0.9847），推理时间有竞争力。

eliminating the need for intrusive active probing. The model achieves
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy through extensive experiments and 5-fold
cross-validation (MAE = 0.0115, R$^2$ = 0.9847) with competitive inference
time, offering a substantial trade-off between precision and efficiency

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出6G智能应具备想象和选择能力，通过反事实动态和世界建模范式重构O - RAN近实时控制，构建WM - MS3M模型，在实际O - RAN轨迹上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义6G智能，解决O - RAN近实时控制问题，实现超越大语言模型的定量预测。

Method: 通过反事实动态和世界建模范式，将物理资源块作为控制输入，结合多尺度结构化状态空间混合与随机潜变量构建WM - MS3M模型，使用基于模型预测控制的交叉熵方法规划器。

Result: 在实际O - RAN轨迹上，WM - MS3M比MS3M减少1.69%的平均绝对误差，参数减少32%，延迟相似；比注意力/混合基线的均方根误差降低35 - 80%，推理速度快2.3 - 4.1倍。

Conclusion: WM - MS3M模型有效，能实现罕见事件模拟和离线策略筛选。

Abstract: We argue that sixth-generation (6G) intelligence is not fluent token
prediction but the capacity to imagine and choose -- to simulate future
scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and act with calibrated uncertainty. We reframe
open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via
counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an
action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if"
forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling
primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as
first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An
agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM)
planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within
data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples
multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic
latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories
and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic
O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with
32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean
squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster
inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.

TL;DR: 提出Continuum服务系统，结合工具感知的KV缓存超时和程序级调度优化多轮代理工作负载的作业完成时间，在真实工作负载上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理式大语言模型应用在工具调用时会打破工作流连续性，给服务系统带来挑战，以往工作存在不足。

Method: 结合工具感知的KV缓存超时和程序级调度，预测工具调用时长，选择性固定KV缓存，采用程序级先来先服务策略。

Result: 在真实代理工作负载上评估，Continuum显著提高平均作业完成时间，在不同硬件设置和DRAM卸载方案下性能良好。

Conclusion: Continuum通过建模工具调用可变性和代理程序连续性，优于现有基线，能优化复杂代理工作流的吞吐量。

Abstract: Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.
These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses
between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,
especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache
eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the
following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem
becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous
works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV
cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of
a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases
per-request latency.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for
multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with
program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic
workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a
time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level
first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves
multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic
workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program
continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on
real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models
shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,
and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading
schemes. Preview code is available at:

TL;DR: 文章指出机器学习力场准确学习非共价相互作用存在挑战，提出Δ - sGDML方法，在多种体系上表现优于单一全局模型，能恢复可靠的非共价物理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确学习非共价相互作用并将其与共价力结合是机器学习力场的核心挑战，特别是使用库仑矩阵描述符的全局模型存在问题。

Method: 引入Δ - sGDML方法，在sGDML框架内明确分离分子内和分子间物理，通过训练特定片段模型和专用结合模型并在推理时组合。

Result: 在多种体系中，Δ - sGDML比单一全局模型有一致提升，片段解析力误差最多降低75%，且不损失能量精度；分子动力学模拟表明Δ - 模型对C₆₀@buckycatcher产生可靠力场，在宽温度范围稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法为统一每个片段的误差和恢复全局机器学习力场中可靠的非共价物理提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding,
ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent
phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them
alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force
fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use
Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in
multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly
covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular
features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To
address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation
within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular
physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding
model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest
complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water,
and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a
single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to
\textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics
simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force
field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide
range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses
stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize
per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

TL;DR: 现有基于流匹配的多模态大语言模型在图像编辑有局限，提出LGCC框架解决问题，提升效果与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有如BAGEL等基于流匹配的多模态大语言模型在图像编辑中存在细节退化、内容不一致和效率低等问题。

Method: 提出LGCC框架，包含局部高斯噪声耦合（LGNC）和内容一致性损失（CCL），并通过课程学习将其与BAGEL预训练模型集成。

Result: 在I2EBench上局部细节得分提高1.60%，总体得分提高0.53%，轻量级编辑加速3 - 5倍，通用编辑加速2倍，只需BAGEL或Flux 40% - 50%的推理时间。

Conclusion: LGCC能保留细节、保持上下文完整性、提高推理速度，是一种不牺牲编辑质量的经济高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow
matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing.
However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail
degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on
random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel
framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and
Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling
target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled
pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image
modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with
the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce
inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall
scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x
for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL
or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain
contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient
solution without compromising editing quality.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to
compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By
tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits
and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of
regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a
first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be
more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size
$O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced
as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a
fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows
us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local
version of the star-mesh transformation.

Motivation: 当前诊断罕见病时，将变异基因与非结构化临床描述证据关联仍需临床医生手动处理，需要改进方法。

Method: 在AI - MARRVEL基础上引入LA - MARRVEL，提供专家设计的上下文，多次查询大语言模型，用排名投票法聚合部分排名。

Result: 在三个真实队列（BG、DDD、UDN）评估中，LA - MARRVEL在Recall@K上持续优于AI - MARRVEL和现有表型驱动工具，在因果基因初始排名较低的病例上提升显著。

Conclusion: LA - MARRVEL能产生稳定、可解释的基因排名，输出更具可解释性，便于临床审查。

Abstract: Diagnosing rare diseases often requires connecting variant-bearing genes to
evidence that is written as unstructured clinical prose, which the current
established pipelines still leave for clinicians to reconcile manually. To this
end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking
layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered
context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the
resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable,
explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN),
LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established
phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large
gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each
ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates
phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output
more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analyze the general biased adjacent transposition shuffle process, which
is a well-studied Markov chain on the symmetric group $S_n$. In each step, an
adjacent pair of elements $i$ and $j$ are chosen, and then $i$ is placed ahead
of $j$ with probability $p_{ij}$. This Markov chain arises in the study of
self-organizing lists in theoretical computer science, and has close
connections to exclusion processes from statistical physics and probability
theory. Fill (2003) conjectured that for general $p_{ij}$ satisfying $p_{ij}
\ge 1/2$ for all $i<j$ and a simple monotonicity condition, the mixing time is
polynomial. We prove that for any fixed $\varepsilon>0$, as long as $p_{ij}
>1/2+\varepsilon$ for all $i<j$, the mixing time is $\Theta(n^2)$ and exhibits
pre-cutoff. Our key technical result is a form of spatial mixing for the
general biased transposition chain after a suitable burn-in period. In order to
use this for a mixing time bound, we adapt multiscale arguments for mixing
times from the setting of spin systems to the symmetric group.

Conclusion: 训练VLMs生成文本推理链是提升基于VLM的机器人控制精度、可靠性和可解释性的有效且稳健策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions
into the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While
visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally
intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance
Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of
Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology
to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous
pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By
fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial
reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary
Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more
challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that
performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming
the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps
reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically
across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a
textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,
reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control. Our dataset and

Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects
from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple
component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with
vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component

multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose
AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural
and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which
mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based
on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users
preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4%
for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users
to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling
greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI

Result: 在模拟和现实世界的拾取放置任务中，LACY平均提高任务成功率56.46%，实现更稳健的语言 - 动作接地。

Conclusion: LACY框架有效，能提升机器人操作的任务成功率和语言 - 动作接地能力。

Abstract: Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies
on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,
this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper
contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their
behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to
language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent
capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal
representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We
introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such
bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly
trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from
language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying
semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a
self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data
through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby
improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on
pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY
improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust
language-action grounding for robotic manipulation. Project page:

Abstract: Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models
to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid
robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid
teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive
motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid

while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining
real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around
$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We
demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can
collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.
Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy
framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric
vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous
manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible

TL;DR: 提出VFocus框架提升大语言模型生成Verilog代码的功能正确性，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成Verilog代码时保证功能正确性有挑战，现有方法未有效聚焦关键部分。

Method: VFocus框架分三阶段：预排序阶段生成并筛选代码候选；排序阶段模拟测试并聚类；后排序细化阶段挖掘不一致并细化候选。

Result: 在VerilogEval - Human基准测试中，VFocus显著提高了多个推理大语言模型的pass@1正确性。

Conclusion: VFocus在增强复杂硬件设计任务的Verilog代码生成方面有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in generating
Verilog codes, but ensuring functional correctness remains a challenge.
Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to
select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning
on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage
framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM
reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the
\textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through
LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a
\textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the
"reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking
stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated
testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most
consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage},
VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes
reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the
VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1
correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in

Motivation: 分布式AI GPU中，多芯片设计下NUMA导致传统GPU内核调度策略性能不佳，需解决该问题。

Method: 提出Swizzled Head - first Mapping空间感知调度策略，使注意力头与GPU NUMA域对齐以利用片内缓存重用。

Result: 在AMD MI300X架构上，比传统调度技术的最先进注意力算法性能最高提升50%，L2缓存命中率维持在80 - 97%。

Conclusion: NUMA感知调度对下一代分布式GPU实现全效率至关重要，为可扩展AI训练和推理提供方向。

Abstract: The rise of disaggregated AI GPUs has exposed a critical bottleneck in
large-scale attention workloads: non-uniform memory access (NUMA). As
multi-chiplet designs become the norm for scaling compute capabilities, memory
latency and bandwidth vary sharply across compute regions, undermining the
performance of traditional GPU kernel scheduling strategies that assume uniform
memory access. We identify how these NUMA effects distort locality in
multi-head attention (MHA) and present Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a
spatially-aware scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA
domains to exploit intra-chiplet cache reuse. On AMD's MI300X architecture, our
method achieves up to 50% higher performance over state-of-the-art attention
algorithms using conventional scheduling techniques and sustains consistently
high L2 cache hit rates of 80-97%. These results demonstrate that NUMA-aware
scheduling is now fundamental to achieving full efficiency on next-generation
disaggregated GPUs, offering a path forward for scalable AI training and
inference.

TL;DR: 提出BoolSkeleton方法处理布尔网络一致性挑战，经四项任务验证有效，定时预测平均准确率提升超55%，可增强逻辑综合设计一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布尔等价使布尔网络功能相同但结构多样，给涉及布尔网络一致性的任务带来挑战，需解决该问题。

Method: BoolSkeleton方法包括预处理和约简两步。预处理将布尔网络转为布尔依赖图并为节点分配功能相关状态；约简定义同构和异构模式，保留异构模式，约简同构模式，用参数K约束模式扇入大小。

Result: 通过压缩分析、分类、关键路径分析和定时预测四项任务验证了BoolSkeleton的有效性，定时预测平均准确率比原布尔网络提高超55%。

Conclusion: BoolSkeleton有潜力增强逻辑综合中的设计一致性。

Abstract: Boolean equivalence allows Boolean networks with identical functionality to
exhibit diverse graph structures. This gives more room for exploration in logic
optimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency
between Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton,
a novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency
and reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key
steps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is
transformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned
the functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous
patterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous
patterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies,
while homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further
constrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over
the granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness,
we conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network:
compression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing
prediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore,
it improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean
network for the timing prediction task. These experiments underscore the
potential of BoolSkeleton to enhance design consistency in logic synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出SCALD框架用于反馈环下生物网络因果调控关系推断，表现优于现有方法，验证准确性与敏感性，助力发现新调控关系及关键驱动基因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果结构推断方法假设变量间因果关系可用DAG表示，与生物系统中广泛存在反馈环的现实不符，不适用于生物网络推断。

Method: 提出SCALD框架，采用非线性结构方程模型和稳定反馈环条件约束，通过连续优化推断因果调控关系。

Result: SCALD在推断转录调控网络和信号转导网络方面优于现有方法，在识别反馈调节方面有不可替代的优势，通过TF扰动数据分析验证准确性和敏感性，发现新调控关系并经ChIP - seq数据分析确认，推断出结肠炎症到癌症转变的关键驱动基因。

Conclusion: SCALD是一种有效的方法，可用于生物网络因果调控关系推断，助力生物系统研究。

Abstract: Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and
functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on
determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables
rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach
for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure
inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be
represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at
odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,
making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.
In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model
for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a
stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to
infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that
SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional
regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has
irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through
transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the
accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the
discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have
subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by
utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the
transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic
changes within regulatory networks during the process.

TL;DR: 本文提出结合领域知识的贝叶斯潜类框架进行电子健康记录（EHR）表型分析，以哮喘为例展示其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督学习在EHR数据表型发现中忽略临床信息，限制了解释性，需结合领域知识提升临床意义。

Method: 通过信息先验将临床知识融入贝叶斯潜类模型，处理缺失值，对大哮喘EHR队列建模。

Result: 对44,642名成年哮喘患者分析，发现表型分配后验分布呈双峰，确定“未控制T2高”亚表型。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯潜类建模方法支持在无明确表型定义的异质性疾病EHR研究中进行假设生成和队列识别。

Abstract: Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data
has shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard
existing clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a
Bayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates
domain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived
phenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype
informed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.
  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical
knowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide
unsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach
models missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns,
and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with
uncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large
asthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related
features and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing
the data to inform posterior distributions.
  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February
2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior
distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2
inflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil
levels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication
use, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns
suggest an "uncontrolled T2-high" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our
Bayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and
cohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without
well-established phenotype definitions.

Conclusion: CytoNet为研究皮层微结构提供一致框架，支持多方面分析，为神经科学研究铺路。

Abstract: To study how the human brain works, we need to explore the organization of
the cerebral cortex and its detailed cellular architecture. We introduce
CytoNet, a foundation model that encodes high-resolution microscopic image
patches of the cerebral cortex into highly expressive feature representations,
enabling comprehensive brain analyses. CytoNet employs self-supervised learning
using spatial proximity as a powerful training signal, without requiring manual
labelling. The resulting features are anatomically sound and biologically
relevant. They encode general aspects of cortical architecture and unique
brain-specific traits. We demonstrate top-tier performance in tasks such as
cortical area classification, cortical layer segmentation, cell morphology
estimation, and unsupervised brain region mapping. As a foundation model,
CytoNet offers a consistent framework for studying cortical microarchitecture,
supporting analyses of its relationship with other structural and functional
brain features, and paving the way for diverse neuroscientific investigations.

Result: 该方法显著优于经典方法，区域分析显示听觉、额叶和顶叶区域有贡献，跨条件转移表明存在条件不变神经编码。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对大脑中抽象语言表征的理解。

Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for
computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging
studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond
simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri.
However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving
it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across
diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel
architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility
from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal
structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across
acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms
classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights
contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition
transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby
advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和太赫兹UM - MIMO系统信道估计面临高维、观测压缩及混合辐射模式问题，传统方法性能不佳。

Method: 引入基于扩散的即插即用方法DiffPace，用扩散模型基于混合球面和平面波模型捕捉信道分布，利用其作为先验知识，通过求解常微分方程进行推理。

Result: DiffPace在信噪比10dB时归一化均方误差达 - 15dB，推理步骤比现有方案少90%。

Conclusion: DiffPace在毫米波和太赫兹UM - MIMO系统信道估计中能同时提供高估计精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great
promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless
networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss
inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive
multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming
architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral
efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO
systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed
observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and
far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high
carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing
based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot
faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,
leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a
diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a
diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid
spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,
it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM
performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the
number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.
Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,
attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art
schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced
computational efficiency.

Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions
worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel,
consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting
along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce
EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations
from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual
autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based
on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support
meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize
human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained
environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy,
inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze
interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer

Method: 先对多个不同初始参数集进行卡尔曼滤波得到系统输入 - 参数 - 状态估计，再用Kullback - Leibler散度比较后验分布和先验分布，选择散度最小的识别结果。

Result: 该方法能在线性、非线性和有限信息应用中选出表现更好的识别结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监测提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman

input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has
intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the
limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion
or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose
electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and
compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts
reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments
(PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of
propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby
providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability,
this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object
reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach
combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that
infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features.
Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object
geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of
79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded
RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Conclusion: RL辅助感知在下一代无线网络的ISAC中具有实现鲁棒和频谱高效的潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework
for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing
performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance
characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection
under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive
estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on
the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is
formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication
throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between
detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived
closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed
cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability
compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining
competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of
RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation
wireless networks.

Motivation: 传统Hopfield网络联想记忆功能的局部计算原理未完全明晰，需对其局部信息处理进行形式化表征。

Method: 采用部分信息分解（PID）方法分析经典Hopfield网络中单个神经元，将不同输入对输出的贡献分解。

Result: 记忆容量以下时，神经元活动信息以外部模式输入和内部循环输入的高冗余为特征；以冗余为学习目标优化每个神经元，网络记忆容量提升至1.59，远超经典网络。

Conclusion: 冗余最大化可作为联想记忆的新设计原则，为基于信息论目标的新联想记忆模型开辟道路。

Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the
retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the
local computational principles which are required to enable this function
remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information
processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory
- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of
different inputs to an output into unique information from each input,
redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges
from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons
in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the
information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between
the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and
unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and
performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as
an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each
neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more
than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks
and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield
networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new
design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new
associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

Conclusion: 提出的优化策略有效降低成本，且性能优于传统接收器。

Abstract: Neural receivers have shown outstanding performance compared to the
conventional ones but this comes with a high network complexity leading to a
heavy computational cost. This poses significant challenges in their deployment
on hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two
optimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both
uniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word
Quantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network
Quantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses
introduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we
introduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the
memory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters
characterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a
saving of 45\% and 44\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and
its combination with the compression determines a 63.4\% reduction in memory
footprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional
receiver.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable

Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop
cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission
design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission
adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including
numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable
packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the
hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and

### [239] [Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976)
*Yifan F. Zhang,Sarang Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 证明经典和对易泡利哈密顿量的吉布斯态在弱局部退相干下稳定，有局部“解码器”可消除退相干。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究经典和对易泡利哈密顿量的吉布斯态在弱局部退相干下的稳定性，以及其在热稳定量子记忆和扩散模型中的应用。

Method: 进行理论证明。

Result: 证明了吉布斯态在弱局部退相干下稳定，存在局部“解码器”可消除退相干，热稳定量子记忆有非零退相干阈值，扩散模型中数据分布稳定意味着存在高效局部去噪器。

Conclusion: 经典和对易泡利哈密顿量的吉布斯态在弱局部退相干下稳定，相关结果对量子记忆和扩散模型有重要意义。

Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli,
Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the
effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our
conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered
low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal
correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits
critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local
"decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a
critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable
quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as
one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,
stability of data distributions implies the existence of
computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在实际安全关键场景部署存在风险，需要解决以实现可靠部署。

Method: 集成可靠性三支柱，形式化量子特定信任指标，在参数化量子分类器上验证统一信任评估流程。

Result: 揭示不确定性与预测风险的相关性、经典和量子态扰动攻击脆弱性的不对称性以及隐私 - 效用权衡。

Conclusion: 该路线图将可信度作为量子AI的一级设计目标。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling
computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent
probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and
hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent
reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This
research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning
(TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty
quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial
robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)
privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.
We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information
theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,
trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning
channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a
unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,
uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry
in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and
privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This
roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for
quantum AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无线视频传输方案在像素级编码，忽略视频内在语义，需改进。

Method: 提出WVSC - D框架，先将原始视频帧编码为语义帧，在语义层编码；引入参考语义帧替代运动向量；在接收端用DDMFC通过两阶段条件扩散过程生成补偿帧。

Result: 实验结果表明WVSC - D在PSNR方面比DVSC等其他基于DL的方法性能提升约1.8 dB。

Conclusion: WVSC - D框架结合参考帧传输和DDMFC帧补偿，提高了带宽效率，保证了视频传输性能。

Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in
pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this
paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with
decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D,
which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video
transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic
frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,
enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,
to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is
introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding
methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current
semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the
reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth
efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.
Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based
methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.

TL;DR: 提出MammoClean框架用于乳腺数据集标准化和偏差量化，展示数据损坏影响，可构建统一训练语料促进模型泛化，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共乳腺数据集存在数据质量、元数据标准和人群分布的异质性，导致模型泛化性差，阻碍临床应用。

Method: 提出MammoClean框架，对病例选择、图像处理和元数据进行标准化，识别偏差来源。

Result: 应用于三个异质数据集，量化了乳腺密度和异常患病率的分布变化，证明数据损坏会使模型性能下降。

Conclusion: MammoClean为乳腺AI开发提供了可重复的管道，有助于创建跨人群和临床环境公平有效的系统。

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems
for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata
standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This
heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the
generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We
present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias
quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,
image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies
metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive
review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography
datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to
three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify
substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.
Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models
trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation
compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and
mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training
corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain
generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for
bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and
advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across
diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is
publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.

comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model,
achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean
Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing
accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics
including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the
potential of ensemble learning techniques in enhancing material property

Motivation: 改进传统武器目标分配算法在多对多导弹制导中的表现，有效利用拦截器数量优势。

Method: 提出集中策略，构建代表机动目标行为概率预测的虚拟目标轨迹，中段用零努力脱靶量制导，末段用比例导引制导。

Result: 蒙特卡罗模拟表明，当拦截器和目标数量相同时，虚拟目标方法性能与基线直线预测相当或高0 - 4.1%；拦截器数量多于目标时，性能提升5.8 - 14.4%。

Conclusion: 概率虚拟目标能有效利用数量优势，显著提高多对多场景中的拦截概率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using
virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory
predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets
through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a
centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing
probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is
guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse
flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal
interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as
many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by
distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than
pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across
various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)
demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line
prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to
5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable
effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing
interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.

Result: 对特定期权的数值实验表明，当指数Lévy过程具有有限变差时，方法有良好二阶收敛性。

Conclusion: 所提方法适用于二维无限活动指数Lévy模型下欧式期权定价，有较好收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a numerical method for the valuation of European-style options
under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models. Our method extends
the effective approach developed by Wang, Wan & Forsyth (2007) for the
1-dimensional case to the 2-dimensional setting and is applicable for general
L\'evy measures under mild assumptions. A tailored discretization of the
non-local integral term is developed, which can be efficiently evaluated by
means of the fast Fourier transform. For the temporal discretization, the
semi-Lagrangian theta-method is employed in a convenient splitting fashion,
where the diffusion term is treated implicitly and the integral term is handled
explicitly by a fixed-point iteration. Numerical experiments for
put-on-the-average options under Normal Tempered Stable dynamics reveal
favourable second-order convergence of our method whenever the exponential
L\'evy process has finite-variation.

Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and
\emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined
on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n
\subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number
is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the
full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the
corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated
with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are
linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise
correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical
stability.

<details>

Motivation: 开发FW家族新的加速一阶算法，以在紧凸集上最小化平滑凸函数，解决线性收敛的FW算法在强凸优化中的加速问题。

Method: 提出两个算法，一是针对多面体的纯线性优化预言机（LOO）方法，二是结合FW与稀疏投影预言机的混合方案。

Result: 两个算法都有最优的一阶预言机复杂度，第一个算法的LOO复杂度与r/√ε成比例，第二个算法在有限预热阶段后仅需O(1/√ε)次稀疏投影和LOO调用。

Conclusion: 研究结果填补了线性收敛的FW算法在强凸优化中加速的空白，且无需考虑维度因素。

Abstract: We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW)
family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a
focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains
given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical
ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity --
face dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms:
(1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has
optimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite
\emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that
scales with $r/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and
$r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and
(2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g.,
low-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has
optimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both
the ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions). Our results close a
gap on how to accelerate recent advancements in linearly-converging FW
algorithms for strongly convex optimization, without paying the price of the
dimension.

Motivation: 探究基于角色的提示能否提高大语言模型在宏观经济预测任务中的性能。

Method: 使用PersonaHub语料库中的2368个经济学相关角色提示GPT - 4o复制欧洲央行专业预测者调查，对比有角色提示和无角色提示的预测结果以及人类专家小组的预测。

Result: GPT - 4o与人类预测者准确性水平相近；角色描述无明显预测优势；GPT - 4o在样本外数据上能保持有竞争力的预测性能。

Conclusion: GPT - 4o在有相关上下文数据时，即使对样本外宏观经济事件也能实现有竞争力的预测准确性，不同提示产生的预测与人类小组相比具有同质性，可省略角色描述以降低计算成本。

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的查询增强嵌入器存在嵌入延迟高、对部分查询性能不利且未探索多模态环境的问题。

Method: 将训练数据集的查询分为需增强和无需增强两组，引入合成过程生成合适增强内容，实现自适应查询增强。

Result: M - Solomon大幅超越无增强基线，也优于总是增强的基线，嵌入延迟更快。

Conclusion: M - Solomon能自适应决定何时进行查询增强，有效提升性能并降低延迟。

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Method: 开发了自回归多嵌入检索器（AMER），该模型自回归地生成多个查询向量，并使用这些向量从语料库中检索文档。

Result: 在合成向量数据上，AMER能完美捕捉多个目标分布，性能比单嵌入模型高4倍；在真实多答案检索数据集上，相对单嵌入基线分别有4%和21%的提升，在目标文档嵌入相似度较低的子集上增益更大。

Conclusion: 证明了使用多查询向量检索器的潜力，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

Method: 基于Param - 1 - 2.9B，使用精心策划的阿育吠陀数据集进行微调，数据集涵盖英印双语的问答并严格标注。

Result: 在BhashaBench - Ayur基准测试中，超越同规模开源模型，与更大模型相比表现有竞争力或更优。

Conclusion: 在提供可靠、文化适配的专业医学知识AI时，领域适配和高质量监督是必要的。

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出AutoAdv框架用于多轮越狱攻击，在Llama - 3.1 - 8B上成功率高，评估显示当前模型安全机制有漏洞，需多轮防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型易受越狱攻击，多数评估聚焦单轮交互，而实际攻击是多轮对话。

Method: 提出AutoAdv框架，结合模式管理器、温度管理器和两阶段重写策略。

Result: AutoAdv在Llama - 3.1 - 8B上六轮内攻击成功率达95%，比单轮基线提高24%，多轮攻击在各模型上表现优于单轮。

Conclusion: 单轮对话优化的对齐策略在多轮对话中缺乏鲁棒性，需多轮感知防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型常忽略问题文本，导致预测性能受限，需要更好的方法来建模学生知识。

Method: 提出NTKT方法，将知识追踪重构为下一个标记预测任务，用预训练大语言模型处理学生历史和问题内容。

Result: 实验表明NTKT显著提升了性能，在冷启动问题和用户上泛化性更好。

Conclusion: 强调问题内容在知识追踪中的重要性，证明利用大语言模型预训练表示可更有效建模学生学习。

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Motivation: 大语言模型规模大，存储和处理受限，微调版本存储仍是挑战，且研究表明微调主要影响小部分参数，因此需要高效存储微调模型。

Method: 利用微调更新低秩和稀疏的特性，提出最优奇异损伤方法，选择性地对低秩近似更新进行稀疏化，保留最有影响的组件。

Result: 通过大量实验表明，在相同内存预算下，提出的方法比单独使用低秩近似或稀疏化有显著的存储效率和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的最优奇异损伤方法能有效解决预训练模型微调后参数更新的存储问题，提高存储效率和准确率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Motivation: 探究低资源语言国家因大语言模型在低资源语言表现差，导致 AI 效用降低从而减缓 AI 采用的情况。

Method: 使用加权回归模型，将语言因素从社会经济和人口因素中分离出来。

Result: 低资源语言国家的 AI 用户占比相对于基线大约低 20%。

Conclusion: 语言可及性是 AI 公平扩散的一个重要且独立的障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

TL;DR: 提出MemSearcher工作流和multi - context GRPO框架优化搜索代理，在多基准测试中取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 典型搜索代理在信息完整性和计算成本间存在权衡，限制了可扩展性，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出MemSearcher迭代维护紧凑内存，结合当前轮次；引入multi - context GRPO端到端强化学习框架优化工作流。

Result: MemSearcher在七个公共基准测试中比强基线有显著改进，3B模型表现优于7B基线。

Conclusion: 平衡信息完整性和效率可实现更高准确性和更低计算开销。

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估多依赖上下文检索，仅为长上下文任务一种类型，需新评估方式。

Method: 引入Oolong基准，分Oolong - synth和Oolong - real任务集，要求模型对大量示例推理、执行分类和计数等。

Result: 前沿模型如GPT - 5等在128K下两任务集准确率均低于50%。

Conclusion: 发布Oolong数据和评估工具，促进可处理大量文本推理模型发展。

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Abstract: The Lasso has been widely used as a method for variable selection, valued for
its simplicity and empirical performance. However, Lasso's selection stability
deteriorates in the presence of correlated predictors. Several approaches have
been developed to mitigate this limitation. In this paper, we provide a brief
review of existing approaches, highlighting their limitations. We then propose
a simple technique to improve the selection stability of Lasso by integrating a
weighting scheme into the Lasso penalty function, where the weights are defined
as an increasing function of a correlation-adjusted ranking that reflects the
predictive power of predictors. Empirical evaluations on both simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Additional
numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
stabilizing other regularization-based selection methods, indicating its
potential as a general-purpose solution.

Abstract: Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in
modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality,
source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we
revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field
(MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and
privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with
inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss
function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational
and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate
our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets
from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global
representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship
detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight
a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional
settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and
multi-institutional integration.

Conclusion: 引入软约束的方法是创建对称感知机器学习模型的有效替代方案，能提升性能且对现有模型改动小。

Abstract: Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing
functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness,
data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However,
building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be
difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world
experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of
finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an
alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We
introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of
added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact
symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the
model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group
theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet
tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of
the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring
negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Human mobility generation in disaster scenarios plays a vital role in
resource allocation, emergency response, and rescue coordination. During
disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often
deviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.
However, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or
specific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization
capability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and
unpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior
experience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility
generation that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a
universal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster
types and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose
a unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named
UniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed
prompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common
patterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation
process. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning
framework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through
shared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.
Extensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
an average performance improvement exceeding 13%.

Abstract: When the traded energy and reserve products between zones are co-allocated to
optimize the infrastructure usage, both deterministic and stochastic flows have
to be accounted for on interconnector lines. We focus on allocation models,
which guarantee deliverability in the context of the portfolio bidding European
day-ahead market framework, assuming a flow-based description of network
constraints. In such models, as each unit of allocated reserve supply implies
additional cost, it is straightforward to assume that the amount of allocated
reserve is equal to the accepted reserve demand quantity. However, as it is
illustrated by the proposed work, overprocurement of reserves may imply
counterintuitive benefits. Reserve supplies not used for balancing may be used
for congestion management, thus allowing valuable additional flows in the
network.

Abstract: Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where
vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts
are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits
play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported
vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually
creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight
audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically
generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability
descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in
an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a
Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with
the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and
other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world
vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow
baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results
demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort
required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution
provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security
community.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) derive their capabilities from extensive
training on vast corpora of visual and textual data. Empowered by large-scale
parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training
data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs).
Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box
assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data
samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only
expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features
during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we
propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior
knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the
model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the
suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world
knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three
datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies
training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves
performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis
reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial
manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/spmede/KCMP.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique to track AI-generated
content and differentiate it from authentic human creations. While prior work
extensively studies watermarking for autoregressive large language models
(LLMs) and image diffusion models, none address discrete diffusion language
models, which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput. In
this paper, we introduce the first watermarking method for discrete diffusion
models by applying the distribution-preserving Gumbel-max trick at every
diffusion step and seeding the randomness with the sequence index to enable
reliable detection. We experimentally demonstrate that our scheme is reliably
detectable on state-of-the-art diffusion language models and analytically prove
that it is distortion-free with an exponentially decaying probability of false
detection in the token sequence length.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing and learning
from graph-structured (GS) data, facilitating a wide range of services.
Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the
development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS
data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for
image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data
relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate
$\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in
the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure
two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series
of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$
speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers
over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is
provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature.
Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior
efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while
maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型训练中数据中毒带来的风险。

Method: 使用微调的Llama3.1 8B和Qwen3 4B模型，进行针对性中毒攻击。

Result: 微调模型会引入显著偏差，能绕过简单的警报调查器，可使模型忽略特定用户的真阳性警报。

Conclusion: 提出增加应用大语言模型在安全应用中可信度、鲁棒性和降低风险的缓解措施和最佳实践。

Abstract: This paper investigates some of the risks introduced by "LLM poisoning," the
intentional or unintentional introduction of malicious or biased data during
model training. We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a
limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple
LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes
the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we
demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently
dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we
propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness,
robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.

Conclusion: ASTRA框架能有效自主发现、检索和演变攻击策略，实现更高效和自适应的攻击。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing
web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web
ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have
recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak
strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract
valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and
contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient
strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and
modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that
autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve
more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we
design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not
only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes
reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate
and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library
that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on
their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise
guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and
transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,
and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)
of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: 为防御模型权重泄露奠定基础，证明推理服务提供商可低成本实现强保护。

Abstract: As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model
weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker
controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them
within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work
investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and,
more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We
formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification
framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify
the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we
characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference
and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection
framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On
MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with
false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for
adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending
against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can
be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.

Method: 采用简单的k - 中心点聚类算法评估高级高维距离度量的有效性，进行数千次实验。

Result: 尽管经过充分优化，弹性距离均未显著优于欧氏距离，应用于SWAN - SF多元时间序列时，弹性度量实际等同于欧氏距离。

Conclusion: 通过定量和定性证据支持弹性距离在SWAN - SF数据集上无显著优势这一发现。

Abstract: Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open
problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance
measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ
a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of
advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite
thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean
distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic
measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the
multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of
solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct
thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence
supporting this finding.

TL;DR: 本文提出多智能体框架EvoMem，基于双进化记忆机制，在多种规划任务评估中表现良好，凸显记忆对多智能体规划的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体框架中，类人记忆的作用未被充分探索，而理解智能体通过记忆进行协调对自然语言规划至关重要。

Method: 受认知心理学工作记忆模型启发，构建包含三个智能体和两个记忆模块（约束记忆CMem和查询反馈记忆QMem）的EvoMem框架，两个记忆模块在查询结束时重置。

Result: 在旅行规划、会议规划和日历调度等任务评估中，EvoMem表现出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 记忆对增强多智能体规划十分重要。

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

Result: 在四路交叉口仿真中，相比传统方法平均延误降低24.1%，交通违规最多减少29.2%，人类驾驶车辆和联网自动驾驶车辆公平比提升至1.59。

Conclusion: GAT - SAC框架在混合自主交通系统中有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.

Motivation: 了解表情反应这种情感信号在软件开发技术讨论中的传播和影响。

Method: 分析50个流行仓库的2098个GitHub问题和拉取请求中的106743个表情反应，进行统计分析。

Result: 57.4%的讨论有积极情绪，积极情绪级联远多于消极的；发现五种模式，‘即时热情’影响45.6%的项目；有强情绪感染（r=0.679，p<0.001），效应量巨大（d=2.393）。

Conclusion: 表情反应不是单纯装饰，而是塑造软件开发协作成果的积极力量，挑战了技术讨论纯理性的假设。

Abstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate,
but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence
technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across
50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to
understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a
surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive
sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We
identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of
items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical
analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive
effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape
discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical
discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional
signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence
that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping
collaborative outcomes in software development.

user perception of political news. Our results reveal that AI feedback
significantly moderates partisan bias and institutional distrust, surpassing
traditional engagement signals such as likes and shares. These findings
demonstrate the persuasive power of generative AI and suggest a need for design
strategies that balance epistemic influence with user autonomy.

Abstract: We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated

untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in

egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand

post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its
application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research
challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing
grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan
to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated
collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios. SigmaCollab is

Conclusion: 离散化误差分析为超参数调整提供实际指导，可改进采样性能。

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have achieved impressive performance in
data generation across a wide range of applications and benefit from strong
theoretical guarantees. Recently, methods inspired by statistical mechanics, in
particular, Hamiltonian dynamics, have introduced Critically-damped Langevin
Diffusions (CLDs), which define diffusion processes on extended spaces by
coupling the data with auxiliary variables. These approaches, along with their
associated score-matching and sampling procedures, have been shown to
outperform standard diffusion-based samplers numerically. In this paper, we
analyze a generalized dynamic that extends classical CLDs by introducing an
additional hyperparameter controlling the noise applied to the data coordinate,
thereby better exploiting the extended space. We further derive a novel upper
bound on the sampling error of CLD-based generative models in the Wasserstein
metric. This additional hyperparameter influences the smoothness of sample
paths, and our discretization error analysis provides practical guidance for
its tuning, leading to improved sampling performance.

Abstract: Full verification of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has long
been intractable due to challenges including black-box components and complex
real-world environments. Existing tools either provide formal guarantees for
limited types of systems or test the system as a monolith, but no general
framework exists for compositional analysis of learning-enabled CPS using
varied verification techniques over complex real-world environments. This paper
introduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.
Built upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework
supports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,
ranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts
over those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing
arbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal
proofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)
systematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)
automatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level
guarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study
on an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor
fusion. By leveraging manufacturer guarantees for radar and laser sensors and
focusing testing efforts on uncertain conditions, our approach enables stronger
probabilistic guarantees than monolithic testing with the same computational
budget.

Conclusion: AI溢出与传统IT溢出根本不同，理解AI驱动的生产力溢出需考虑劳动力流动和组织背景。

Abstract: Labor mobility is a critical source of technology acquisition for firms. This
paper examines how artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge is disseminated
across firms through labor mobility and identifies the organizational
conditions that facilitate productive spillovers. Using a comprehensive dataset
of over 460 million job records from Revelio Labs (2010 to 2023), we construct
an inter-firm mobility network of AI workers among over 16,000 U.S. companies.
Estimating a Cobb Douglas production function, we find that firms benefit
substantially from the AI investments of other firms from which they hire AI
talents, with productivity spillovers two to three times larger than those
associated with traditional IT after accounting for labor scale. Importantly,
these spillovers are contingent on organizational context: hiring from flatter
and more lean startup method intensive firms generates significant productivity
gains, whereas hiring from firms lacking these traits yields little benefit.
Mechanism tests indicate that "flat and lean" organizations cultivate more
versatile AI generalists who transfer richer knowledge across firms. These
findings reveal that AI spillovers differ fundamentally from traditional IT
spillovers: while IT spillovers primarily arise from scale and process
standardization, AI spillovers critically depend on the experimental and
integrative environments in which AI knowledge is produced. Together, these
results underscore the importance of considering both labor mobility and
organizational context in understanding the full impact of AI-driven
productivity spillovers.

Conclusion: 本研究是将可持续相关因素纳入房地产估值预测模型的关键一步。

Abstract: We evaluate the contributions of ten intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
including ESG (environmental, social, and governance) factors readily available
from website data to individual home sale prices using a P-spline generalized
additive model (GAM). We identify the relative significance of each factor by
evaluating the change in adjusted R^2 value resulting from its removal from the
model. We combine this with information from correlation matrices to identify
the added predictive value of a factor. Based on data from 2022 through 2024
for three major U.S. cities, the GAM consistently achieved higher adjusted R^2
values across all cities (compared to a benchmark generalized linear model) and
identified all factors as statistically significant at the 0.5% level. The
tests revealed that living area and location (latitude, longitude) were the
most significant factors; each independently adds predictive value. The
ESG-related factors exhibited limited significance; two of them each adding
independent predictive value. The elderly/disabled accessibility factor was
much more significant in one retirement-oriented city. In all cities, the
accessibility factor showed moderate correlation with one intrinsic factor.
Despite the granularity of the ESG data, this study also represents a pivotal
step toward integrating sustainability-related factors into predictive models
for real estate valuation.

Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series
Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input
data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation
cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the
state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate
the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase
transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also
demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by
training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another,
as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well
to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring
over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum
phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring
provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using
two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn
and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these
findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable
input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing
array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.

Motivation: 标准脉冲星计时阵列（PTA）分析为每个脉冲星分配固定均匀噪声先验，组合阵列时会引入系统偏差，需改进方法克服此局限。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯建模策略，用高层超参数对噪声先验进行参数化；引入正交重参数化方法消除超参数与物理噪声参数间的相关性；使用i - nessai采样器探索高维参数空间。

Conclusion: 所提方法在处理脉冲星计时阵列噪声建模问题上有效，能提升分析的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency
gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged
by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA
analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can
introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this
limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise
priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the
challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise
parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure
variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal
reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.
We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore
the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a
minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and
SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show
that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly
and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal
reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the
correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes
involved.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) like Large Language Model (LLM) is
increasingly integrated into digital platforms to enhance information access,
deliver personalized experiences, and improve matching efficiency. However,
these algorithmic advancements rely heavily on large-scale user data, creating
a fundamental tension between information assurance-the protection, integrity,
and responsible use of privacy data-and artificial intelligence-the learning
capacity and predictive accuracy of models. We examine this
assurance-intelligence trade-off in the context of LinkedIn, leveraging a
regulatory intervention that suspended the use of user data for model training
in Hong Kong. Using large-scale employment and job posting data from Revelio
Labs and a Difference-in-Differences design, we show that restricting data use
significantly reduced GenAI efficiency, leading to lower matching rates, higher
employee turnover, and heightened labor market frictions. These effects were
especially pronounced for small and fast-growing firms that rely heavily on AI
for talent acquisition. Our findings reveal the unintended efficiency costs of
well-intentioned data governance and highlight that information assurance,
while essential for trust, can undermine intelligence-driven efficiency when
misaligned with AI system design. This study contributes to emerging research
on AI governance and digital platform by theorizing data assurance as an
institutional complement-and potential constraint-to GenAI efficacy in
data-intensive environments.

Result: 制定了临床前操作手册，为开发团队提供可操作指导。

Conclusion: 该手册可加速临床评估，建立各方共享词汇，减少临床AI转化的摩擦，同时谨慎对待有效部署的可解释性。

Abstract: The translation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems into clinical
practice requires bridging fundamental gaps between explainable AI theory,
clinician expectations, and governance requirements. While conceptual
frameworks define what constitutes explainable AI (XAI) and qualitative studies
identify clinician needs, little practical guidance exists for development
teams to prepare AI systems prior to clinical evaluation. We propose two
foundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that
operationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI.
Transparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts
that enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design
encompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable,
predictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these
principles in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician
needs, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements.
This pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams,
accelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared
vocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory
stakeholders. By explicitly scoping what can be built and verified before
clinical deployment, we aim to reduce friction in clinical AI translation while
remaining cautious about what constitutes validated, deployed explainability.

Abstract: In the aftermath of COVID-19, many universities implemented supplementary
"reinforcement" roles to support students in demanding courses. Although the
name for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of
providing structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were
often poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and
integration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of
reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods
and computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective
planning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a
second-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks,
gaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery.
These insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining
targeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided
walkthroughs. Conducted over a single semester, the intervention received
positive student feedback, indicating increased confidence, reduced anxiety,
and improved clarity, particularly in abstract topics such as the pumping lemma
and formal language expressive power comparisons. The findings suggest that
reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs can enhance pedagogical design in
theoretically dense domains and may be adaptable to other cognitively demanding
computer science courses.

Abstract: Low-resource countries represent over 90% of maternal deaths, with Pakistan
among the top four countries contributing nearly half in 2023. Since these
deaths are mostly preventable, large language models (LLMs) can help address
this crisis by automating health communication and risk assessment. However,
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) communication in conservative contexts
often relies on indirect language that obscures meaning, complicating LLM-based
interventions. We conduct a two-stage study in Pakistan: (1) analyzing data
from clinical observations, interviews, and focus groups with clinicians and
patients, and (2) evaluating the interpretive capabilities of five popular LLMs
on this data. Our analysis identifies two axes of communication (referential
domain and expression approach) and shows LLMs struggle with semantic drift,
myths, and polysemy in clinical interactions. We contribute: (1) empirical
themes in SRH communication, (2) a categorization framework for indirect
communication, (3) evaluation of LLM performance, and (4) design
recommendations for culturally-situated SRH communication.

Result: 明确了当前AI系统的局限性，指出其根本原因无法用现有方法解决。

Conclusion: 应在建构主义范式下对教育进行转型，以保持人类智能相对于AI工具的长期优势。

Abstract: The debate over whether "thinking machines" could replace human intellectual
labor has existed in both public and expert discussions since the mid-twentieth
century, when the concept and terminology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) first
emerged. For decades, this idea remained largely theoretical. However, with the
recent advent of Generative AI - particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) -
and the widespread adoption of tools such as ChatGPT, the issue has become a
practical reality. Many fields that rely on human intellectual effort are now
being reshaped by AI tools that both expand human capabilities and challenge
the necessity of certain forms of work once deemed uniquely human but now
easily automated. Education, somewhat unexpectedly, faces a pivotal
responsibility: to devise long-term strategies for cultivating human skills
that will remain relevant in an era of pervasive AI in the intellectual domain.
In this context, we identify the limitations of current AI systems - especially
those rooted in LLM technology - argue that the fundamental causes of these
weaknesses cannot be resolved through existing methods, and propose directions
within the constructivist paradigm for transforming education to preserve the
long-term advantages of human intelligence over AI tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因缺乏人口标准化的跨国使用数据，测量全球AI扩散有挑战，故提出新指标。

Method: 基于微软匿名遥测数据，调整设备访问和移动缩放构建AI用户份额指标，覆盖147个经济体。

Result: 发现AI采用情况差异大，与GDP强相关，低收入国家有潜在需求，重大产品发布后使用量剧增。

Conclusion: 该指标虽依赖微软数据有潜在偏差，但为全球AI扩散提供新视角，可用于数据驱动的AI政策基准评估。

Abstract: Measuring global AI diffusion remains challenging due to a lack of
population-normalized, cross-country usage data. We introduce AI User Share, a
novel indicator that estimates the share of each country's working-age
population actively using AI tools. Built from anonymized Microsoft telemetry
and adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, this metric spans 147
economies and provides consistent, real-time insight into global AI diffusion.
We find wide variation in adoption, with a strong correlation between AI User
Share and GDP. High uptake is concentrated in developed economies, though usage
among internet-connected populations in lower-income countries reveals
substantial latent demand. We also detect sharp increases in usage following
major product launches, such as DeepSeek in early 2025. While the metric's
reliance solely on Microsoft telemetry introduces potential biases related to
this user base, it offers an important new lens into how AI is spreading
globally. AI User Share enables timely benchmarking that can inform data-driven
AI policy.
