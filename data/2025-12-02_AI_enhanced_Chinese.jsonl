While various methods exist, achieving this rotation in-place (i.e., with O(1) auxiliary space) presents a significant algorithmic challenge. The elegant three-reversal algorithm provides a well-known O(1) space solution for one-dimensional arrays. This paper introduces a generalization of this method to N dimensions, resulting in the \"$2^n+1$ reversal algorithm\". This algorithm achieves in-place tensor rotation with O(1) auxiliary space and a time complexity linear in the number of elements. We provide a formal definition for N-dimensional tensor reversal, present the algorithm with detailed pseudocode, and offer a rigorous proof of its correctness, demonstrating that the pattern observed in one dimension ($2^1+1=3$ reversals) and two dimensions ($2^2+1=5$ reversals) holds for any arbitrary number of dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4e09\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230N\u7ef4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa$2^n + 1$\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(1)\u8f85\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u5730\u5f20\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\uff08\u5f20\u91cf\uff09\u539f\u5730\u65cb\u8f6c\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4e09\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4fN\u7ef4\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e09\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230N\u7ef4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa$2^n + 1$\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51faN\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8be6\u7ec6\u4f2a\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(1)\u8f85\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u5730\u5f20\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u6a21\u5f0f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Our main contributions are as follows.\n  1. Fault-Tolerant Flow Family: For any graph $G$ with $(s,t)$-max-flow value $\u03bb$, we construct a family $B$ of $2\u03bb+1$ $(s,t)$-flows such that for every edge $e$, $B$ contains an $(s,t)$-max-flow of $G-e$.\n  2. Max-Flow Sensitivity Oracle: We construct a single as well as dual-edge sensitivity oracle for $(s,t)$-max-flow that requires only $O(\u03bbn)$ space. Given any set $F$ of up to two failing edges, the oracle reports the updated max-flow value in $G-F$ in $O(n)$ time. Additionally, for the single-failure case, the oracle can determine in constant time whether the flow through an edge $x$ changes when another edge $e$ fails.\n  3. Min-Cut Sensitivity Oracle for Dual Failures: Recently, Baswana et al. (ICALP'22) designed an $O(n^2)$-sized oracle for answering $(s,t)$-min-cut size queries under dual edge failures in constant time. We extend this by focusing on graphs with small min-cut values $\u03bb$, and present a more compact oracle of size $O(\u03bbn)$ that answers such min-cut size queries in constant time and reports the corresponding $(s,t)$-min-cut partition in $O(n)$ time.\n  4. Min-Cut Sensitivity Oracle for Multiple Failures: We extend our results to the general case of $k$ edge failures. For any graph with $(s,t)$-min-cut of size $\u03bb$, we construct a $k$-fault-tolerant min-cut oracle with space complexity $O_{\u03bb,k}(n \\log n)$ that answers min-cut size queries in $O_{\u03bb,k}(\\log n)$ time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5272\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bb9\u9519\u6d41\u65cf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6784\u9020\u53ca\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u5728\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5272\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5bb9\u9519\u6d41\u65cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355/\u53cc\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u9020\u542b2\u03bb + 1\u4e2a(s,t)-\u6d41\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u6d41\u65cf\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(\u03bbn)\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cc\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u6700\u5c0f\u5272\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684O(\u03bbn)\u5927\u5c0f\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8ek\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O_\u03bb,k(n log n)\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5272\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6784\u9020\u548c\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5272\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

With the almost-linear time flow algorithm of [CKL+22], this gives almost linear time approximation schemes for edge and vertex connectivity. By setting $\u03b5$ appropriately, this also gives faster exact algorithms for small vertex connectivity.\n  At the heart of these algorithms is a divide-and-conquer technique called \"shrink-wrapping\" for a certain well-conditioned rooted Steiner connectivity problem. Loosely speaking, for a root $r$ and a set of terminals, shrink-wrapping uses flow to certify the connectivity from a root $r$ to some of the terminals, and for the remaining uncertified terminals, generates an $r$-cut where the sink component both (a) contains the sink component of the minimum $(r,t)$-cut for each uncertified terminal $t$ and (b) has size proportional to the number of uncertified terminals.

Experiments on real-world recruitment data and online A/B testing show relative AUC gains of 1.70% (CTR) and 5.97% (CVR), and a 17.29% lift in click-through conversion rate. These improvements reduce dependence on external sourcing channels, enabling an estimated annual cost saving of millions of CNY.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u624d\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u80fd\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eba\u624d\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u62db\u8058\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u62db\u8058\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u8272\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u95e8\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u6349\u62db\u8058\u8005\u89d2\u8272\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aCTR\u7684AUC\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53471.70%\uff0cCVR\u7684AUC\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53475.97%\uff0c\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u63d0\u534717.29%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u624d\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u62db\u8058\u6e20\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u5927\u91cf\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Although efficient sequential algorithms exist for this task, the scale of modern networks requires faster, multicore-ready approaches. To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library.

This paper introduces PORTAL (Platform for Optimization Research, Testing, Analysis, and Learning), a general benchmark generator that provides fine-grained, independent control over basin curvature, conditioning, variable interactions, and surface ruggedness. PORTAL's layered design spans from individual components to block-wise compositions of multi-component landscapes with controllable partial separability and imbalanced block contributions. It offers precise control over the shape of each component in every dimension and direction, and supports diverse transformation patterns through both element-wise and coupling operators with compositional sequencing. All transformations preserve component centers and local quadratic structure, ensuring stability and interpretability. A principled neutralization mechanism prevents unintended component domination caused by exponent or scale disparities, which addresses a key limitation of prior landscape generators. On this foundation, transformations introduce complex landscape characteristics, such as multimodality, asymmetry, and heterogeneous ruggedness, in a controlled and systematic way. PORTAL enables systematic algorithm analysis by supporting both isolation of specific challenges and progressive difficulty scaling. It also facilitates the creation of diverse datasets for meta-algorithmic research, tailored benchmark suite design, and interactive educational use.

To address this, we propose a comprehensive computational framework that enhances both simulation and calibration. First, we develop a modified Sum-of-Exponentials (mSOE) Monte Carlo scheme which hybridizes an exact simulation of the singular kernel near the origin with a multi-factor approximation for the remainder. This method achieves high accuracy, particularly for out-of-the-money options, with an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ computational cost. Second, based on this efficient pricing engine, we then propose a distribution-matching calibration scheme by using Wasserstein distance as the optimization objective. This leverages a minimax formulation against Lipschitz payoffs, which effectively distributes pricing errors and improving robustness. Our numerical results confirm the mSOE scheme's convergence and demonstrate that the calibration algorithm reliably identifies model parameters and generalizes well to path-dependent options, which offers a powerful and generic tool for practical model fitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3arough Bergomi\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542bmSOE\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "rough Bergomi\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1mSOE\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u5947\u5f02\u6838\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u591a\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u7528Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "mSOE\u65b9\u6848\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u671f\u6743\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper aims to derive the convergence rates of the turnpike theorem for optimal feedback functions in stochastic factor models. In these models, optimal feedback functions can be decomposed into two terms: myopic portfolios and excess hedging demands. We obtain convergence rates for myopic portfolios in nonlinear stochastic factor models and for excess hedging demands in quadratic term structure models, where the interest rate is a quadratic function of a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We show that the convergence rates are determined by (i) the decay speed of the price of a zero-coupon bond and (ii) how quickly the investor's utility becomes power-like at high levels of wealth.

The farmer chooses an insurance payoff to minimize a convex distortion risk measure, while the insurer anticipates this best response and selects a premium principle and its parameters to maximize profit net of administrative costs. For the insurer, we adopt three different premium-principle parameterizations: (i) an expected premium with a single risk-loading factor, (ii) a two-parameter distortion premium based on a power transform, and (iii) a fully flexible pricing kernel drawn from the general Choquet integral representation with nondecreasing distortions. For the farmer, we model index payoffs using neural networks and compare solutions under fully connected architectures with those under convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We solve the game using a penalized bilevel programming algorithm that employs a function-value-gap penalty and delivers convergence guarantees without requiring the lower-level objective to be strongly convex. Based on Iowa's soybean yields and high-dimensional PRISM weather data, we find that CNN-based designs yield smoother, less noisy payoffs that reduce basis risk and push insurer profits closer to indemnity insurance levels. Moreover, expanding pricing flexibility from a single loading to a two-parameter distortion premium, and ultimately to a flexible pricing kernel, systematically increases equilibrium profits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5929\u6c14\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u5784\u65ad\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u8d39\u539f\u5219\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CNN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5747\u8861\u5229\u6da6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5929\u6c14\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u7684\u5784\u65ad\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u519c\u6c11\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aBowley\u578b\u5e8f\u8d2f\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4fdd\u8d39\u539f\u5219\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u519c\u6c11\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u6307\u6570\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\u53cc\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "CNN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f7f\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u5229\u6da6\u63a5\u8fd1 indemnity \u4fdd\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u5747\u8861\u5229\u6da6\u3002", "conclusion": "CNN\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u5229\u6da6\u3002"}}

Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b97\u6cd5DAISI\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDAISI\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u660e\u663e\u504f\u79bb\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DAISI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u91c7\u6837\u540c\u5316\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u878d\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDAISI\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5608\u6742\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DAISI\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure in order to select numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u56fd\u5185\u822a\u73ed\u673a\u7968\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7528PDS - LASSO\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f4e\u4ef7\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u65e0\u9009\u5ea7\u8d39\u65f6\u9ad8\u4ef7\u7968\u4e58\u5ba2\u5e38\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u5185\u822a\u73ed\u673a\u7968\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u767b\u673a\u724c\u5fae\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u8bbf\u8c08\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Post - Double - Selection LASSO (PDS - LASSO)\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u65b0\u5ba2\u8231\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u65e0\u9009\u5ea7\u8d39\u65f6\uff0c\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2d\u7968\u7684\u9ad8\u4ef7\u7968\u4e58\u5ba2\u5e38\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u5ea7\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u7968\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5ba2\u8231\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u9879\u4e3b\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u6536\u5165\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u903b\u8f91\u3002"}}

As $N$ grows, its samples become nearly independent, but with an increased computational cost. We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling.

We analyze an $\u03b1$-approximate VCG mechanism and show that truthful reporting becomes a subgame-perfect equilibrium when the immediate penalty exceeds the incentive gap created by approximation, scaled by monitoring accuracy. To validate this result, we construct a PPO-based multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for P2P smart-grid trading, where prosumers incur penalties for bidding far from their true valuations.

However, under a limited number of function evaluations (#FEs), the performance of EAs is quite sensitive to the quality of the initial population. Obtaining a high-quality initial population without problem-specific knowledge remains a significant challenge. To address this, this work proposes a general-purpose population initialization method, named mixture-of-experience for population initialization (MPI), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. MPI leverages solving experiences from previously solved problems to generate high-quality initial populations for new problems using only a small number of FEs. Its main novelty lies in a general-purpose approach for representing, selecting, and transferring solving experiences without requiring problem-specific knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted across six binary optimization problem classes, comprising three classic classes and three complex classes from real-world applications. The experience repository is constructed solely based on instances from the three classic classes, while the performance evaluation is performed across all six classes.

We propose a model-first hybrid architecture for the options \"wheel\" strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with the robustness of a Bayesian Network. Rather than using the LLM as a black-box decision-maker, we employ it as an intelligent model builder. For each trade decision, the LLM constructs a context-specific Bayesian network by interpreting current market conditions, including prices, volatility, trends, and news, and hypothesizing relationships among key variables. The LLM also selects relevant historical data from an 18.75-year, 8,919-trade dataset to populate the network's conditional probability tables. This selection focuses on scenarios analogous to the present context. The instantiated Bayesian network then performs transparent probabilistic inference, producing explicit probability distributions and risk metrics to support decision-making. A feedback loop enables the LLM to analyze trade outcomes and iteratively refine subsequent network structures and data selection, learning from both successes and failures. Empirically, our hybrid system demonstrates effective performance on the wheel strategy. Over nearly 19 years of out-of-sample testing, it achieves a 15.3% annualized return with significantly superior risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio 1.08 versus 0.62 for market benchmarks) and dramatically lower drawdown (-8.2% versus -60%) while maintaining a 0% assignment rate through strategic option rolling.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, current synthetic training data suffers from a critical weakness: the reasoning steps are often plausible-sounding explanations generated by teacher models, not verifiable accounts of what the code actually does. This creates a troubling failure mode where models learn to mimic superficially convincing but logically flawed reasoning patterns.\n  We address this by grounding CoT generation directly in program execution traces. Our pipeline instruments code to capture its dynamic behavior, then narrates these verified execution traces into natural language rationales that are correct by construction. This execution-grounded approach ensures every reasoning step reflects what the program genuinely computes, eliminating logical hallucinations at the source. We evaluate our method on code reasoning tasks (forward reasoning on CruxEval and LiveCodeBench-Exec, backward reasoning on CruxEval-Input), as well as code generation and explanation tasks from HumanEval. Models trained on our bi-directional trace-grounded data achieve substantial improvements, with gains of up to 30 points on output prediction and 28 points on input prediction over base models, alongside improved explanation and code generation, demonstrating that verifiable reasoning fundamentally enhances model capabilities. https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Research-AI/Verified-Code-CoT", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06CoT\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6709\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06CoT\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u63d2\u6869\u6355\u83b7\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534730\u5206\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534728\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases.

This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos.

We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images.

Both belong to the class of tree-based ensemble methods, where predictions are obtained by aggregating many randomized regression trees. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing such methods through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) constructed on tree ensembles -- more precisely, on the random partitions generated by randomized regression trees. We establish fundamental analytical properties of the resulting Random Forest kernel, including boundedness, continuity, and universality, and show that a Random Forest predictor can be characterized as the unique minimizer of a penalized empirical risk functional in this RKHS, providing a variational interpretation of ensemble learning. We further extend this perspective to the continuous-time formulation of Gradient Boosting introduced by Dombry and Duchamps, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a gradient flow on a Hilbert manifold induced by the Random Forest RKHS. A key feature of this framework is that both the kernel and the RKHS geometry are data-dependent, offering a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of tree-based ensembles.

Technically, this paper develops a stochastic model of retirement income within an ELRiS structure that is calibrated to equate the discounted expected utility of a guaranteed national pension. The practical motivation for developing this alternative is that working members of First Nations peoples of Canada: (1) experience much higher mortality rates than average over their entire life cycle, and (2) some are actually allowed by current legislation to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). We then demonstrate that under reasonable economic preferences and parameters, a sub-group with a 10-year life expectancy gap relative to the population could attain equivalent lifetime utility by contributing a mere two-thirds to the plan, even if they were pooled with only 30 members. For a longevity gap of 20 years, such as between an Indigenous male versus a non-Indigenous female, the contribution rate falls to less than a third. The difference between the statutory and mandatory contribution rates to a guaranteed national pension and those needed within these self-sustaining pools is an implicit subsidy from Indigenous to non-Indigenous.

Traditional single-task forecasting models, which focus solely on sales or inventory, often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and cross-task interactions that characterize real-world supply chain dynamics. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Task Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT-MTL) framework designed for joint sales and inventory forecasting within the Amazon e-commerce ecosystem. The model integrates heterogeneous data sources, including historical sales records, warehouse inventory levels, pricing, promotions, and event-driven factors such as holidays and Prime Day campaigns, through a unified deep learning architecture. A shared encoder captures long-term temporal patterns, while task-specific decoder heads predict sales volume, inventory turnover, and stockout probability simultaneously. Experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TFT-MTL model significantly outperforms baseline methods such as LSTM, GRU, and single-task TFT. Compared with the single-task TFT model, the proposed approach achieves a 6.2% reduction in Sales RMSE, a 12.7% decrease in Sales MAPE, a 6.4% reduction in Inventory RMSE, and a 12.4% decrease in Inventory MAPE. These results confirm the model's ability to effectively capture multi-dimensional dependencies across supply chain variables.

Algorithmic tools that can efficiently probe and analyze these cyclic topologies are increasingly vital for tasks in graph mining, network optimization, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. A core primitive for quantitative analysis of cycles is finding the Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC), representing the shortest cyclic path in a weighted graph. However, computing the MWC efficiently remains a challenge, particularly compared to shortest path computations. This paper introduces a novel deterministic algorithm for finding the MWC in general weighted graphs. Our approach adapts the structure of Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing and minimizing a \\textit{composite distance} metric, effectively translating the global cycle search into an iterative node-centric optimization. We provide a rigorous proof of correctness based on loop invariants. We detail two mechanisms for accelerating the search: a provable node discarding technique based on intermediate results, and a highly effective graph pruning heuristic. This heuristic dynamically restricts the search to relevant subgraphs, leveraging the principle of locality often present in complex networks to achieve significant empirical speedups, while periodic resets ensure global optimality is maintained. The efficiency of the proposed MWC algorithm enables its use as a core component in more complex analyses focused on cyclic properties. We illustrate this through a detailed application case study: accelerating the computation of the Loop Modulus, a measure of cycle richness used in advanced network characterization. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the runtime of the iterative constraint-finding bottleneck in this computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u5c0f\u6743\u91cd\u73af\uff08MWC\uff09\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u52a0\u901f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97MWC\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5faa\u73af\u641c\u7d22\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4ee5\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u4e22\u5f03\u6280\u672f\u548c\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MWC\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5faa\u73af\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97Loop Modulus\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ea6\u675f\u67e5\u627e\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3MWC\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Findings offer insight into how generative AI shapes information-seeking processes and contribute to ongoing discussions in information retrieval, human-AI interaction, and technology-supported learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u8ba8\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5851\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e24\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Existing orchestration frameworks optimize single dimensions (Kubernetes prioritizes latency, federated learning preserves privacy, edge computing reduces network distance), creating solutions that struggle under real-world heterogeneity. We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous \"islands\" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud. Our key insights: (1) request-level heterogeneity demands policy-constrained multi-objective optimization, (2) data locality enables routing compute to data rather than data to compute, and (3) typed placeholder sanitization preserves context semantics across trust boundaries. IslandRun introduces agent-based routing, tiered island groups with differential trust, and reversible anonymization.

Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u504f\u597d\u805a\u5408\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6570\u5faa\u73af\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Simple Stable Voting\uff08SSV\uff09\u5728\u6700\u591a6\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u65f6\u662fSplit Cycle\uff08SC\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc76\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u65f6\u5219\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u53cd\u4f8b\u501f\u52a9SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1Holliday\u548cPacuit\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u4e8eSSV\u662fSC\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u591a5\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff0c6\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u548c7\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u501f\u52a9SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u731c\u60f3\u5728\u6700\u591a6\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u65f6\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u8fc76\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u65f6\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684SAT\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u4ed6\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u80dc\u5229\u5e45\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

Measures such as F1-score, AUPRC, MCC, and accuracy induce degenerate thresholds -- converging to zero or one -- and their values become dominated by class imbalance rather than tail discrimination. We develop a family of rare-event-stable (RES) metrics whose optimal thresholds remain strictly interior as the event probability approaches zero, ensuring coherent decision rules under extreme rarity. Simulations spanning event probabilities from 0.01 down to one in a million show that RES metrics maintain stable thresholds, consistent model rankings, and near-complete prevalence invariance, whereas traditional metrics exhibit statistically significant threshold drift and structural collapse. A credit-default application confirms these results: RES metrics yield interpretable probability-of-default cutoffs (4-9%) and remain robust under subsampling, while classical metrics fail operationally.

After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces.

However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.\n  In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \\textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method.

Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide.

We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\\text{Re}\\in\\{10, 15, 20\\}$).

As a first step towards vertical integration of DuckDB and programmable SSDs, we consider whether and how DuckDB can access NVMe SSDs directly. By default, DuckDB relies on the POSIX file interface. In contrast, we rely on the xNVMe library and explore how it can be leveraged in DuckDB. We leverage the block-based nature of the DuckDB buffer manager to bypass the synchronous POSIX I/O interface, the file system and the block manager. Instead, we directly issue asynchronous I/Os against the SSD logical block address space. Our preliminary experimental study compares different ways to manage asynchronous I/Os atop xNVMe. The speed-up we observe over the DuckDB baseline is significant, even for the simplest scan query over a TPC-H table.

Conventional fixed-length and recursive splitters often produce arbitrary, incoherent segments that fail to preserve semantic structure. Although semantic chunking has gained traction, its influence on generation quality remains underexplored. This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMed data using three different embedding models. We further present an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both retrieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA.

The multi-stage setting arises naturally in manufacturing pipelines and distributed computing workflows, when each job must traverse a fixed sequence of processing stages. While the classical makespan price of anarchy of $2 - \\frac{1}{m}$ has been established for sequential scheduling on identical machines, the efficiency loss in multi-stage scheduling has, to the best of our knowledge, not been previously analyzed. We assume that each task follows a greedy strategy and gets assigned to the least-loaded machine upon arrival at each stage. Notably, we observe that in multi-stage environments, greedy behavior generally does not coincide with a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. We continue with analyzing the equilibrium under greedy choices, since it is logical for modeling selfish agents with limited computational power, and may also model a central scheduler performing the common least-load scheduling heuristics. Under this model, we first show that in single-stage scheduling, greedy choice again yields an exact price of anarchy of $2 - \\frac{1}{m}$. In multi-stage scheduling, we show that the completion time from one stage to the next increases by at most two times the maximum job execution time. Using this relationship, we derived the price of anarchy of multistage scheduling under greedy choices to lie within $[2 - \\frac{1}{m}, 3 - \\frac{1}{m}]$, where $m$ denote the maximum number of machines in one stage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u8c03\u5ea6\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8ba8\u8bba\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\u672a\u88ab\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5236\u9020\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a$2 - \frac{1}{m}$\uff0c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5728$[2 - \frac{1}{m}, 3 - \frac{1}{m}]$\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u673a\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u653f\u5e9c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs.

Although large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict program outputs, most prior work has focused on output accuracy and performance, treating reasoning as a black box. As a result, little is known about the structure or failure modes of their reasoning traces. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study on runtime behavior inference with reasoning LLMs, aiming to uncover and characterize errors in their reasoning traces. We curate a benchmark from HumanEval Plus and LiveCodeBench, containing 427 code snippets. For each snippet, we test three input types: regular, edge, and invalid. Twelve input values are selected per snippet, each paired with its ground-truth execution result.

It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \\$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \\emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \\emph{solvency}, \\emph{revenue}, and \\emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \\emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \\$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by approximately $8\\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \\$630 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u52a0\u5bc6\u6c38\u7eed\u671f\u8d27\u81ea\u52a8\u51cf\u4ed3\uff08ADL\uff09\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u5229\u6da6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6c38\u7eed\u671f\u8d27\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9ADL\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaADL\u4e25\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Hyperliquid\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eADL\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u9053\u5fb7\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u4e09\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5e73\u8861\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\uff1bHyperliquid\u751f\u4ea7\u961f\u5217\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528ADL\uff0cBinance\u66f4\u751a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684ADL\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u5229\u6da6\u635f\u5931\u3002"}}

Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing.

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity.

These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors.

Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08OAT\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPEOAT\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eOAT\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08CAT\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165OAT\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPEOAT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u73af\u5883\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PEOAT\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "PEOAT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfCAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support.

PhD Thesis", "summary": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $\u03b5$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches.

Unlike traditional online learners, CodeFlowLM employs continual fine-tuning to address concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency without retraining from scratch. We evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs (notably CodeT5+ and UniXCoder) in JIT-SDP scenarios within and between projects, comparing them with the incremental baseline BORB. The results show that CodeFlowLM achieves up to 68% G-Mean gains, confirming its superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. We further extend the analysis to Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL), benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro against attention-based models. GPT-5 delivers comparable performance for Recall@20% and Effort@20% with higher stability, although attention-based methods retain an advantage in fine-grained ranking metrics (Top-k, IFA). A qualitative error analysis reveals that most false positives arise from (1) human-like conservative bias, (2) insufficient contextual information in diff-based prompts, and (3) potential dataset mislabeling in JIT-Defects4J. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLM reasoning in defect localization. False negatives occur in smaller proportions. Overall, CodeFlowLM significantly advances the state of the art in incremental JIT-SDP, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis of LLMs in JIT-DL not only benchmarks their performance against established attention-based models but also provides critical insights into the current limitations of prompt-based defect reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecdCodeFlowLM\u7528\u4e8eJIT - SDP\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30PLMs\u548cLLMs\u5728JIT - SDP\u548cJIT - DL\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9519\u8bef\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u663e\u793aCodeFlowLM\u4f18\u52bf\u53caLLMs\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3JIT - SDP\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30PLMs\u548cLLMs\u5728JIT - SDP\u548cJIT - DL\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u7684CodeFlowLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30encoder - only\u548cencoder - decoder PLMs\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebfBORB\uff1b\u5728JIT - DL\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4LLMs\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "CodeFlowLM\u5728JIT - SDP\u4e2dG - Mean\u589e\u76ca\u8fbe68%\uff1bGPT - 5\u5728JIT - DL\u7684Recall@20%\u548cEffort@20%\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u6f0f\u62a5\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeFlowLM\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u589e\u91cfJIT - SDP\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9LLMs\u5728JIT - DL\u7684\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This makes automated fact-checking system necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our online media ecosystem. Previous methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of decomposing the claim into simpler sub-tasks and utilizing LLM-based multi agent system to execute them. However, those models faces two limitations: they often fail to verify every component in the claim and lack of structured framework to logically connect the results of sub-tasks for a final prediction. In this work, we propose a novel automated fact-checking framework called Trification. Our framework begins by generating a comprehensive set of verification actions to ensure complete coverage of the claim. It then structured these actions into a dependency graph to model the logical interaction between actions. Furthermore, the graph can be dynamically modified, allowing the system to adapt its verification strategy.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210U - Net\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u9707\u5c42\u4f4d\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fCFA U - Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u590d\u6742\u5730\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e2d\u63d2\u503c\u5c42\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5730\u9707\u5c42\u4f4d\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5148\u8fdbU - Net\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528CFA U - Net\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cSobel\u6d3e\u751f\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7528DBSCAN\u7ec6\u5316\u5408\u5e76\u5c42\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u6cb9\u7530\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1IoU\u8fbe0.881\u3001MAE\u4e3a2.49ms\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u6d77F3\u533a\u5757\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u738797.6%\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5730\u9707\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accepted to ITCS 2026", "summary": "When uncertainty meets costly information gathering, a fundamental question emerges: which data points should we probe to unlock near-optimal solutions? Sparsification of stochastic packing problems addresses this trade-off. The existing notions of sparsification measure the level of sparsity, called degree, as the ratio of queried items to the optimal solution size. While effective for matching and matroid-type problems with uniform structures, this cardinality-based approach fails for knapsack-type constraints where feasible sets exhibit dramatic structural variation. We introduce a polyhedral sparsification framework that measures the degree as the smallest scalar needed to embed the query set within a scaled feasibility polytope, naturally capturing redundancy without relying on cardinality.\n  Our main contribution establishes that knapsack, multiple knapsack, and generalized assignment problems admit (1 - epsilon)-approximate sparsifiers with degree polynomial in 1/p and 1/epsilon -- where p denotes the independent activation probability of each element -- remarkably independent of problem dimensions. The key insight involves grouping items with similar weights and deploying a charging argument: when our query set misses an optimal item, we either substitute it with a queried item from the same group or leverage that group's excess contribution to compensate for the loss. This reveals an intriguing complexity-theoretic separation -- while the multiple knapsack problem lacks an FPTAS and generalized assignment is APX-hard, their sparsification counterparts admit efficient (1 - epsilon)-approximation algorithms that identify polynomial-degree query sets. Finally, we raise an open question: can such sparsification extend to general integer linear programs with degree independent of problem dimensions?", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u6253\u5305\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728(1 - epsilon)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u80cc\u5305\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u6253\u5305\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u67e5\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6743\u91cd\u7269\u54c1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u6536\u8d39\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u80cc\u5305\u3001\u591a\u80cc\u5305\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728(1 - epsilon)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5ea6\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u9ad8\u6548(1 - epsilon)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u5426\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%.

To address these issues, we developed ng-reactive-lint, a deterministic static analysis tool that understands Angular's component semantics, lifecycle hooks, template bindings, and reactivity patterns. Unlike generic ESLint or RxJS plugins, ng-reactive-lint performs framework-aware analysis to detect high-impact anti-patterns and provide actionable, context-specific fixes.

However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse.

In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations.

Second, for both the difference of sample means and the unbiased $\\widehat{\\mathrm{MMD}}^{2}$ estimator, we derive closed-form one-swap increment identities whose conditional variances scale as $O(h^{2})$, in contrast to the $\u0398(h)$ increment variability under full relabeling. This increment-level variance contraction sharpens the Bernstein--Freedman variance proxy and leads to substantially smaller permutation critical values. Third, we obtain explicit, data-dependent expressions for the resulting critical values and statistical power. Together, these results show that block-restricted one-swap permutations can achieve strictly higher power than classical full permutation tests while maintaining exact finite-sample validity, without relying on pessimistic worst-case Lipschitz bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Motivated by practices on leading e-commerce platforms, we analyze a sequential duopolistic newsvendor game where retailers first publicly set prices and subsequently make private inventory decisions under demand uncertainty. Our theory predicts that higher profit margins and demand uncertainty intensify price competition, while optimal inventory responses to demand uncertainty are shaped by profit margins. Laboratory evidence, however, reveals that participants are generally reluctant to compete on price, frequently coordinating on salient focal (reserve) prices, particularly in low-margin settings, and show little sensitivity to demand uncertainty in pricing. On the inventory side, participants' order quantities are largely insensitive to chosen prices and continue to exhibit well-documented Pull-to-Center biases. These findings reveal a disconnect between pricing and inventory decisions under competition and highlight the importance of accounting for persistent behavioral tendencies in retail operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u7ade\u4e89\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8003\u8651\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u5546\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u6269\u5f20\u4f7f\u7ade\u4e89\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u534f\u8c03\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u6218\u7565\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d7\u9886\u5148\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u8df5\u542f\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u987a\u5e8f\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u65b0\u95fb\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u5148\u516c\u5f00\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u540e\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u505a\u79c1\u4eba\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u5267\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u53d7\u5229\u6da6\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0d\u613f\u4ef7\u683c\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5e38\u9009\u7a81\u51fa\u4fdd\u7559\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e93\u5b58\u8ba2\u8d2d\u91cf\u5bf9\u6240\u9009\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u6709\u62c9\u5411\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u96f6\u552e\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u3002"}}

This landmark result kicked off decades of research on designing linear or nearly linear-time algorithms on planar graphs. In an attempt to generalize Lipton-Tarjan's theorem to nonplanar graphs, Alon, Seymour, and Thomas [STOC '90, Journal of the AMS '90] showed that any minor-free graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ that can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ time. The superlinear running time in their separator theorem is a key bottleneck for generalizing algorithmic results from planar to minor-free graphs. Despite extensive research for more than two decades, finding a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ in (linear) $O(n)$ time for minor-free graphs remains a major open problem. Known algorithms either give a separator of size much larger than $O(\\sqrt{n})$ or have superlinear running time, or both.\n  In this paper, we answer the open problem affirmatively. Our algorithm is very simple: it runs a vertex-weighted variant of breadth-first search (BFS) a constant number of times on the input graph. Our key technical contribution is a weighting scheme on the vertices to guide the search for a balanced separator, offering a new connection between the size of a balanced separator and the existence of a clique-minor model.

One possible strategy involves generating a unique user (or item) profile from historical interaction data, which is then mapped to a semantic representation in the language space. However, a single-instance profile may be insufficient to comprehensively capture the complex intentions behind a user's interacted items. Moreover, due to the inherent instability of LLMs, a biased or misinterpreted profile could even undermine the original recommendation performance. Consequently, an intuitive solution is to generate multiple profiles for each user (or item), each reflecting a distinct aspect of their characteristics. In light of this, we propose a unified recommendation framework with multi-faceted profile extrapolation (ProEx) in this paper. By leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, we construct multiple distinct profiles for each user and item. These new profiles are subsequently mapped into semantic vectors, extrapolating from the position of the original profile to explore a broader region of the language space. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of environments, where each environment represents a possible linear combination of all profiles.

GAMBiT embeds insights from cognitive science into cyber environments through cognitive triggers, which activate biases such as loss aversion, base-rate neglect, and sunk-cost fallacy, and through newly developed cognitive sensors that infer attackers' cognitive states from behavioral and network data. Three rounds of human-subject experiments (total n=61) in a simulated small business network demonstrate that these manipulations significantly disrupt attacker performance, reducing mission progress, diverting actions off the true attack path, and increasing detectability. These results demonstrate that cognitive biases can be systematically triggered to degrade the attacker's efficiency and enhance the defender's advantage.

However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the \"Structure Gap\" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to \"hallucinated\" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B.

Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \\textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MLP\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8MLP\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709MLP\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u7684MLP\u6784\u9020\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4ef7\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b58\u50a8MLP\u5728\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

An established approach is to use estimators based on learned spectral features, that is, features spanning the top singular subspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. While powerful, such features are agnostic to the outcome variable. Consequently, the method can fail when the true causal function is poorly represented by these dominant singular functions. To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware. Our method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that incorporates information from the outcome. By learning these task-specific features, our approach remains effective even under spectral misalignment.

Prior work on knowledge poisoning attacks primarily inject false or toxic content, which fact-checking or linguistic analysis easily detects. We reveal a new and subtle threat: bias injection attacks, which insert factually correct yet semantically biased passages into the knowledge base to covertly influence the ideological framing of answers generated by large language models (LLMs).

Although LLMs can usually maintain correct logical structures across programming languages, they frequently struggle when dealing with framework-specific APIs or syntax, resulting in errors. This indicates that while pre-training equips LLMs with general algorithmic capabilities, they remain unfamiliar with the distinctive syntax and API usage of underrepresented frameworks. As a result, even advanced commercial models like GPT-4o cannot reliably generate correct code without prior adaptation. To address this issue, we propose APIKG4SYN, a framework designed to exploit API knowledge graphs for the construction of API-oriented question-code pairs, specifically tailored for low-resource frameworks without requiring executable code. APIKG4SYN integrates both single-API and multi-API knowledge, where the latter is derived through uncertainty estimation (UE)-driven Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling the creation of a diverse and informative dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Using HarmonyOS as a case study, we build the first benchmark for HarmonyOS code generation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning Qwen with APIKG4SYN raises pass@1 accuracy to 25.00%, compared with 17.59% for the baseline GPT model.

This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCogEvo - Edu\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8eSTEM\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DSP - EduBench\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355LLM\u548c\u9759\u6001RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5bfc\u5e08\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u5982DSP\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCogEvo - Edu\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCPL\u3001KEL\u548cMCL\u5c42\uff1b\u6784\u5efaDSP - EduBench\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u6a21\u578bLLM - as - a - Judge\u96c6\u6210\uff0cCogEvo - Edu\u5c06\u603b\u5206\u4ece5.32\u63d0\u9ad8\u52309.23\uff0c\u516d\u9879\u6307\u6807\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u6863\u6848\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \\textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \\textit{AUROC}, \\textit{AUPR}, and \\textit{FPR@95\\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \\textbf{\\(\\!\\approx\\!\\) 0 FPR@95\\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTIE\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5916\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTIE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6807\u51c6n\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a(n + 1)\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53cd\u8f6c\u548c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "TIE\u6846\u67b6\u5728MNIST\u6216FashionMNIST\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5982\u572895%\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd10\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TIE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

From the generative perspective, Smart Bayes relaxes the fixed unit weights of Naive Bayes by allowing data-driven coefficients on density-ratio features. From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates.

Traditional relevance models typically produce scalar scores or directly predict relevance labels, limiting both interpretability and the modeling of complex relevance signals. Inspired by recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex tasks, we investigate whether explicit reasoning can enhance both interpretability and performance in relevance modeling. However, existing reasoning-based Generative Relevance Models (GRMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning on large amounts of human-annotated or synthetic CoT data, which often leads to limited generalization. Moreover, domain-agnostic, free-form reasoning tends to be overly generic and insufficiently grounded, limiting its potential to handle the diverse and ambiguous cases prevalent in open-domain search. In this work, we formulate relevance modeling in Xiaohongshu search as a reasoning task and introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework to enhance the grounded reasoning capabilities of GRMs. Specifically, we incorporate practical business-specific relevance criteria into the multi-step reasoning prompt design and propose Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM), a lightweight process-supervision strategy which facilitates effective learning of these criteria through improved credit assignment.

This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms.

This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7ad9\u95f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPPR - UCB\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\u95f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u534f\u8c03\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u627e\u5230\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d8b\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPPR - UCB\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u9785\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0b\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPPR - UCB\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u5185\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u6548\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "PPR - UCB\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7ad9\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5bfb\u627e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5747\u8861\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002"}}

Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \\emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric.

Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models.

This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones.

Our approach involves applying PCA to the original data and K-means to the transposed data set, where the original variables are converted into observations.

In this paper, we experimentally examine whether timing still affects behavior in such games, using the Traveler's Dilemma and the Trust Game.

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.\n  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates.

In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future.

With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDelta Sum Learning\u6539\u8fdbGossip Learning\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eOpen Application Model\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "Federated\u548cGossip Learning\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDelta Sum Learning\u6539\u8fdbGossip Learning\u57fa\u672c\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eOpen Application Model\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u8282\u70b9\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u523050\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e58%\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0b\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Delta Sum Learning\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHistoricalML\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u5608\u6742\u3001\u7f3a\u5c11\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u9700\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\uff08Shapley\u503c\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u6218\u524d\u5fb7\u56fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u51fa\u5e03\u533f\u6218\u4e89\u80dc\u7387\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u627e\u51fa\u8fe6\u592a\u57fa\u80dc\u8d1f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "HistoricalML\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cShapley\u5206\u914d\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world.

However, existing regression testing approaches face critical limitations, especially in common gray-box settings where full source code access is unavailable: they heavily rely on manual effort for test case construction, struggle to maintain growing suites plagued by redundancy, and lack efficient mechanisms for prioritizing relevant tests. These challenges result in excessive testing costs, limited automation, and insufficient bug detection. To address these issues, we propose SAGE, a semanticaware regression testing framework for gray-box game environments. SAGE systematically addresses the core challenges of test generation, maintenance, and selection. It employs LLM-guided reinforcement learning for efficient, goal-oriented exploration to automatically generate a diverse foundational test suite. Subsequently, it applies a semantic-based multi-objective optimization to refine this suite into a compact, high-value subset by balancing cost, coverage, and rarity.

Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4f34\u968f\u6b3a\u9a97\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b3a\u9a97\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63a8\u51faMM - DeceptionBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u6b65\u5e26\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b3a\u9a97\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u76f2\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b3a\u9a97\u76d1\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u51faMM - DeceptionBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b3a\u9a97\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728GPT - 4o\u4e0aCohen's kappa\u63d0\u53471.5\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.25\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPolynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD)\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Neural Sheaf Diffusion\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c1Neural Sheaf Diffusion\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56SVD\u57fa\u7684\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9010\u8fb9\u9650\u5236\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u5efa\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPolyNSD\uff0c\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u5b50\u662f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u7684K\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e09\u9879\u9012\u63a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5bf9\u89d2\u9650\u5236\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5927\u830e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "conclusion": "PolyNSD\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Neural Sheaf Diffusion\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Predictively oriented (PrO) approaches lift the statistical model $P_\u03b8$ to an (infinite) mixture model $\\int P_\u03b8\\; \\mathrm{d}Q(\u03b8)$ and fit this predictive distribution via minimising an entropy-regularised objective functional. In the well-specified setting one expects the mixing distribution $Q$ to concentrate around the true data-generating parameter in the large data limit, while such singular concentration will typically not be observed if the model is misspecified. Our contribution is to demonstrate that one can empirically detect model misspecification by comparing the standard Bayesian posterior to the PrO `posterior' $Q$. To operationalise this, we present an efficient numerical algorithm based on variational gradient descent. A simulation study, and a more detailed case study involving a Bayesian inverse problem in seismology, confirm that model misspecification can be automatically detected using this framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u5411\uff08PrO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u548cPrO\u2018\u540e\u9a8c\u2019Q\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5b9a\u826f\u597d\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u540e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u548cPrO\u2018\u540e\u9a8c\u2019Q\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5730\u9707\u5b66\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u548cPrO\u2018\u540e\u9a8c\u2019Q\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6307\u5b9a\u3002"}}

In addition, our construction shows that sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets suffices for efficient universal computation. Our proof leverages multi-queue TMs as a bridge.

Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets.

Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case.

While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths.

They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular.

Evaluating the fit of these computer models involves tuning their parameters to observational data from IBEX. This would be a classic (Bayesian) inverse problem if not for three challenges: (1) the computer simulations are slow, limiting the size of campaigns of runs; so (2) surrogate modeling is essential, but outputs are high-resolution images, thwarting conventional methods; and (3) IBEX observations are counts, whereas most inverse problem techniques assume Gaussian field data. To fill that gap we propose a novel approach to Bayesian inverse problems coupling a Poisson response with a sparse Gaussian process surrogate using the Vecchia approximation.

These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\uff08SSR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8c31\u5e26\u63a9\u853d\u8c03\u8282\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5408\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes, while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a {delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment} targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention.

This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u72b6\u51b5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6316\u6398\u548c\u5206\u67902017 - 2025\u5e74\u95f4640\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6309\u56db\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7528\u4e03\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4ef6\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4ef6\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6587\u6863\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5fbd\u7ae0\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51cf\u8f7b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

In healthcare, for instance, a referral for a diagnostic test is influenced by the patient's health, their preferences, available resources, and the practitioner's recommendations. Despite the extensive literature on the informativeness of missingness, its implications on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been studied. Through a series of experiments on data from Columbia University Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center, and MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that patterns of missingness significantly impact zero-shot predictive performance. Notably, the explicit inclusion of missingness indicators at prompting benefits some while hurting other LLMs' zero-shot predictive performance and calibration, suggesting an inconsistent impact. The proposed aggregated analysis and theoretical insights suggest that larger models benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted. The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of missingness, often neglected even in conventional ML, even further.

We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments.

The Great Recession has rekindled a debate on the validity and stability of the Phillips Curve which is still ongoing. The basis for this debate is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without causing a drop in inflation. This paper carries out an empirical analysis for the classical expectation-augmented Phillips curve model across 41 countries from1980-2016 by distinguishing tranquil and recessionary periods separately. Based on the results of the research, the paper finds that dynamics of Phillips Curve changes during recessionary periods and the empirical relationship becomes no longer valid. These findings support the ongoing debate about the missing disinflation and collapse of the Phillips curve, but only during the recessionary periods. In the case of tranquil periods, the empirical relationship still seems to be valid. Moreover, the paper also observes that both backward-looking and forward-looking fractions of inflation gain weight and significance during recessionary periods.

Preprint, to appear in KDD'26", "summary": "Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.\n  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.\n  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\\times$ reduction in runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784AutoBRANE\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6267\u884c\u6b65\u9aa4\u5dee\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u652f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1AutoBRANE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee55%\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoBRANE\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u3002"}}

A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18/\u67a2\u7ebd/\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eBILP\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e0b\u8fb9\u7f18/\u67a2\u7ebd/\u4e91\u67b6\u6784\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u7b80\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08BILP\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u4f53\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Corresponding author is Zheng Zheng", "summary": "Quantum computing is gaining attention from academia and industry. With the quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs), programmers can develop quantum software to explore the power of quantum computing. However, programmers may face challenges in understanding quantum software due to the non-intuitive quantum mechanics. To facilitate software development and maintenance, code comments offered in quantum SDKs serve as a natural language explanation of program functionalities and logical flows. Despite their importance, scarce research systematically reports their value and provides constructive guidelines for programmers. To address this gap, our paper focuses on Qiskit, one of the most popular quantum SDKs, and presents CC4Q, the first dataset of code comments for quantum computing. CC4Q incorporates 9677 code comment pairs and 21970 sentence-level code comment units, the latter of which involve heavy human annotation.

Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.\n  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario.

This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8def\u7531\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u534f\u8bae\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u8def\u7531\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u5907\u591a\u8df3Wi - Fi\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5f71\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6563\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7528\u4f8b\u3002"}}

However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

We propose EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination), an inference-time criterion that adaptively stops denoising once sufficient reasoning stability relative to training-time reasoning is detected. EDIT monitors the alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). During training, optimization dynamics generate rich metadata about parameter importance that in prior methods is typically discarded upon model release. We preserve this information as a compact representation of learned reasoning pathways. During inference, alignment scores are converted to a distribution over the tokens already unmasked at the current denoising step, and convergence is detected when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below a threshold on the matched unmasked (visible) tokens.

However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data.

Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves utility close to non-private baselines while offering substantially stronger privacy and communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFed - Sparse - BNSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5206\u6563\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f83\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5206\u6563\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u907f\u514d\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u968f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5927\u5e45\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Fed - Sparse - BNSL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u8fb9\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFed - Sparse - BNSL\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed - Sparse - BNSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u5e0c - \u7b7e\u540d\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e38\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u5bc6\u8bc1\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u7b7e\u540d\u65b9\u6848\u957f\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u5bf9\u624b\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u54c8\u5e0c - \u7b7e\u540d\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u54c8\u5e0c - \u7b7e\u540d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u5ef6\u957f\u73b0\u6709\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

Objective: We define the concepts of technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering, and develop and validate a psychometric scale that measures attitudes toward them. Method: Grounded in theories of infrastructure, attitudes, and prior work on psychometric measurement, we defined the target constructs and generated scale items. The scale was administered to 225 software professionals and evaluated using a split sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on one half of the sample to uncover the underlying factor structure and performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half to validate the structure. Further analyses with the whole sample assessed face, criterion-related, and discriminant validity. Results: EFA supported a two-factor structure (technical and sociotechnical infrastructure), accounting for 65% of the total variance with strong loadings. CFA confirmed excellent model fit. Face and content validity were supported by the item content reflecting cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Both subscales were correlated with job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, and feedback from the job itself, supporting convergent validity.

While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks.

Proceedings of APRIS2025", "summary": "Accurate estimation of the Worst-Case Deadline Failure Probability (WCDFP) has attracted growing attention as a means to provide safety assurances in complex systems such as robotic platforms and autonomous vehicles. WCDFP quantifies the likelihood of deadline misses under the most pessimistic operating conditions, and safe estimation is essential for dependable real-time applications. However, achieving high accuracy in WCDFP estimation often incurs significant computational cost. Recent studies have revealed that the classical assumption of the critical instant, the activation pattern traditionally considered to trigger the worst-case behavior, can lead to underestimation of WCDFP in probabilistic settings. This observation motivates the use of a revised critical instant formulation that more faithfully captures the true worst-case scenario. This paper investigates convolution-based methods for WCDFP estimation under this revised setting and proposes an optimization technique that accelerates convolution by improving the merge order. Extensive experiments with diverse execution-time distributions demonstrate that the proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to Sequential Convolution, while retaining accurate and safe-sided WCDFP estimates.

However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains.

Analyzing 14,300 GitHub commits across 7,393 repositories from 2023-2025, we investigated attribution strategies and community responses across eight major AI tools. Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%). Explicit attribution triggers modest scrutiny (23% more questions and 21% more comments) but tool choice matters 20-30 times more for predicting reception. Community sentiment remains neutral regardless of attribution type, suggesting curiosity rather than hostility. Temporal analyses show rapid norm evolution: explicit attribution increased from near-zero in early 2024 to 40% by late 2025, indicating community adaptation. These findings illuminate attribution as strategic communication rather than simple transparency, advancing understanding of algorithmic accountability and norm formation during technological transitions.

Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53c2\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d7\u65f6\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u7528DRIPS\u6784\u5efa\u7ebf\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528FML\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u6b63\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "DRIPS\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0cFML\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5d4c\u5165\uff08DTE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u68f5\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\uff0c\u5927\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6811\u7684\u53f6\u5206\u533a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u989d\u5916\u81ea\u52a9\u6811\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDTE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "DTE\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u88c2\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6216\u4ece\u6811\u884d\u751f\u951a\u70b9\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales. Our work highlights the potential of upcycle and merge MoE structures for improving both robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u5408\u5e76MoE\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RLHF\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3aMoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u6355\u83b7\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u8def\u7531\u6743\u91cd\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u5e76\u56de\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u5408\u5e76MoE\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u5347RLHF\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUNIQ\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5b83\u4eec\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u5b58\uff0c\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUNIQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cJIT\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548cQPU\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "UNIQ\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Objective: This study investigates how job satisfaction, work-life balance, job embeddedness, and their antecedents, including job quality, personality traits, attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure, and perceptions of organizational justice, relate to software professionals' turnover intentions. Method: We conducted a geographically diverse cross-sectional survey of software professionals (N = 224) and analyzed the data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our model includes both reflective and formative constructs and tests 15 hypotheses grounded in occupational psychology and software engineering literature. Results: Job satisfaction and embeddedness were significantly negatively associated with software professionals' turnover intentions, while work-life balance showed no direct effect. The strongest antecedents for job satisfaction were work-life balance and job quality, while organizational justice was the strongest predictor of job embeddedness. Discussion: The resulting PLS-SEM model has considerably higher explanatory power for key outcome variables than previous work conducted in the software development context, highlighting the importance of both psychological (e.g., job satisfaction, job embeddedness) and organizational (e.g., organizational justice, job quality) factors in understanding turnover intentions of software professionals. Our results imply that improving job satisfaction and job embeddedness is the key to retaining software professionals. In turn, enhancing job quality, supporting work-life balance, and ensuring high organizational justice can improve job satisfaction and embeddedness, indirectly reducing turnover intentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u751f\u6d3b\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u95f4\u63a5\u964d\u4f4e\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u4e1a\u81ea\u613f\u79bb\u804c\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d41\u5931\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9224\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7528\u504f\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLS - SEM\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u542b\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd515\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u751f\u6d3b\u5e73\u8861\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5de5\u4f5c\u751f\u6d3b\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u662f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u524d\u56e0\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u516c\u5e73\u662f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "PLS - SEM\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ea6\u662f\u7559\u4f4f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u751f\u6d3b\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u95f4\u63a5\u964d\u4f4e\u79bb\u804c\u610f\u5411\u3002"}}

Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge.

The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion.

In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the unavoidable induced substructures of graphs with large pathwidth or large treewidth. In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \\geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families. This constitutes a significant step toward classifying the graphs $H$ for which every weakly sparse $H$-induced-minor-free class has bounded treewidth.

Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology.

This slows comprehension, increases the risk of subtle bugs, and makes it harder for both humans and large language models (LLMs) to reason about code. We study variable name repair: given a real C++ function where all occurrences of one local or parameter name have been replaced by a placeholder (e.g. ID 1), the goal is to generate a natural, descriptive replacement name. We automatically construct this task from the C++ portion of BigCode's The Stack by parsing functions with Tree-sitter, masking a single identifier, and treating the original name as supervision. On top of Llama 3.1-8B, we build a pipeline with (i) warmup and dropout schedules for more stable fine-tuning, (ii) LoRA adapters for efficient specialization on identifier repair, and (iii) a dual-encoder reranker over top-k generator candidates. We evaluate using exact match, Top-5 Hit, and an embedding-based partial similarity score (0-100) that gives credit for near synonyms and format variants (e.g., jsonValue vs. json). On a held-out set of 200 C++ functions, a zero-shot Llama 3.1 baseline reaches 6.1 percent exact match. Our best LoRA-tuned model (with warmup and dropout) achieves 43.1 percent exact match, 50.2 percent Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score.

Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective.

Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165MMAG\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Heero\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MMAG\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\uff0c\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7075\u611f\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Heero\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5df2\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MMAG\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5bcc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects.

However, although they demonstrate strong P&R capabilities in English GUI scenarios, their performance in multilingual settings has received little attention, which limits their global applications. Moreover, existing studies on GUI tasks lack fine-grained analyses, including widget functions and elements' spatial relationships, which are fundamental for more targeted improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose MPR-GUI-Bench, a Multilingual fine-grained Perception and Reasoning GUI Benchmark to evaluate GUI agents' P&R capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate that LVLMs exhibit significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages than in English. To address these gaps, we propose GUI-XLI, a GUI Cross-Lingual Intervention method that applies interventions to the hidden states at P&R capability-related layers to mitigate the gaps between English and other languages, building on previous research showing that the hidden states of different language inputs exhibit significant differences in the latent space.

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

Current fairness interventions often adopt a difference-unaware perspective that enforces uniform treatment across demographic groups. These approaches, however, fail to distinguish between contexts where neutrality is required and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and must be preserved. Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5e73\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6BioPro\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ee7\u627f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u516c\u5e73\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6BioPro\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6027\u522b\u53d8\u5f02\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e2d\u548c\u6027\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "BioPro\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u660e\u786e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u522b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u504f\u5dee\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "BioPro\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity.

For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity.

With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6LAURA\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAURA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5ba1\u67e5\u793a\u4f8b\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "LAURA\u8ba9ChatGPT - 4o\u548cDeepSeek v3\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe42.2%\u548c40.4%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u8bba\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "LAURA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u8bc4\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.\n  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench.

Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eAgentic AI\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe47.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u9ad8\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8f66\u8def\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8def\u8fb9\u5355\u5143\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u8f66\u8f86\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5728\u8f66\u8f66\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u90bb\u8f66\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534747.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eAgentic AI\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies.

Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \\emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\\{A, B\\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\\min\\{A, B\\}\\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\\,\\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5ME - Nash - QL\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u70ed\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5ME - Nash - QL\u3002", "result": "ME - Nash - QL\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u70ed\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ME - Nash - QL\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets.

Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve.

However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMMQAKE\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30MKE\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHybrid - DMKG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MKE\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u8ff0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MMQAKE\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faHybrid - DMKG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHybrid - DMKG\u5728MMQAKE\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MKE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "Hybrid - DMKG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dMKE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model.

We present Package Dashboard, a cross-ecosystem framework that provides a unified platform for supply chain analysis, enabling a holistic, dual-perspective risk assessment by integrating package metadata, vulnerability information, and upstream community health metrics. By combining dependency resolution with repository analysis, it reduces cognitive load and improves traceability. Demonstrating the framework's versatility, a large-scale study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions shows its ability to uncover not only conventional vulnerabilities and license conflicts but also overlooked risks such as archived or inaccessible repositories.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faS^2 - KD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u80cc\u540e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49 - \u9891\u8c31\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728WeatherBench\u548cTaxiBJ+\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cS^2 - KD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b80\u5355\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "S^2 - KD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u8ba9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a \"what-if\" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model.

However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.\n  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.\n  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210REST API\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540d\u79f0\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516b\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u540d\u79f0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u516b\u79cd\u751f\u6210REST API\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u540d\u79f0\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b21\u8c03\u67e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0eGemini\u548cGPT - 4o\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPT - 3.5\uff0c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u53cd\u9988\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u547d\u540d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u53cb\u597d\u7684API\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool.

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions.

This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world scenarios.Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, na\u00efve merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient. In this work, we emphasize the importance of \\emph{directional alignment} and introduce a unified geometric framework, \\emph{Merging with Directional Alignment} (\\method{}), which aligns directional structures consistently in both the parameter and feature spaces. Our analysis shows that directional alignment improves structural coherence, and extensive experiments across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations further validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4ee5\u5f80\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6MDA\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6MDA\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation.

Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{\\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks.

We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance.

Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.\n  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS.

A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faShielded Controller Units (SCUs)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u786e\u4fdd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6cb9\u8017\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u7535\u6c60\u635f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee3\u7406\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Shielded Controller Units (SCUs)\uff0c\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aSCU\u7ba1\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u914d\u5907SCUs\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u6cb9\u8017\u964d\u4f4e24%\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u7535\u6c60\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "SCUs\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u51b3\u7b56\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \\textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \\textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications.

In this work, we propose a graph-based forecasting framework that first constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity, and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) for prediction. This approach enables interpretable analysis by revealing which signals are more predictable and which relationships contribute most to forecasting accuracy.

Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models.

In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards.

Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint.

While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty.

However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training.

To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRep3Net\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728PARP - 1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfQSAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRep3Net\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u6570\u636e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53caChemBERTa\u751f\u6210\u7684SMILES\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u62fc\u63a5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728PARP - 1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8eGCN\u3001GAT\u3001XGBoost\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5316\u5408\u7269\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $\u03a9(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.\n  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data.

As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model.\n  We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications.

However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines.

The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points.

This paper aims at addressing this issue by improving the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a state-of-the-art glassbox model that delivers both high accuracy and complete transparency. The paper outlines three distinct enhancement methodologies: targeted hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods, the implementation of a custom multi-objective function for fairness for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-start scenarios. All three methodologies are evaluated across standard benchmark datasets, including the Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease datasets. The analysis indicates that while the tuning process yielded marginal improvements in the primary ROC AUC metric, it led to a subtle but important shift in the model's decision-making behavior, demonstrating the value of a multi-faceted evaluation beyond a single performance score.

To formally address this issue, we study \\emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \\emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \\emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \\emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice.

While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \\textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \\textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results.

Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faKG - \u5f15\u5bfc\u7684CoT\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eMIMIC - III\u4e2d\u5c31\u8bca\u7ea7\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u83b7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e8b\u540e\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u4ef7\u503c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ICD - 9\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u5230PrimeKG\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7528\u4e8eCoT\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u6599\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0cKG\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cAUROC\u4e3a0.66 - 0.70\uff0cmacro - AUPR\u4e3a0.40 - 0.47\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230CRADLE\u961f\u5217\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "KG\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684CoT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u83b7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $\u03bb_\u03b1$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders).

To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood.

While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \\textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk.

Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity.

Abstract shortened based on arxiv requirement", "summary": "Differential privacy is increasingly formalized through the lens of hypothesis testing via the robust and interpretable $f$-DP framework, where privacy guarantees are encoded by a baseline Blackwell trade-off function $f_{\\infty} = T(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ involving a pair of distributions $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$. The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.\n  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\\otimes n}, Q_n^{\\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\\infty}, Q_{\\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \\log(dQ_{\\infty} / dP_{\\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u53ef\u5206\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Le Cam\u7406\u8bba\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6781\u9650\u57fa\u51c6\u6743\u8861\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u51fa\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u53d7Le Cam\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6781\u9650\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7a77\u53ef\u5206\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e8c\u5143\u6781\u9650\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6781\u9650\u6743\u8861\u51fd\u6570\u7531\u65e0\u7a77\u53ef\u5206\u5b9a\u5f8b\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6062\u590dGDP\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3GDP\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u7531\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6781\u9650\u57fa\u51c6\u6743\u8861\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems.

Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u7528\u9014\u6279\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5e72\u6270\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5b8c\u5168\u524d\u77bb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7d27\u5f20\u5ea6\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7d27\u5f20\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82e5\u5e72\u6270\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value.

Present affiliation: Iambic Therapeutics", "summary": "This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder.

While traditional point-to-point pathfinding algorithms for EVs assume a known initial energy level, many real-world scenarios involving uncertainty in available energy require planning optimal paths for all possible initial energy levels, a task known as energy-optimal profile search. Existing solutions typically rely on specialized profile-merging procedures within a label-correcting framework that results in searching over complex profiles. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search, which employs a novel profile dominance rule to avoid generating and handling complex profiles. We develop four variants of our method and evaluate them on real-world road networks enriched with realistic energy consumption data.

Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.\n  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.\n  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight.

We (i) formalize Overton pluralism as a set coverage metric (OvertonScore), (ii) conduct a large-scale U.S.-representative human study (N = 1209; 60 questions; 8 LLMs), and (iii) develop an automated benchmark that closely reproduces human judgments. On average, models achieve OvertonScores of 0.35--0.41, with DeepSeek V3 performing best; yet all models remain far below the theoretical maximum of 1.0, revealing substantial headroom for improvement.

Hence, we propose an automated benchmark that achieves high rank correlation with human judgments ($\u03c1=0.88$), providing a practical proxy without replacing human assessment.

This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall.

Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs.

However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns.

These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges.

Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods.

In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $\u03b1$ and the variable selection ratio $\u03c1$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = \u03b1N$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = \u03c1N$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $\u03c1N$ dimensions can separate $\u03b1N$ random patterns if and only if $\u03b1< 2\u03c1$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification.

We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods.

Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers.

In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines.

While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints.

In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies.

In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size.

Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance.

A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790DPO\u548cPPO\u4e24\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7b97\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9PO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u542f\u53d1\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9DPO\u548cPPO\u5dee\u5f02\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8d1f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "DPO\u76ee\u6807\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cPPO\u76ee\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9PO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged.

Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions.

We introduce a framework for estimating a model's intrinsic dimensionality by treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace of the model's full capacity. Our approach: train a full-rank teacher, factorize its weights at multiple ranks, and train each factorized student via distillation to measure performance as a function of rank.\n  We define effective rank as a region, not a point: the smallest contiguous set of ranks for which the student reaches 85-95% of teacher accuracy. To stabilize estimates, we fit accuracy vs. rank with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify crossings of the normalized curve. We also define the effective knee as the rank maximizing perpendicular distance between the smoothed accuracy curve and its endpoint secant; an intrinsic indicator of where marginal gains concentrate.\n  On ViT-B/32 fine-tuned on CIFAR-100 (one seed, due to compute constraints), factorizing linear blocks and training with distillation yields an effective-rank region of approximately [16, 34] and an effective knee at r* ~ 31. At rank 32, the student attains 69.46% top-1 accuracy vs. 73.35% for the teacher (~94.7% of baseline) while achieving substantial parameter compression.

To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30CBMs\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CBMs\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80CBMs\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u80fd\u5426\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30CBMs\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4f7f\u7528CBMs\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "CBMs\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6DNNs\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CBMs\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal Cooperative Game (CCG) framework, which conceptualizes MLC as a cooperative multi-player interaction. CCG unifies explicit causal discovery via Neural Structural Equation Models with a counterfactual curiosity reward to drive robust feature learning. Furthermore, it incorporates a causal invariance loss to ensure generalization across diverse environments, complemented by a specialized enhancement strategy for rare labels. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that CCG substantially outperforms strong baselines in both rare label prediction and overall robustness.

With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware.

To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior.

Despite promising demonstrations, SDTs face persistent challenges: fusing heterogeneous imaging, kinematics, and physiology under strict latency budgets; balancing model fidelity with computational efficiency; ensuring robustness, interpretability, and calibrated uncertainty; and achieving interoperability, privacy, and regulatory compliance in clinical environments. This survey offers a critical, structured review of SDTs. We clarify terminology and scope, propose a taxonomy by purpose, model fidelity, and data sources, and synthesize state-of-the-art achievements in deformable registration and tracking, real-time simulation and co-simulation, AR/VR guidance, edge-cloud orchestration, and AI for scene understanding and prediction.

Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies.

Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684KTA v2\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKTA v2\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5c0f\u516c\u5171\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u51e0\u7387\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6559\u5e08\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u53d1\u9001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u84b8\u998f\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728FEMNIST\u3001CIFAR - 10\u548cAG News\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cKTA v2\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8aFedMD\u5f0f\u5168\u5c40\u6559\u5e08\u3002\u5982\u5728CIFAR - 10\u4e0a\u4ee5\u7ea61/1100\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u8fbe\u523057.7%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728AG News\u4e0a\u4ee5\u7ea61/300\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u8fbe\u523089.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "KTA v2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as \"mass\" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $\u03b5$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($\u03b5< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGravitational Federated Clustering (GFC) \u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5728LDP\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3aLDP\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLDP\u4e0b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d28\u5fc3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u529b\u52bf\u573a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u62d3\u6251\u805a\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u754c\u9650\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GFC\u5c06\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u9690\u79c1 - \u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on \"which city this sequence comes from\", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.\n  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).\n  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance.

Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparam- eters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search.

We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165NL4RA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001LM4Opt RA\u6846\u67b6\u548cLAME\u6307\u6807\uff0cLlama - 3.1 - 70B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165NL4RA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLM4Opt RA\u591a\u5019\u9009\u6846\u67b6\u548cLAME\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "Llama - 3.1 - 70B\u7684LAME\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.8007\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002"}}

Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u867dLLM\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u662f\u9ad8\u65485G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u5230\u5207\u7247\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e00\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7528LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u914d\u7528\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u8bf7\u6c42\u5230\u5207\u7247\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5236\u5b9a\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0cLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bf7\u6c42\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bLLM\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u5207\u7247\u5206\u914d\u521d\u7a3f\uff0c\u867d\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u7ec4\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u5207\u7247\u9694\u79bb\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u662f\u9ad8\u65485G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers.

To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.\n  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7f16\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u63a2\u7d22\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7f16\u8bd11.614\u4ebftoken\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03Qwen - 2.5VL - 32B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6YKSUniform\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u738778.6%\uff0c\u4ec5\u6bd4Gemini 2.0 Flash\u4f4e1.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u6784\u6210\u548c\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8d77\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4f7f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant.

Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm.

However, real-world environments almost never realize fully group-invariant MDPs; dynamics, actuation limits, and reward design usually break symmetries, often only locally. Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking.

In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning.

To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies. Most importantly, aiming at non-stationarity, a Frequency-Domain Stationarity Correction mechanism adaptively suppresses distribution shift impacts from environment change by spectrum alignment.

This survey offers a comprehensive overview of DRL-based approaches to socially aware navigation, highlighting key aspects such as proxemics, human comfort, naturalness, trajectory and intention prediction, which enhance robot interaction in human environments. This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications.

Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6MIRA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u65e0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u542b\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemory - Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210Hopfield\u5f0f\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u952e\u6765\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMIRA\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "MIRA\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4efb\u52a1\u5207\u6362\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards.

To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event.

KANs' key innovation lies in the use of learnable non-linear activation functions, which are parametrized as splines. Splines are expressed as a linear combination of basis functions (B-splines). B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference. We show that, while SAs can be used to accelerate part of the KAN inference, their utilization can be reduced to 30%. Hence, we propose KAN-SAs, a novel SA-based accelerator that leverages intrinsic properties of B-splines to enable efficient KAN inference. By including a nonrecursive B-spline implementation and leveraging the intrinsic KAN sparsity, KAN-SAs enhances conventional SAs, enabling efficient KAN inference, in addition to conventional DNNs. KAN-SAs achieves up to 100% SA utilization and up to 50% clock cycles reduction compared to conventional SAs of equivalent area, as shown by hardware synthesis results on a 28nm FD-SOI technology.

A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation.

Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories.

Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that adapts policies for faster execution without additional demonstration, but its unguided exploration is sample inefficient. We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations.

In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2.

However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636ODE\u540e\u63a5MLP\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u8361\u5668\u903c\u8fd1\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0eMLP\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5012\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u8361\u5668\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e8c\u9636ODE\u540e\u63a5MLP\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u8361\u5668\u903c\u8fd1\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u903c\u8fd1\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2aMLP\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5012\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u503c\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \\times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3001\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u8f93\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u9700\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06$L^2$\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u754c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u6838\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6298\u53e0\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6838\u5e73\u6ed1\u51cf\u8f7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u662f\u5f02\u6784\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent \u03b1 < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts.

However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings.

We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization.

A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.\n  We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.\n  Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive - lambda SISS\u6539\u8fdb\u9759\u6001lambda\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684Machine Unlearning\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cdlambda\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive - lambda SISS\u5c06lambda\u53d8\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ac\u65f6SISS\u635f\u5931\u9879\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94lambda\u539f\u7406\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7c7b\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u589e\u5f3aMNIST\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAdaptive - lambda SISS\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001lambda SISS\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u79fb\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Adaptive - lambda SISS\u5728Machine Unlearning\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often rely on explicit emotion labels that require costly annotation, underscoring the need for more flexible feeling-aligned methods. To support multimodal music generation, we construct ArtiCaps, a pseudo feeling-aligned image-music-text dataset created by semantically matching descriptions from ArtEmis and MusicCaps. We further propose Art2Music, a lightweight cross-modal framework that synthesizes music from artistic images and user comments. In the first stage, images and text are encoded with OpenCLIP and fused using a gated residual module; the fused representation is decoded by a bidirectional LSTM into Mel-spectrograms with a frequency-weighted L1 loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. In the second stage, a fine-tuned HiFi-GAN vocoder reconstructs high-quality audio waveforms. Experiments on ArtiCaps show clear improvements in Mel-Cepstral Distortion, Frechet Audio Distance, Log-Spectral Distance, and cosine similarity.

While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3.

Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%.

ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k.

Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs.

The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities.

Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \\ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data.

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.\n  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss.

Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71\u00b0C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85\u00b0C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55\u00b0C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95\u00b0C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6846\u67b6ThermAl\u89e3\u51b3\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u70ed\u5206\u6790\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u70ed\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThermAl\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408U - Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u70ed\u8017\u6563\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "ThermAl\u5bf9\u5927\u7535\u8def\u6e29\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0cRMSE\u4ec50.71\u00b0C\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFEM\u5de5\u5177\u5feb\u7ea6200\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "ThermAl\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u70ed\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u70ed\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21EDA\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7167\u660e\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282LED\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u63a7\u5236\u5960\u57fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7167\u660e\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u8282\u80fd\u7167\u660e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u578bQ\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636eLDR\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282LED\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u572813\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u5f3a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c130\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u5f3a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8d85\u8c03\u5c0f\u3001\u6536\u655b\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u4e5f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u8282\u80fd\u7167\u660e\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u63a7\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability.

Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDA - SHRED\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f20\u611f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA - SHRED\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528SHRED\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "DA - SHRED\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86SIM2REAL\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u3002"}}

Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details.

However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field.

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation.

However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

By employing a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, we model an alternative strategy that prioritizes the early acquisition of high-quality information assets. We simulate the entire upstream value chain-comprising competitive bidding, exploration, and development phases-to evaluate the economic impact of this approach relative to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate that front-loading information investment significantly reduces the costs associated with redundant data acquisition and enhances the precision of reserve valuation. Specifically, we find that the alternative strategy outperforms traditional methods in highly competitive environments by mitigating the \"winner's curse\" through more accurate bidding. Furthermore, the economic benefits are most pronounced during the development phase, where superior data quality minimizes capital misallocation. These findings suggest that optimal investment timing is structurally dependent on market competition rather than solely on price volatility, offering a new paradigm for capital allocation in extractive industries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6cb9\u6c14\u52d8\u63a2\u4e2d\u201c\u9636\u68af\u5f0f\u201d\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u5148\u65e9\u671f\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u6e38\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u884c\u6cb9\u6c14\u52d8\u63a2\u201c\u9636\u68af\u5f0f\u201d\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u5148\u65e9\u671f\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u6e38\u4ef7\u503c\u94fe\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u524d\u6295\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u50a8\u91cf\u4f30\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51cf\u8f7b\u201c\u8d62\u5bb6\u8bc5\u5492\u201d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u8d44\u65f6\u673a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u91c7\u6398\u4e1a\u8d44\u672c\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU).

However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost.

Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who presented to the emergency department between January 2022 and April 2025 and underwent same-day CXR and CT for febrile or respiratory symptoms. Reports from five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, and MedVersa) and radiologist-written reports were randomly presented and blindly evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination, and language clarity. Comparative performance was assessed using generalized linear mixed models, with radiologist-written reports treated as the reference. Finding-level analyses were also performed with CT as the reference. Results: A total of 478 patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 50-78]; 282 men [59.0%]) were included. AIRead demonstrated the lowest RADPEER 3b rate (5.3% [76/1434] vs. radiologists 13.9% [200/1434]; P<.001), whereas other VLMs showed higher disagreement rates (16.8-43.0%; P<.05). Clinical acceptability was the highest with AIRead (84.5% [1212/1434] vs. radiologists 74.3% [1065/1434]; P<.001), while other VLMs performed worse (41.1-71.4%; P<.05).

Language clarity was higher with AIRead (82.9% [1189/1434]), Lingshu (88.0% [1262/1434]), and MedVersa (88.4% [1268/1434]) compared with radiologists (78.1% [1120/1434]; P<.05).

Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51faBARPO\u6846\u67b6\u8c03\u548c\u4e8c\u8005\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eARPO\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4SPO\u548cARPO\u627e\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6743\u8861\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1BARPO\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00SPO\u548cARPO\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u624b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "BARPO\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901aARPO\u3002", "conclusion": "BARPO\u4e3a\u8c03\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters.

We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation.

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field.

We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement.

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.\n  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\\%) and SpQR (65.34\\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u6216\u65e0\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u524dk\u4e2a\u6743\u91cd\u4e3aFP32\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u4f59\u6743\u91cd\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSVD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728RTE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eAWQ\u548cSpQR\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e9\u9635\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly. Conclusion: This study provides a relatively objective and comprehensive evaluation method for early screening and personalized intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDH - SCSM - BLA\u52a8\u6001\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7684CCT\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMoCA\u7528\u20180/1\u2019\u4e8c\u5143\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30CCT\u65f6\uff0c\u4f4e\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8001\u4eba\u5f97\u5206\u6613\u4e3a0\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u81ea\u7814Cogni - CareV3.0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6536\u96c6CCT\u52a8\u6001\u7b14\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5206\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff08BiLSTM - Attention\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe86.69%\uff1b\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u7ed8\u56fe\u80fd\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u5728MCI\u60a3\u8005\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u5404\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5bf9\u5ba2\u89c2\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this manuscript, we benchmarked the performance of 47 CBQA models from Hugging Face on eight different datasets. This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts.

We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity.

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization.

Appendix), 2 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0fA - CC\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u65ad\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u52a9\u624b\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f6e\u7ba1\u9053\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ea7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Assertion - Conditioned Compliance (A - CC)\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00\u8c04\u5a9a\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u6e90\u65ad\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "A - CC\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RE - LLM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6c9f\u901a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRE - LLM\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "RE - LLM\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6c\u578b\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models.

This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u6355\u6349\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEXCAP\u6846\u67b6\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u5408\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9010\u70b9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEXCAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5668\u3001\u7531\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eEXCAP\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "EXCAP\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory.

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from.

However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance.

A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search over a terrain-aware configuration space.

However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations.

Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement.

Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.\n  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6807\u7b7e\u53d6\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u9ed1\u76d2\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u6216\u88ab\u6545\u610f\u9690\u7792\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u53d6\u8bc1\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u7b7e\u53d6\u8bc1\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u79cd\u5b50\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u7ec4\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea692.24%\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684HuggingFace\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u53d6\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684AI\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents.

We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated.

We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories.

However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric.

A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions.

However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction.

We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies.

This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \\textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization.

Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments.

To recapture the original goal of \"indistinguishable-from-reality\" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a \"Detector Reward\" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u67b6\u6784CACARA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u5174\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u9501\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e5f\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u67b6\u6784CACARA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u5174\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u65b0\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u8d85100\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u5230\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2dR@1\u63d0\u534714.24\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u5174\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u8bed\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u89e3\u9501\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample.

However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $\u03c4$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $\u03c3^2$ to $\u03c3^2/\u03c4$, where $\u03c3^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u8f6e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faST - GT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u591a\u8f6e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6Scaffold\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5ST - GT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u68af\u5ea6\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5c40\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eST - GT\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0b\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u3002", "conclusion": "ST - GT\u80fd\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5173\u4e8e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u9879\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6309\u9700\u751f\u6210\u672c\u6784\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CANN\uff09\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982CANN\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4eba\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6309\u9700\u751f\u6210CANN\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684CANN\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u52a0\u8f7d\u573a\u666f\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

This study presents an explainable multimodal deep learning framework for automatic lung-disease detection using respiratory audio signals. The proposed system integrates two complementary representations: a spectral-temporal encoder based on a CNN-BiLSTM Attention architecture, and a handcrafted acoustic-feature encoder capturing physiologically meaningful descriptors such as MFCCs, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, and zero-crossing rate. These branches are combined through late-stage fusion to leverage both data-driven learning and domain-informed acoustic cues. The model is trained and evaluated on the Asthma Detection Dataset Version 2 using rigorous preprocessing, including resampling, normalization, noise filtering, data augmentation, and patient-level stratified partitioning. The study achieved strong generalization with 91.21% accuracy, 0.899 macro F1-score, and 0.9866 macro ROC-AUC, outperforming all ablated variants.

Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively.

In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165Yoga - 16\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0cVGG16\u642d\u914dMediaPipe Pose\u9aa8\u67b6\u8f93\u5165\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d7\u4f24\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Yoga - 16\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u3001MediaPipe Pose\u9aa8\u67b6\u56fe\u50cf\u3001YOLOv8 Pose\u9aa8\u67b6\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08VGG16\u3001ResNet50\u548cXception\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Grad - CAM\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0cVGG16\u642d\u914dMediaPipe Pose\u9aa8\u67b6\u8f93\u5165\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fbe96.09%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5728\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u745c\u4f3d\u59ff\u52bf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures).

With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference.

This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements.

However, the inherent logical complexity of authorization policies, combined with the scarcity of high-quality \"Natural Language-to-ODRL\" training datasets, impedes the ability of current methods to efficiently and accurately translate complex rules from natural language into the ODRL format. To address this challenge, this research leverages the potent comprehension and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve both automation and high fidelity in this translation process. We introduce AgentODRL, a multi-agent system based on an Orchestrator-Workers architecture. The architecture consists of specialized Workers, including a Generator for ODRL policy creation, a Decomposer for breaking down complex use cases, and a Rewriter for simplifying nested logical relationships. The Orchestrator agent dynamically coordinates these Workers, assembling an optimal pathway based on the complexity of the input use case. Specifically, we enhance the ODRL Generator by incorporating a validator-based syntax strategy and a semantic reflection mechanism powered by a LoRA-finetuned model, significantly elevating the quality of the generated policies. Extensive experiments were conducted on a newly constructed dataset comprising 770 use cases of varying complexity, all situated within the context of data spaces. The results, evaluated using ODRL syntax and semantic scores, demonstrate that our proposed Orchestrator-Workers system, enhanced with these strategies, achieves superior performance on the ODRL generation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u4e3aODRL\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eOrchestrator - Workers\u67b6\u6784\u7684AgentODRL\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6388\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u903b\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u4e3aODRL\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eOrchestrator - Workers\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfAgentODRL\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u7684Workers\uff0cOrchestrator\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\uff1b\u589e\u5f3aODRL Generator\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53cd\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5305\u542b770\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528ODRL\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Orchestrator - Workers\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u5728ODRL\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion).

For deterministic multitape Turing machines over a fixed finite alphabet, this apparent linear dependence is not intrinsic: any length-$t$ run can be simulated in space $O(\\sqrt{t})$ via a Height Compression Theorem for succinct computation trees together with an Algebraic Replay Engine. In this paper we recast that construction in geometric and information-theoretic language. We interpret the execution trace as a spacetime dependency DAG and exhibit a family of recursively defined holographic boundary summaries such that, along the square-root-space simulation, the total description length of all boundary data stored at any time is $O(\\sqrt{t})$. Using Kolmogorov complexity, we prove that every internal configuration has constant conditional description complexity given the appropriate boundary summary and time index, establishing that the spacetime bulk carries no additional algorithmic information beyond its boundary. We express this as a one-dimensional computational area law: there exists a simulation in which the information capacity of the active \"holographic screen'' needed to generate a spacetime region of volume $t$ is bounded by $O(\\sqrt{t})$.

Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features.

Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories.

We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u51b0\u76d6\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u5b50\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51b0\u76d6\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u5168\u573a\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u9760\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training.

While foundational, existing models like SpecTTTra falter when faced with the diverse and rapidly advancing ecosystem of new generators, exhibiting significant performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) content. This generalization failure highlights a critical gap: the need for more challenging benchmarks and more robust detection architectures. To address this, we first introduce Melody or Machine (MoM), a new large-scale benchmark of over 130,000 songs (6,665 hours). MoM is the most diverse dataset to date, built with a mix of open and closed-source models and a curated OOD test set designed specifically to foster the development of truly generalizable detectors. Alongside this benchmark, we introduce CLAM, a novel dual-stream detection architecture. We hypothesize that subtle, machine-induced inconsistencies between vocal and instrumental elements, often imperceptible in a mixed signal, offer a powerful tell-tale sign of synthesis. CLAM is designed to test this hypothesis by employing two distinct pre-trained audio encoders (MERT and Wave2Vec2) to create parallel representations of the audio. These representations are fused by a learnable cross-aggregation module that models their inter-dependencies. The model is trained with a dual-loss objective: a standard binary cross-entropy loss for classification, complemented by a contrastive triplet loss which trains the model to distinguish between coherent and artificially mismatched stream pairings, enhancing its sensitivity to synthetic artifacts without presuming a simple feature alignment.

A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset.

In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient.

However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment.

INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy.

This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \\textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference.

When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information.

In this setting, decomposition acts as a \"surgical\" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as \"rehab\" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications.

These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines.

We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment.

To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre-train, then post-train\" curriculum.

Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing \"cat\" with \"dog\"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance.

Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage.

Building on and extending current research from a software engineering perspective, we systematically evaluate the scale, development costs, code quality, as well as security and dependencies of modern malware. We further introduce a multi-view genealogy analysis to clarify malware connections: at an overall view, this analysis quantifies the strength and direction of connections among specimens and categories; at a detailed view, it traces the evolutionary histories of individual specimens. Experimental results indicate that, despite persistent shortcomings in code quality, malware specimens exhibit an increasing complexity and standardization, in step with the development of mainstream software engineering practices.

To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image.

We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization.

Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability.

Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data.

Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold.

It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes.

Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy.

By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines.

This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks.

This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate.

To ensure methodological integrity and prevent data leakage, we employed specimen-level data splitting, resulting in 109,617 high-quality 2D slices (44,103 for training, 14,046 for validation, and 51,468 for testing). We evaluated seven state-of-the-art 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using transfer learning. Our final ensemble model, combining ConvNeXt-Large and EfficientNetV2-Small, achieved a test accuracy of 95.64%, with a top-3 accuracy of 99.6% and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.998 across all species.

This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts.

However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.\n  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.\n  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the \"what,\" \"how,\" and \"why\" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors.

One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \\textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot.

However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios.

Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM.

This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bDecoder - DeepONet (DDON) \u89e3\u51b3\u9006EFISH\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528IG\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u6b64\u524d\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u9006EFISH\u95ee\u9898\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f15\u5165\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u6784\u5efaDDON\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Integrated Gradients (IG) \u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "DDON\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "DDON\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f74\u7684\u201c\u949f\u5f62\u201d\u7535\u573a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u3002"}}

Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical outcomes. We propose a semantic-aware medical image reconstruction framework that integrates high-level latent embeddings with a hybrid U-Net architecture to preserve clinically relevant structures during restoration.

However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases.

Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecdGoAgentNet\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u63016G\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u66b4\u9732\u6216\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u667a\u80fd\u9002\u5e946G\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8de8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u6392\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a6G\u573a\u666f\u5c55\u793aGoAgentNet\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff1b\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0GoAgentNet\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad899%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad872%\u3002", "conclusion": "GoAgentNet\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u76846G\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce \"semantic confusion,\" a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u8fd9\u4e00\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaParaGuard\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6807\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62d2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaParaGuard\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5168\u5c40\u8bef\u62d2\u7387\u63a9\u76d6\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u611f\u77e5\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u62d2\u7edd\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62d2\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters.

We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks.

However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance.

While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term \"social degradation,\" whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model.

The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases.

We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(\u0394t) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(\u0394t^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u968f\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84\u7a7a\u95f4KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDPAC\u89c4\u5219\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5f97\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5207\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u6d88\u9664Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684O(\u0394t)\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0O(\u0394t^2)\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f97\u5206\u6216\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1DPAC\u5728\u5339\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FID\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8def\u5f84KL\u6563\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks.

Traditional annotation techniques are labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling post data collection. This paper presents a novel real-time annotation approach leveraging YOLO models deployed on edge devices, enabling immediate labeling during image capture. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed system, we conducted an extensive comparative analysis using three prominent YOLO architectures (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv12) under various configurations: single-class versus multi-class annotation and pretrained versus scratch-based training. Our analysis includes detailed statistical tests and learning dynamics, demonstrating significant advantages of pretrained and single-class configurations in terms of model convergence, performance, and robustness.

Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering.

In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three \"thinking intervention\" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6IntentGuard\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u65e0\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e14\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efaIntentGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u201c\u601d\u7ef4\u5e72\u9884\u201d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9664\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u5916\u65e0\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5728Mind2Web\u573a\u666f\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece100%\u964d\u81f38.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "IntentGuard\u662f\u5e94\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u901a\u7528\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a \"generalist\" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.\n  Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.\n  Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528ANNE One\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u8bca\u65ad\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528ANNE One\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u969c\u788d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u83b7\u53d6384\u540d\u6210\u5e74\u4ebaPSG\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8PSG\u547c\u5438\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u7528PSG\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AHI\u4e0ePSG\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d7\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548ckappa\u503c\uff0c\u572830\u79d2\u65f6\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bAHI\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7761\u7720\u547c\u5438\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u751f\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u521b\u5efa\u4eff\u751f\u6570\u5b57\u9cdf\u9c7c\uff0c\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f74\u5411\u808c\u8282\u8026\u5408\u3001\u9002\u5ea6\u808c\u8089\u6536\u7f29\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u6e38\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4eff\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u6c34\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7a76\u9cb9\u79d1\u9c7c\u7c7b\u6e38\u6cf3\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001Hill\u578b\u808c\u8089\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6d41\u56fa\u8026\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u6570\u5b57\u9cdf\u9c7c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8f74\u5411\u808c\u8282\u8026\u5408\uff08\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8de8\u8d8a\u8d85\u8fc70.5\u4e2a\u4f53\u957f\uff09\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u8eab\u4f53\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u9002\u5ea6\u808c\u8089\u6536\u7f29\u65f6\u957f\uff08\u5c3e\u62cd\u5468\u671f\u7684[0.1,0.3]\uff09\u53ef\u4f7f\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u5f62\u6210\u88ab\u52a8\u963b\u5c3c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff1b\u808c\u8282\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ede\u540e\u5f71\u54cd\u8eab\u4f53\u6ce2\uff0c\u8fc7\u5927\u5219\u963b\u788d\u63a8\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u8fdb\u5bf9\u4eff\u751f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u8282\u80fd\u6c34\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets.

These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCALM\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u4f55\u65f6\u901a\u4fe1\u51b3\u7b56\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u672a\u5229\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u6c89\u9ed8\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCALM\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f55\u65f6\u901a\u4fe1\u53ca\u4ece\u901a\u4fe1\u6c89\u9ed8\u671f\u63a8\u65ad\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0cCALM\u80fd\u89e3\u7801\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u95f4\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u201c\u6c89\u9ed8\u201d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "CALM\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNOHARM\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u533b\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u5371\u5bb3\u7387\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u660e\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5371\u5bb3\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528100\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u521d\u8bca\u8f6c\u4e13\u79d1\u54a8\u8be2\u6848\u4f8b\u6784\u5efaNOHARM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u4e2a\u4e13\u79d1\uff0c\u670912747\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "31\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u5371\u5bb3\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe22.2%\uff0c\u9057\u6f0f\u5371\u5bb3\u536076.6%\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u9002\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u6709\u5bb3\u533b\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u662f\u9700\u660e\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u80fd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth.

A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community.

However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety.

We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules).

Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures.

The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size.

Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions.

Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7ea0\u7f20\uff08MIE\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30MIE\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u540e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bMIE\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MIE\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ee5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u9884\u6d4bMIE\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8fd1\u90bb\u8026\u5408\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5c0f\u4e14\u968f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u9608\u503c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5927\uff1b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60MIE\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5176\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as \"(@_@)\" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u5fae\u5c0f\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u7b26\u53f7\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u707e\u96be\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9EmoRAG\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u51fa\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(\u03b5^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $\u03b1$/$\u03b2$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\\tilde{O}(\u03b1^{-1}\\n_+^{-1} + \u03b2^{-1}\\n_-^{-1})$.

This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories.

In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6PromptBridge\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u9891\u7e41\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u540e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6548\u679c\u53d8\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptBridge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7MAP - RPE\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u518d\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPromptBridge\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc1\u79fb\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptBridge\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility.

For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels.

Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 \"Pick Apple to Bowl\" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1.

Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.\n  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise.

Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DFS\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aDFS\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u7cca\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DFS\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u94fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u8c03\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u96b6\u5c5e\u5ea6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cDFS\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "DFS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBlinkBud\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u8033\u8033\u673a\u548c\u624b\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u65b9\u5371\u9669\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u6d88\u9664\u5934\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u4e0e\u9a91\u884c\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bdf\u89c9\u540e\u65b9\u6765\u8f66\u4f1a\u5a01\u80c1\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u65b9\u5371\u9669\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8033\u9ea6\u5c11\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u51c6\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba13D\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u548c\u504f\u822a\u89d2\u5206\u522b\u6821\u6b63\u7269\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "BlinkBud\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f7b\u91cf\uff0c\u8033\u9ea6\u548c\u624b\u673a\u5e73\u5747\u529f\u8017\u5206\u522b\u4e3a29.8 mW\u548c702.6 mW\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u548c\u6f0f\u62a5\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a4.90%\u548c1.47%\u3002", "conclusion": "BlinkBud\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u65b9\u5371\u9669\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u529f\u8017\u4f4e\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002"}}

Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability.

While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding \"in-between\" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7Transformer\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u6846\u67b6MSM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7b26\u53f7\u6837\u672c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u5e26\u6ce2\u5f62\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u8c03\u5c55\u793a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6709\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMasked Symbol Modeling (MSM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u7b26\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7528Transformer\u6839\u636e\u5468\u56f4\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f3a\u5931\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u5c06MSM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u89e3\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u65ad\u53d7\u635f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models.

In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research.

If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFlexQP\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884cQP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aDeep FlexQP\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3aQP\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u597d\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eQP\u7ea6\u675f\u7cbe\u786e\u677e\u5f1b\u63d0\u51faFlexQP\uff0c\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aDeep FlexQP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PAC Bayes\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a0\u901f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "FlexQP\u548cDeep FlexQP\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002"}}

Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.

To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas.

An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC.

To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting.

Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples.

Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks.

While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop.

Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u8840\u538b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8896\u5e26\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u57fa\u4e8ePPG\u548cECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7ecf\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u5934\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8840\u538b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u538b\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee3.60 mmHg\uff0c\u8212\u5f20\u538b\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee3.01 mmHg\uff1b\u7b26\u5408\u82f1\u56fd\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u534f\u4f1a\u534f\u8baeA\u7ea7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7f8e\u56fd\u533b\u7597\u4eea\u5668\u4fc3\u8fdb\u534f\u4f1a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u516d\u6a21\u6001\u8840\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8840\u538b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8eCCA\u7684ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94RMDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "CCAs\u7684ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709RMDP\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u98de\u673a\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u96c6\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u540d\u4e49\u548c\u9759\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u66b4\u9732\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u53ef\u4fe1\u96c6\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency.

By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LAWNs\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u7a00\u758f\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4f4e\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7531\u4e13\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u6839\u636e\u77ac\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u914d\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7a00\u758fMoE\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728LAWNs\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5178\u578bISAC\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728LAWNs\u7684ISAC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction.

There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations.

To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot.

In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution.

These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6b20\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRePro\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8fc7\u957f\u7b49\u6b20\u4f73\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u89c6\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRePro\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u53cc\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRePro\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6b20\u4f73\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "RePro\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6b20\u4f73\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize.

Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer.

To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example.

However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes.

However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation.

However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVisualSync\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u624b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u786c\u4ef6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684VisualSync\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u62103D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6781\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cVisualSync\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e50ms\u3002", "conclusion": "VisualSync\u80fd\u4ee5\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u672a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u672a\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories.
