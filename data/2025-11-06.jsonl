This paper formalizes ETLT and ELTL as reusable design patterns by\ncodifying implicit best practices and introduces enhanced variants, ETLT++ and\nELTL++, to address persistent gaps in governance, quality assurance, and\nobservability. We define ETLT and ELTL patterns systematically within a design\npattern framework, outlining their structure, trade-offs, and use cases.\nBuilding on this foundation, we extend them into ETLT++ and ELTL++ by embedding\nexplicit contracts, versioning, semantic curation, and continuous monitoring as\nmandatory design obligations. The proposed framework offers practitioners a\nstructured roadmap to build auditable, scalable, and cost-efficient pipelines,\nunifying quality enforcement, lineage, and usability across multi-cloud and\nreal-time contexts.

Existing\ngenerative models often impose artificial gene orderings or rely on shallow\nneural network architectures. We introduce a scalable latent diffusion model\nfor single-cell gene expression data, which we refer to as scLDM, that respects\nthe fundamental exchangeability property of the data. Our VAE uses fixed-size\nlatent variables leveraging a unified Multi-head Cross-Attention Block (MCAB)\narchitecture, which serves dual roles: permutation-invariant pooling in the\nencoder and permutation-equivariant unpooling in the decoder. We enhance this\nframework by replacing the Gaussian prior with a latent diffusion model using\nDiffusion Transformers and linear interpolants, enabling high-quality\ngeneration with multi-conditional classifier-free guidance. We show its\nsuperior performance in a variety of experiments for both observational and\nperturbational single-cell data, as well as downstream tasks like cell-level\nclassification."}

At first glance, this lower\nbound appears to rule out any algorithm more efficient than the naive approach\nof sorting $I$ and comparing adjacent elements. However, upon closer\ninspection, the $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ bound does not apply if the input has many\nduplicates. We therefore ask: Are there comparison-based lower bounds for\nelement distinctness that are sensitive to the amount of duplicates in the\ninput?\n  To address this question, we derive instance-specific lower bounds. For any\ninput instance $I$, we represent the combinatorial structure of the duplicates\nin $I$ by an undirected graph $G(I)$ that connects identical elements. Each\nsuch graph $G$ is a union of cliques, and we study algorithms by their\nworst-case running time over all inputs $I'$ with $G(I') \\cong G$.

We provide the following\ndynamic version of their kernel: Our data structure is initialized with an\n$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ in $O(n \\log n)$ amortized time, and, at\ninitialization, outputs a planar graph $K$ with $\\mathrm{OPT}(K) =\n\\mathrm{OPT}(G)$ and $|K| = O(\\mathrm{OPT}(G))$, where $\\mathrm{OPT}(\\cdot)$\ndenotes the size of a minimum dominating set. The graph $G$ can be updated by\ninsertions and deletions of edges and isolated vertices in $O(\\log n)$\namortized time per update, under the promise that it remains planar.

The\nresearch builds upon a previous matrix interpolation method applied on top of a\nCraig-Bampton modal reduction, allowing the variations of geometrical features\nwithout the need to remesh and recompute Finite Element matrices. This existing\nprocedure has significant limitations since it requires a common modal\nprojection, which inherently restricts the allowable perturbation size of the\nmodel parameters, thereby limiting the model parameter space where matrices can\nbe effectively interpolated. The present work offers three contributions: (1)\nIt provides structural dynamic insight into the restrictions imposed by the\ncommon modal projection, demonstrating that ill-conditioning can be controlled,\n(2) it proposes an efficient, sampling-based procedure to identify the\nnon-regular boundaries of the usable region in the model parameter space, and\n(3) it enhances the surrogate model to accommodate larger model parameter\nperturbations by proposing a multi-region interpolation strategy. The efficacy\nof this proposed framework is verified through two illustrative examples. The\nfirst example, involving a unit cell with a square plate and circular core,\nvalidates the approach for a single well-conditioned projection region. The\nsecond example, using a beam-like structure with vibration attenuation bands,\ndemonstrates the true advantage of the multi-region approach, where predictions\nfrom traditional Lagrange interpolation deviated significantly with increasing\nperturbations, while the proposed method maintained high accuracy across\ndifferent perturbation levels."}

Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional\nLLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code\nquality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for\nspecific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving\ncontexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and\nexecuting workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based\nagents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce\nRefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software\nrefactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%.

Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space.

To rigorously\nevaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama\nbenchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per\nsubject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity.\nExperimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over\nNef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The\ncode and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication."}

While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,\nour framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with\nstatistical validity."}

To address these limitations, we propose\nOMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,\nMethod, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,\nand structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style\nsummarization module converts raw papers into structured and\ndiscourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives\nalign semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.\nThe final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through\ncontextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly\nconstructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in\nPrecision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that\nQA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete\nrepresentations.

Prior work has uncovered\nparallels between these families and applied empirical normalization or\nchance-correction schemes, but their deeper analytical connection remains only\npartially understood.

Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions.

To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy.

The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model.

In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare\nthe constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the\nlarge-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the\nConditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their\nsensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our\nanalysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations\nat redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework\nimplemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the\nQuijote simulations $(\\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\\,\\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the\nsmoothing scale $R=15\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter\nforecasts for $(\\Omega_{m}},\\,\\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs\ncomponents, improving the constraint precision by ${\\sim}(44\\%,\\,52\\%)$,\n${\\sim}(30\\%,\\,45\\%)$, ${\\sim}(27\\%,\\,17\\%)$, and ${\\sim}(26\\%,\\,17\\%)$,\nrespectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances\nthe precision by approximately ${\\sim}27\\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone,\nhighlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the\nCMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We\nfurther extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological\nparameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although\nthe absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics\ndepends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the\nrelative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly\nconstant throughout."}

We show an equivalence between properties that are efficiently\ntestable from few samples and properties with structured symmetry, which depend\nonly on the function's average values on parts of a low-complexity partition of\nthe domain. Without the efficiency constraint, a similar characterization in\nterms of unstructured symmetry was obtained by Blais and Yoshida (2019). Our\nmain technical tool is supersimulation, which builds on methods from the\nalgorithmic fairness literature to approximate arbitrarily complex functions by\nsmall-circuit simulators that fool significantly larger distinguishers.\n  We extend the characterization along other axes as well. We show that\nallowing parts to overlap exponentially reduces their required number,\nbroadening the scope of the construction from properties testable with $O(\\log\nn)$ samples to properties testable with $O(n)$ samples. For larger sample\nsizes, we show that any efficient tester is essentially checking for\nindistinguishability from a bounded collection of small circuits, in the spirit\nof a characterization of testable graph properties. Finally, we show that our\nresults for Boolean function testing generalize to high-entropy distribution\ntesting on arbitrary domains."}

While deep learning offers a path to\nautomation, centralized training models conflict with data governance\nregulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)\nframework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature\nlearning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a\ndual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear\ndetail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a\nrobust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across\nheterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation\non the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall\naccuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%).\nCrucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III\ntumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent\ndangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher\nmagnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our\nfederated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also\nenhances model performance and generalization. The proposed modular pipeline,\nwith built-in preprocessing, checkpointing, and error handling, establishes a\nfoundational step toward deployable, privacy-aware clinical AI for digital\npathology."}

To capture the statistical price\nof this ignorance, we introduce the regret inflation criterion, defined as the\nratio between the regret of an adaptive algorithm and that of an oracle knowing\n$\\alpha$. We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomial with the\nhorizon $T$, with exponent precisely given by the value of a convex\noptimization problem involving the dimension, smoothness, and batch budget.\nMoreover, the minimizers of this optimization problem directly prescribe the\nbatch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm. Building\non this principle, we develop RoBIN (RObust batched algorithm with adaptive\nBINning), which achieves the optimal regret inflation up to logarithmic\nfactors. These results reveal a new adaptivity barrier: under batching,\nadaptation to an unknown margin parameter inevitably incurs a polynomial\npenalty, sharply characterized by a variational problem. Remarkably, this\nbarrier vanishes when the number of batches exceeds $\\log \\log T$; with only a\ndoubly logarithmic number of updates, one can recover the oracle regret rate up\nto polylogarithmic factors."}
