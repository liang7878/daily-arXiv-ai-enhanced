This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u601d\u8003AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u5a01\u80c1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u6545\u4e8b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3001\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u5e76\u4f30\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u88abAI\u6bc1\u706d\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728ChatGPT\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6784\u6210\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790AI\u5a01\u80c1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u7528\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u540c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u636e\u6b64\u4f30\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u88abAI\u6bc1\u706d\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u601d\u8003AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u5b58\u6545\u4e8b\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u5bf9\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGUI - Eyes\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eGUI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u3001\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u5bdf\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u8c03\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScreenSpot - Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGUI - Eyes - 3B\u75283k\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b044.8%\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u5065\u58ee\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities.

Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance.

This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes.

We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR->DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.\n  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR->DPO) are released for reproducibility.

Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes.

Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads.

As algorithms are increasingly used in decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it is becoming crucial to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. Recent work has addressed the challenge of developing efficient approximation algorithms for fair matroid submodular maximization. However, the best algorithms known so far are only guaranteed to satisfy a relaxed version of the fairness constraints that loses a factor 2, i.e., the problem may ask for $\\ell$ elements with a given attribute, but the algorithm is only guaranteed to find $\\lfloor \\ell/2 \\rfloor$. In particular, there is no provable guarantee when $\\ell=1$, which corresponds to a key special case of perfect matching constraints.\n  In this work, we achieve a new trade-off via an algorithm that gets arbitrarily close to full fairness. Namely, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, we give a constant-factor approximation to fair monotone matroid submodular maximization that in expectation loses only a factor $(1-\\varepsilon)$ in the lower-bound fairness constraint.

To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth.

We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\\%$ in urban environments.

It is imperative to understand the direction fishers change their behavior before implementing new policies as fisheries are vulnerable to overfishing. We provide the first theoretical application of index insurance on fisher's behavior change to predict if index insurance will incentivize higher or lower harvests in unregulated settings. We find that using traditional fishery models with production variability only originating through stock abundance leads fishers to increase harvest with index insurance. However, fishers are adaptable and experience multiple sources of risk. Using a more flexible specification of production shows that index insurance could raise or lower harvest depending on the risk mitigation strategies available for fishers and the design of the insurance contract. We demonstrate the magnitude of potential change by simulating from parameters estimated for three Norwegian fisheries. Fisheries with index insurance contracts protecting extraction risks may increase harvest by 10% or decrease by 2% depending on the risk effects of inputs. Insurance contracts protecting stock risk will lead to 6-20% increases in harvest. Before widespread adoption, careful consideration must be given to how index insurance will incentivize or disincentivize overfishing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u5bf9\u6e14\u6c11\u6355\u635e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6e14\u6c11\u6355\u635e\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u524d\u9700\u6743\u8861\u5bf9\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6355\u635e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e14\u4e1a\u6613\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u867d\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6e14\u6c11\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6e14\u4e1a\u6613\u53d7\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6355\u635e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u6e14\u6c11\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u5728\u6e14\u6c11\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u6e14\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u8303\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u632a\u5a01\u6e14\u4e1a\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6e14\u6c11\u4f1a\u56e0\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u6355\u635e\uff1b\u7075\u6d3b\u89c4\u8303\u4e0b\u6355\u635e\u91cf\u589e\u51cf\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6e14\u6c11\u98ce\u9669\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5408\u540c\u4f7f\u6355\u635e\u91cf\u589e\u51cf\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u79cd\u7fa4\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5408\u540c\u4f7f\u6355\u635e\u589e\u52a06 - 20%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u5e7f\u6307\u6570\u4fdd\u9669\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u5176\u5bf9\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6355\u635e\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u6216\u6291\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Simulation study of importance sampling and discrete moment matching for Value-at-Risk under tail misspecification", "summary": "Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation at high confidence levels is inherently a rare-event problem and is particularly sensitive to tail behavior and model misspecification. This paper studies the performance of two simulation-based VaR estimation approaches, importance sampling and discrete moment matching, under controlled tail misspecification. The analysis separates the nominal model used for estimator construction from the true data-generating process used for evaluation, allowing the effects of heavy-tailed returns to be examined in a transparent and reproducible setting. Daily returns of a broad equity market proxy are used to calibrate a nominal Gaussian model, while true returns are generated from Student-t distributions with varying degrees of freedom to represent increasingly heavy tails. Importance sampling is implemented via exponential tilting of the Gaussian model, and VaR is estimated through likelihood-weighted root-finding. Discrete moment matching constructs deterministic lower and upper VaR bounds by enforcing a finite number of moment constraints on a discretized loss distribution. The results demonstrate a clear trade-off between efficiency and robustness. Importance sampling produces low-variance VaR estimates under the nominal model but systematically underestimates the true VaR under heavy-tailed returns, with bias increasing at higher confidence levels and for thicker tails. In contrast, discrete moment matching yields conservative VaR bracketing that remains robust under tail misspecification. These findings highlight that variance reduction alone is insufficient for reliable tail risk estimation when model uncertainty is significant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684VaR\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "VaR\u5728\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7528\u80a1\u5e02\u65e5\u56de\u62a5\u6821\u51c6\u540d\u4e49\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684Student - t\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u56de\u62a5\uff1b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u6570\u503e\u659c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\u65bd\u52a0\u6709\u9650\u77e9\u7ea6\u675f\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u5728\u540d\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u65b9\u5deeVaR\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u56de\u62a5\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f4e\u4f30\u771f\u5b9eVaR\uff1b\u79bb\u6563\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u4ea7\u751f\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684VaR\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

There is also literature for estimating the unknown bounds for known parent distributions. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm under the expectation-solution (ES) framework, which is an iterative method of solving nonlinear estimating equations, to estimate both the bounds and the location and scale parameters of the parent normal distribution utilizing the theory of best linear unbiased estimates from location-scale families of distribution and unbiased minimum variance estimation of truncation regions. The conditions for the algorithm to converge to the solution of the estimating equations for a fixed sample size are discussed, and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are characterized using results on M- and Z-estimation from empirical process theory. The proposed method is then compared to methods utilizing the known truncation bounds via Monte Carlo simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u622a\u65ad\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u622a\u65ad\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u622a\u65ad\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u622a\u65ad\u533a\u57df\u6216\u5df2\u77e5\u6bcd\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u53ca\u6bcd\u4f53\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u671f\u671b - \u89e3\uff08ES\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e - \u5c3a\u5ea6\u65cf\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d M - \u548c Z - \u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u622a\u65ad\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

It is parametrized by a correlation scale $T$, marginal-specific intermittency parameters and Hurst exponents, as well as their multidimensional counterparts: the co-intermittency matrix and the co-Hurst matrix. The mLog S-fBM is constructed by modeling volatility components as exponentials of the mS-fBM, preserving the dependence structure of the Gaussian core. We demonstrate that the model is well-defined for any co-Hurst matrix with entries in $[0, \\frac{1}{2}[$, supporting vanishing co-Hurst parameters to bridge rough volatility and multifractal regimes.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the network latency associated with the block propagation throughout of the underlying peer-to-peer network, typically formed through random connections. Accelerating the dissemination of blocks not only improves transaction rates, but also enhances system security by reducing the probability of forks. This paper introduces SCRamble: a decentralized protocol that significantly reduces block dissemination time in blockchain networks.

For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the \"big data\" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.\n  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%.

While data ingestion and storage capabilities have matured significantly, enterprises continue to face systemic challenges in governing IoT data at scale. These challenges are not rooted in tooling limitations but in the absence of a governance model that aligns with the realities of distributed operational ownership, heterogeneous source systems, and continuous change at the edge. This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations. The model addresses governance enforcement at architectural boundaries, enabling semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without requiring centralized control of operational technology systems.

We demonstrate that while Sobolev regularization is the fastest method in our implementation, it produces slightly less faithful denoised meshes than the best results obtained with iterative filtering or heat diffusion.

Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.\n  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

An enhanced version was accepted for oral presentation at the AI for Time Series Analysis Workshop at AAAI 2026", "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProbFM\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684ProbFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u56de\u5f52\uff08DER\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bc1\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u53d6\u6700\u4f18\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027LSTM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u56de\u62a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cDER\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DER\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning.

To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost.

While capstones are widely used in engineering education, existing analyses typically treat stakeholder behavior informally or descriptively, leaving incentive conflicts, information asymmetries, and strategic dependencies underexplored. This paper develops a formal game-theoretic framework that models capstone projects as a sequential Bayesian game involving three players: the university, the industry sponsor, and the student team. The framework is intended as an analytical and explanatory tool for understanding how institutional policy choices, such as grading structures, intellectual property rules, and sponsor engagement expectations, shape stakeholder behavior and project outcomes, rather than as a calibrated or predictive model. The university acts as a constrained Stackelberg leader by committing to course policies and assessment structures while anticipating strategic responses by sponsors and students under incomplete information. Reduced-form outcome functions capture technical quality, documentation quality, timeliness, alignment with sponsor needs, and publishability, while payoff functions reflect stakeholder-specific objectives and costs. Under standard assumptions, the model admits stable equilibrium regimes that correspond to empirically recognizable capstone dynamics observed in practice, including cooperative engagement, sponsor-dominated exploitation, and student grade gaming.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound.

However, link-cut trees cannot support parallel batch-dynamic updates and have limitations on the kinds of queries they support.\n  In this paper, we design a new parallel batch-dynamic trees data structure called UFO trees that simultaneously supports a wide range of query functionality, supports work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic updates, and is competitive with link-cut trees when run sequentially. We prove that a key reason for the strong practical performance of both link-cut trees and UFO trees is that they can perform updates and queries in sub-logarithmic time for low-diameter trees. We perform an experimental study of our optimized C++ implementations of UFO trees with ten other dynamic tree implementations, several of which are new, in a broad benchmark of both synthetic and real-world trees of varying diameter and size. Our results show that, in both sequential and parallel settings, UFO trees are the fastest dynamic tree data structure that supports a wide range of queries.

We identify the lack of {\\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness.

We find that, across sectors, inventor networks are denser and more clustered than organization ones - consistent with the presence of small recurrent teams embedded into broader institutional hierarchies - whereas organization networks have neater hierarchical role-based structures, with few bridging firms coordinating the most peripheral ones. We also find that the discovered meso-structures are connected to innovation output. In particular, Lorenz curves of forward citations show a pervasive inequality in technological influence: across sectors and methods, both inventor (especially) and organization networks consistently show high levels of concentration of citations in a few of the discovered clusters.

However, performance models that are simple yet sufficiently expressive to predict runtime on actual neuromorphic hardware are lacking, posing a challenge for researchers and developers who strive to design fast algorithms and kernels. As breaking the memory bandwidth wall of conventional von-Neumann architectures is a primary neuromorphic advantage, modeling communication time is especially important. At the same time, modeling communication time is difficult, as complex congestion patterns arise in a heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip. In this work, we introduce the first max-affine lower-bound runtime model -- a multi-dimensional roofline model -- for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that quantitatively accounts for both compute and communication based on a suite of microbenchmarks. Despite being a lower-bound model, we observe a tight correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.97) between our model's estimated runtime and the measured runtime on Loihi 2 for a neural network linear layer, i.e., matrix-vector multiplication, and for an example application, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization solver. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for communication-bottlenecked runtime to study scalability of the linear layer, revealing an area-runtime tradeoff for different spatial workload configurations with linear to superliner runtime scaling in layer size with a variety of constant factors.

However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches.

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment.

We propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework for the calibration and selection of constitutive models for yield stress fluids, explicitly accounting for uncertainties in both modeling accuracy and experimental observations. The framework addresses the challenge of complex flow modeling by making discrepancies that emanate from rheological measurements explicit and quantifiable. We apply the Bayesian framework to rheological measurements and squeeze flow experiments on Carbopol 980. Our analysis demonstrates that Bayesian model selection yields robust probabilistic predictions and provides an objective assessment of model suitability through evaluated plausibilities. The framework naturally penalizes unnecessary complexity and shows that the optimal model choice depends on the incorporated physics, the prior information, and the availability of data. In rheological settings, the Herschel-Bulkley and biviscous power law models perform well. However, when these rheological outcomes are used as prior information for a rheo-informed squeeze flow analysis, a significant mismatch with the experimental data is observed. This is due to the yield stress inferred from rheological measurements not being representative of the complex squeeze flow case. In contrast, an expert-informed squeeze flow analysis, based on broader priors, yields accurate predictions. These findings highlight the limitations of translating rheological measurements to complex flows and underscore the value of Bayesian approaches in quantifying model bias and guiding model selection under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u5c48\u670d\u5e94\u529b\u6d41\u4f53\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eCarbopol 980\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6d41\u53d8\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u53d8\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u4ee3\u8868\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u672c\u6784\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5c48\u670d\u5e94\u529b\u6d41\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u53d8\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6324\u538b\u6d41\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u6d41\u53d8\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\u7528\u4e8e\u6324\u538b\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6324\u538b\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u6d41\u53d8\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking).

MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMCEMOL\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4ea4\u53c9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8d77\u59cb\u5206\u5b50\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u5c42\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u548c\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "MCEMOL\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7c7b\u836f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "MCEMOL\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, scientific workflows impose strict requirements on reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, which are not satisfied by generic LLM-based agents. Unconstrained action generation can lead to silent state changes, non-deterministic executions, and irreproducible experimental results, limiting the applicability of LAMs in scientific settings.\n  In this paper, we propose R-LAM, a reproducibility-constrained framework for applying Large Action Models to scientific workflow automation. R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and explicit provenance tracking to ensure that every action and intermediate artifact is auditable and replayable. The framework supports failure-aware execution loops and controlled workflow forking, enabling iterative experimentation without compromising reproducibility.\n  We implement R-LAM as a lightweight Python framework and release it as an open-source PyPI package to facilitate reproducible research.

Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\u03b1_{LE}\\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\u03b1\\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\u03ba\\approx 1.2385\\sqrt{\\frac{\u03b1_a}{-\\log\\left ( \u03b1_a \\right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4e2d\u7edf\u8ba1 - \u8ba1\u7b97\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u9608\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u9608\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4e2d\u7edf\u8ba1 - \u8ba1\u7b97\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdfc - \u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5982\u89c4\u8303SBP\u7684\u03b1_c\u548c\u03b1_a\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u591a\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e8c\u5143\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u5c06\u5176\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f53\u6027AI\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u652f\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5c40\u9650\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u76ca\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f53\u6027AI\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u4e3b\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u6839\u636eAI\u652f\u6301\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small.

Building on a prior theoretical contribution that identified fifteen principles of urban antifragility, this paper tests and operationalizes the framework through an empirical assessment of 26 cities selected for their post-crisis adaptation trajectories. Using a tailored diagnostic methodology, we benchmark cities' Stress Response Strategies (SRS) and then evaluate Urban Development Trajectories (UDT) across four weighted dimensions, positioning each case along a fragility-robustness-resilience-antifragility continuum and applying a balanced-threshold rule to confirm antifragile status. Results show that \"resilience enhanced by innovation and technology\" is the most effective response typology (86.9/100), and that six cities meet the antifragile trajectory criteria. By mapping best practices to activated principles and analysing co-activations, the study identifies a robust \"hard core\" of principles - Sustainable Resilience (O), Strategic Diversity (F), Proactive Innovation (I), and Active Prevention (N) - supplemented by operational enablers (e.g., anticipation, mobilization, shock absorption). The paper concludes by proposing an evidence-based, SDG-aligned operational model that links high-impact principle pairings to measurable indicators, offering a practical roadmap for cities seeking to convert crises into sustained transformation.

For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services.

We frame this setting as transfer learning under label (prior) shift between an imbalanced source distribution induced by the observed data and a balanced target distribution under which performance is evaluated. Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general. We corroborate these findings with experimental evidence.

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption.

In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery.

Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \\textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set.

Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies.

While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative.

While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u6709\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa PACEvolve \u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 PACEvolve \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u9003\u79bb\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "PACEvolve \u5728 LLM - SR \u548c KernelBench \u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728 Modded NanoGPT \u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaa\u5f55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "PACEvolve \u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u3001\u957f\u671f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In copy number variant (CNV) detection from NGS, many algorithms compare read depth between test samples and a reference sample, assuming they are process-matched. When this assumption is violated, with causes ranging from reagent lot changes to multi-site processing, the reference becomes inappropriate, introducing false CNV calls or masking true pathogenic variants. Detecting such heterogeneity before downstream analysis is critical for reliable clinical interpretation. Existing batch effect detection methods either cluster samples based on raw features, risking conflation of biological signal with technical variation, or require known batch labels that are frequently unavailable. We introduce a method that addresses both limitations by clustering samples according to their Bayesian model evidence. The central insight is that evidence quantifies compatibility between data and model assumptions, technical artifacts violate assumptions and reduce evidence, whereas biological variation, including CNV status, is anticipated by the model and yields high evidence. This asymmetry provides a discriminative signal that separates batch effects from biology. We formalize heterogeneity detection as a likelihood ratio test for mixture structure in evidence space, using parametric bootstrap calibration to ensure conservative false positive rates. We validate our approach on synthetic data demonstrating proper Type I error control, three clinical targeted sequencing panels (liquid biopsy, BRCA, and thalassemia) exhibiting distinct batch effect mechanisms, and mouse electrophysiology recordings demonstrating cross-modality generalization.

However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes.

However, vast documentation heterogeneity and drift over time challenge harmonization of document metadata.

This scoping review aims to catalog research on clinical document metadata extraction, identify methodological trends and applications, and highlight gaps. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to identify articles that perform clinical document metadata extraction. We initially found and screened 266 articles published between January 2011 and August 2025, then comprehensively reviewed 67 we deemed relevant to our study. Among the articles included, 45 were methodological, 17 used document metadata as features in a downstream application, and 5 analyzed document metadata composition. We observe myriad purposes for methodological study and application types. Available labelled public data remains sparse except for structural section datasets. Methods for extracting document metadata have progressed from largely rule-based and traditional machine learning with ample feature engineering to transformer-based architectures with minimal feature engineering. The emergence of large language models has enabled broader exploration of generalizability across tasks and datasets, allowing the possibility of advanced clinical text processing systems.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation. Experiments across financial, automotive, and power domains show that RAFT achieves expert-level performance, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while reducing overall generation and review time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u624b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51c0\u5316\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9690\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u79cd\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u7535\u529b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRAFT\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "RAFT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5408\u89c4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target \"fair\" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the \"fairness-accuracy\" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7ba1\u9053\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u5bf9\u2018\u516c\u5e73 - \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u2019\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u516c\u5e73\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u590d\u5236\u6216\u52a0\u5267\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u504f\u5dee\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5b9a\u533b\u7597\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u2018\u516c\u5e73\u2019\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u2018\u516c\u5e73 - \u51c6\u786e\u7387\u2019\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u679c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u95f4\u63a5\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u533b\u7597\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan.

Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eGPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528GPTQ\u91cf\u5316\uff0cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u62b5\u6297\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Before acting, the learner observes $\\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments.

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}.

Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u67901036\u4e2aGitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u5f00\u6e90Java\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u53ca\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8Java\u9879\u76ee\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u7ef4\u62a4\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67901036\u4e2aGitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u5f00\u6e90Java\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u6bcf\u6708\u8ddf\u8e2a\u90e8\u5206\u6d3b\u8dc3\u4ed3\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u4ed3\u5e93\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0cJavadoc\u548c\u547d\u540d\u8fdd\u89c4\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u8fdd\u53cdGoogle Java\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u5357\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u88ab\u73b0\u4ee3\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u9057\u6f0f\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u9075\u5faa\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u6574\u4f53\u9075\u5b88\u60c5\u51b5\u7565\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faProPer\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7531DGA\u548cRGA\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u591a\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u95ee\u7b54\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7531DGA\u548cRGA\u7ec4\u6210\u7684ProPer\u67b6\u6784\uff0cDGA\u751f\u6210\u9690\u5f0f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\uff0cRGA\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "ProPer\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534784%\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5360\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "ProPer\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation.

However, in a large lecture hall, students can easily get bored, distracted, and disengaged. The frontal setting can also frustrate lecturers since interaction opportunities are limited and hard to scale. Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row.

However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer.

For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4bJava\u9879\u76ee\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u5bf9\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4fa7\u91cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf930\u4e2aJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d9\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u7531\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5473\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u57289\u79cd\u5f02\u5473\u4e2d\u76845\u79cd\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u5473\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5bf9\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies.

We derive a novel characterization of the fair risk minimizer, which yields a computationally efficient estimation procedure for general loss functions. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator and derive its convergence rates under mild assumptions.

However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions.

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u6539\u5584F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u8bf4\u660e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5148\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u4e8c\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u53cd\u601d\u5e76\u505a\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u53cd\u601d\u4f7fF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53470.04 - 0.25\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u884c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u91cd\u53ec\u56de\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u6b21\u6279\u8bc4\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u633d\u6551\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002"}}

This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality.

Although substantial progress has been made on differentially private linear regression, existing methods almost exclusively address the item-level DP setting, where each user contributes a single observation. Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent.

We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure.

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes.

This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\u00f6s-Renyi and scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u5e42\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5e42\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff08\u4e8c\u5143\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u591a\u5c42\u5230\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8c\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u5e76\u7528 2 \u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5e42\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u6709\u5355\u8c03\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u80fd\u7528 2 \u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u91cd\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8868\u660e\u6700\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5e42\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data.

We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.\n  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\\%, yielding a mean 57.8\\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\\% in accuracy and 69.5\\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\\% and 46.1\\% in single language repositories.

With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528OpenRouter\u5e73\u53f0\u5206\u6790\u8d85100\u4e07\u4ebf\u771f\u5b9e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9762\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7406\u89e3\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528OpenRouter\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8d85100\u4e07\u4ebf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u7528\u3001\u521b\u610f\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u7c7b\u522b\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u65e9\u671f\u7528\u6237\u6301\u4e45\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u201c\u7070\u59d1\u5a18\u6548\u5e94\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u4e92\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9762\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u4e3aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively.

Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_\u03b8(H, \u03c4, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\\%/88\\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth.

Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMatrixCoT\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982CoT\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\uff0cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatrixCoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u3001\u9644\u52a0\u5f15\u7528\u5b57\u6bb5\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMatrixCoT\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MatrixCoT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines.

While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u548cSCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u53caAW\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u8d85\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u96be\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5e08\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5373\u5b66\u751f\u5728SFS\u4f18\u52bf\u8d85TFS\u52a3\u52bf\u53ef\u8d85\u6559\u5e08\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11TFS\u52a3\u52bf\uff0c\u53caAW\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u5728SFS\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684QA\u3001NER\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u5e08\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients.

Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \\textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u66dd\u5149\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u66dd\u5149\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u66dd\u5149\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u542b\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66dd\u5149\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u66dd\u5149\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528ManySStuBs4J\u57fa\u51c6\u548cData Portraits\u5bf9Stack - V2\u8bed\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6309\u66dd\u5149\u5206\u5c42\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u793a\u4f8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u65e0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6709\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u66f4\u591a\u91cd\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u6700\u5927\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u6307\u6807\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u4ec5\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66dd\u5149\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLLM\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs.

Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance.

However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes.

Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines.

Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347ICL\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u6709\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347ICL\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3aICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u591a\u5c42transformer\u6a21\u62dfEM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "transformer\u80fd\u4ece\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ICL\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5c11\u6837\u672cICL\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u5bf9transformer\u7684ICL\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems.

This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).\n  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.\n  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria.

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives.

Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment.

However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u963b\u788dRL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709KV\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSparse - RL\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u5e8f\u5217KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7528\u4e8eRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Sparse - RL\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "Sparse - RL\u76f8\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6eda\u52a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Sparse - RL\u80fd\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6eda\u52a8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5nEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "nEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u4e14\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u7ed9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7c7bNMD\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u627e\u51fa\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3anEMG\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation.

They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.\n  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that \"everything is text\".

Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations.

Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens.

However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.\n  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios.

Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL).

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems.

Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%.

By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier.

To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments.

Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6LADFA\u5206\u6790\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u3001RAG\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u7ecf\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7528LLMs\u5206\u6790\u4f46\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u4e0eRAG\u53ca\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\u7684LADFA\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u884c\u4e1a\u5341\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LADFA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u5916\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08GR - PCA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GR - PCA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u4f7f\u8f7d\u8377\u504f\u5411\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cGR - PCA\u80fd\u5c06\u65b9\u5dee\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9884\u671f\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u80fd\u91cf\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5916\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "GR - PCA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations.

But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric.

It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings.

We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\u03ba$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\u03ba$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\u03c3$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy\n  $\u03c3\\ge \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\ln M}}$ $\\quad\\text{or}\\quad$ $\u03ba\\ge\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}\\!\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\u03c0\\ln M}}\\right)$,\n  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \\to \\infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors.

However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue.

However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure.

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent.

The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions.

The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction.

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts.

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes.

The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMetaDG\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMetaDG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5143\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MetaDG\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaDG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these \"what-if\" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%.

Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin.

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u951a\u5b9a\u8de8\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u6587\u6863\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u8986\u76d6\u6b21\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6846\u67b6\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data.

We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u8d39\u66fc - \u5361\u8328\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u79bb\u6563\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563 Feynman - Kac \u6821\u6b63\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u987a\u5e8f\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08SMC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5e03\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4e58\u79ef\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u4ece\u8fb9\u9645\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f0a\u8f9b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCS - GBA\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6709\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6295\u6bd2\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7834\u574f\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee55%\u6295\u6bd2\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0CS - GBA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSODACER\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CBFs\u548cSophia\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728HPV\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSODACER\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u6162\u901f\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u96c6\u6210CBFs\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408Sophia\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728HPV\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cSODACER\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u504f\u5dee - \u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "SODACER - Sophia\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6709\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5).

Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51faGradESTC\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51cf\u5c11\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u538b\u7f29\u5355\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGradESTC\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5c06\u5168\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cGradESTC\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1139.79%\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u7684FedAvg\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "GradESTC\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u68af\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We concluded health-data classification and grading rules in accordance with GB/T 39725-2020. Combining few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules, the backend-agnostic extraction pipeline achieves strong category compliance and reliable sensitivity across diverse LLMs. On the MedDialog-CN benchmark, models yields robust entity counts, high schema compliance, and accurate sensitivity grading, while the strongest model attains micro-F1=0.900 for maximum-level prediction. The category landscape stratified by sensitivity shows that Level 2-3 items dominate, enabling re-identification when combined; Level 4-5 items are less frequent but carry outsize harm.

We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models.

By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD).

However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work.

However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faProcess - Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG - CBM)\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) \u5ffd\u7565\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u8fc7\u7a0b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPG - CBM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u6709\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u9075\u5faa\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u4e0a\u751f\u7269\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0cPG - CBM\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "PG - CBM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u865a\u5047\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8fc8\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage.

Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments.

Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in COAML. We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure.

Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Na\u00efve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Na\u00efve RAG.

In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with \"should not.\" We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios.

We introduce STEM (Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules), a static, token-indexed approach that replaces the FFN up-projection with a layer-local embedding lookup while keeping the gate and down-projection dense. This removes runtime routing, enables CPU offload with asynchronous prefetch, and decouples capacity from both per-token FLOPs and cross-device communication. Empirically, STEM trains stably despite extreme sparsity. It improves downstream performance over dense baselines while reducing per-token FLOPs and parameter accesses (eliminating roughly one-third of FFN parameters). STEM learns embedding spaces with large angular spread which enhances its knowledge storage capacity. More interestingly, this enhanced knowledge capacity comes with better interpretability. The token-indexed nature of STEM embeddings allows simple ways to perform knowledge editing and knowledge injection in an interpretable manner without any intervention in the input text or additional computation. In addition, STEM strengthens long-context performance: as sequence length grows, more distinct parameters are activated, yielding practical test-time capacity scaling. Across 350M and 1B model scales, STEM delivers up to ~3--4% accuracy improvements overall, with notable gains on knowledge and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, GSM8K, MMLU).

Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u6570\u636e\u6279\u6b21\u5e73\u5747\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5373\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d7\u7f51\u7edc\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5bf9\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u5148\u524d\u6570\u636e\u6279\u6b21\u5e73\u5747\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9 Gemma 2B \u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5728\u6bcf\u5206\u7247\u970d\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u7684 0.5% \u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u9999\u519c\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u7684 1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5373\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u3002"}}

However, writing research introductions is more challenging. It requires rigorous logic, coherent structure, and abstract summarization. Existing workflows often suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence. To address these limitations, we propose eliminating external agentic workflows. Instead, we directly parameterize their logical structure into the LLM. This allows the generation of a complete introduction in a single inference. To this end, we introduce the Stage Token for Introduction Generation (STIG). STIG converts the multiple stages of the original workflow into explicit stage signals. These signals guide the model to follow different logical roles and functions during generation. Through instruction tuning, the model learns the mapping between stage tokens and text functions. It also learns the logical order and transition patterns between stages, encoding this knowledge into the model parameters. Experimental results show that STIG can generate multi-stage text in a single inference. It does not require explicit workflow calls. STIG outperforms traditional agentic workflows and other baselines on metrics of semantic similarity and sentence-level structural rationality.

Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available.

The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy.

Current research primarily focuses on binary \"detection\" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from \"detection\" to \"diagnosis\". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models.

Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation.

While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving \"template-only\" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%.

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86TuneCLIP\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u4ec5\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTuneCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6062\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "TuneCLIP\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "TuneCLIP\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence.

Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCLiMB\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728RR Lyrae\u6052\u661f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u5df2\u77e5\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u5168\u5c40\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fc7\u5f3a\u6216\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u65b0\u5947\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CLiMB\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u533a\u951a\u5b9a\u5df2\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RR Lyrae\u6052\u661f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cCLiMB\u8c03\u6574\u5170\u5fb7\u6307\u6570\u8fbe0.829\uff0c\u79cd\u5b50\u8986\u76d6\u738790%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "CLiMB\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9047\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u5bf9\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u8fc7\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u826f\u6027\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u6076\u610f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u826f\u6027\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lycos2017\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684AUROC\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347.000065\u548c.060883\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6OpenAUC\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347.170883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones.

We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks.

In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u5b50\u5c42\u6c89\u79ef\uff08ALD\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406LLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316ALD\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406LLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0eALD\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7528\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u9014\u5f84\u53ca\u975e\u81ea\u9650\u6210\u5206\u7684ALD\u5de5\u5177\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eALD\u81ea\u9650\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u9971\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u4ee3\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u81ea\u8eab\u5148\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316ALD\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u53d7\u5148\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions.

This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what \"understanding\" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will \"derive fundamental physics\" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important.

However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question.

Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making.

If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training.

However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMedVL - SAM2\u7edf\u4e003D\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e3D\u5b9a\u4f4d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MedVL - SAM2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eSAM2\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u518d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3001VQA\u548c\u591a\u79cd3D\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u97603D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u76843D\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e3D\u5b9a\u4f4d"}}

This paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning framework for per-device CFO calibration, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight receiver adaptation. A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions.

However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u7528\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578bLAP\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u897f\u65b9\u827a\u672f\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u5143\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7f8e\u5b66\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u4ee3\u8868\u8c01\u7684\u5ba1\u7f8e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9LAP\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLAION - Aesthetics\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u827a\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9LAP\u521b\u5efa\u76f8\u5173\u516c\u5171\u6750\u6599\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "LAP\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65f6\u5bf9\u63d0\u53ca\u5973\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u7537\u6027\u548cLGBTQ + \u4eba\u7fa4\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u5229\uff1b\u5bf9\u897f\u65b9\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u5199\u5b9e\u98ce\u666f\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u8096\u50cf\u753b\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1LAP\u53cd\u6620\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u5ef6\u7eed\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0cAI\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u591a\u5143\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \\footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMoST\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MAMoE\u67b6\u6784\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAMoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u8def\u7531\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMoST\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "MoST\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u97f3 - \u6587\u672c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.\n  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy.

We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation.

Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture.

Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding.

In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT).

We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\\partial \u03b8] \\in \u03a9(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states.

This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench.

The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics.

Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods.

In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence.

On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce \"No Evidence, No Score\", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFITO\u8303\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u957f\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSIN-Data\u548cSIN-Bench\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u63a5\u5730\u6027\u662f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u957f\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4ec5\u5339\u914d\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFITO\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSIN-Data\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548cSIN-Bench\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u65e0\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u5206\u201d\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGemini - 3 - pro\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cGPT - 5\u5728SIN - QA\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6574\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u957f\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a5\u5730\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u652f\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

These measures are intended to have the property of 0 expectation under a null distribution and maximum value 1 under maximal similarity to aid in interpretation. Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions.

We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster.

However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices.

Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \\emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance.

This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS.

While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5207\u9664II - III\u671fNSCLC\u603b\u751f\u5b58\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08NSCLC\uff09\u751f\u5b58\u9700\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u3001\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0cWSI\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408C\u6307\u6570\u8fbe73.30\u3002\u4fe1\u606f\u5c11\u7684CT\u6a21\u6001\u4f1a\u88ab\u81ea\u52a8\u964d\u6743\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8NSCLC\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model.

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMolmo2\uff0c\u6709\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e13\u6709\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c67\u4e2a\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2\u4e2a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u6253\u5305\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u6811\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u8d85\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Molmo2\u662f\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLIBERTy\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5e72\u9884\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u660e\u786e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684LIBERTy\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "LIBERTy\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u4fe1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6025\u9700\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.
