This work introduces a hybrid thermoplasmonic and thermoelectric energy harvester that combines multiband plasmonic absorption with machine-learning-guided optimization to improve on-body energy conversion. A broadband metasurface made of cross-bowtie nanoantennas is designed to absorb infrared radiation across the 2 to 12 micron range, capturing human body emission, ambient infrared radiation, and near-infrared sunlight. Electromagnetic simulations show strong field enhancement in nanoscale antenna gaps, producing localized thermoplasmonic heating directly above flexible Bi2Te3 thermoelectric junctions. Coupled optical, thermal, and electrical modeling indicates that this localized heating increases the effective temperature difference from the typical 3 to 4 degrees C of standard wearable thermoelectric generators to approximately 13 degrees C. This results in a power density of about 0.15 mW per cm^2 under indoor-relevant infrared flux, representing a four- to six-fold improvement over existing flexible devices. A machine-learning surrogate model trained on multiphysics data predicts temperature rise and electrical output with high accuracy (R2 greater than 0.92) and identifies optimal device geometries through Pareto-front analysis. The proposed hybrid thermoplasmonic, thermoelectric, and machine-learning framework provides a scalable route toward more efficient, compact, and flexible energy harvesters for autonomous and long-term wearable physiological monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u70ed\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u548c\u70ed\u7535\u80fd\u6536\u96c6\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5438\u6536\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u65e0\u7535\u6c60\u7535\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u76ae\u80a4\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u70ed\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u53d7\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5dee\u5c0f\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u70ed\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u548c\u70ed\u7535\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u5438\u6536\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bbd\u5e26\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u5438\u6536\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u7535\u78c1\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5149\u70ed\u7535\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5c40\u90e8\u52a0\u70ed\u4f7f\u6709\u6548\u6e29\u5dee\u4ece3 - 4\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u7ea613\u6444\u6c0f\u5ea6\uff0c\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fbe0.15 mW/cm\u00b2\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u9ad84 - 6\u500d\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, we observe that current state-of-the-art energy-based methods suffer from an asynchronous phenomenon, where the optimization of the physical loss is constrained by the flow matching inference process. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Dflow-SUR, a differentiation strategy that separates the optimization of the physical loss from the flow matching inference.\n  Compared to the most advanced energy-based baseline, Dflow-SUR achieves a reduction in physical loss by four orders of magnitude, while also cutting wall-clock time by 74% on the airfoil case. Additionally, it increases the mean lift-to-drag ratio by 11.8% over traditional Latin-hypercube sampling in wing design. Beyond improvements in accuracy and efficiency, Dflow-SUR offers three additional practical advantages: (i) enhanced control over guidance, (ii) lower surrogate uncertainty, and (iii) greater robustness to hyper-parameter tuning.\n  Together, these results demonstrate that Dflow-SUR is a highly promising framework, providing both scalability and high fidelity for generative aerodynamic design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDflow - SUR\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7ffc\u578b\u548c\u673a\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u662f\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u53d7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Dflow - SUR\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u8fdb\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u7ffc\u578b\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1174%\uff1b\u673a\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5347\u963b\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad811.8%\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u989d\u5916\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Dflow - SUR\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This study presents an improved protocol combining experimental testing and computational modelling to determine the mechanical properties of the brain-skull interface under shear loading. Brain tissue and brain-skull complex samples were extracted from sheep cadaver heads and subjected to shear loading. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to obtain accurate 3D geometries of the samples, which were then used to create computational grids (meshes) for simulation of the experiments using finite element (FE) models to determine subject-specific properties of the brain tissue and brain-skull interface. A second-order Ogden hyperelastic model was used for the brain tissue, and a cohesive layer was employed to model the brain-skull interface. Our results indicate that a cohesive layer captures the force-displacement and damage initiation of the brain-skull interface. The calibrated cohesive properties showed consistent patterns across samples, with maximum normal tractions ranging from 2.8-3.4 kPa and maximum tangential tractions from 1.8-2.1 kPa.

Companion to Agentic Capital. Submitted to establish priority", "summary": "This paper develops the Theory of Strategic Evolution, a general model for systems in which the population of players, strategies, and institutional rules evolve together. The theory extends replicator dynamics to settings with endogenous players, multi level selection, innovation, constitutional change, and meta governance. The central mathematical object is a Poiesis stack: a hierarchy of strategic layers linked by cross level gain matrices. Under small gain conditions, the system admits a global Lyapunov function and satisfies selection, tracking, and stochastic stability results at every finite depth.

With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.\n  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling.

Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call.

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics.

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9762\u5411\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08DOD\uff09\u548c\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08OOD\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6838CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0cDOD\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6838CPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4DOD\u548cOOD\u5728\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4A*\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u3001\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\u3001\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bOOD\u548c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bDOD\u56db\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548cCPU\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dDOD\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1bOOD\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u7f13\u5b58\u672a\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u4e0a\u5076\u6709\u5c0f\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u5728A*\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0cDOD\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\u4f53\u73b0\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u590d\u6742\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis.

Across models, countries, and retrieval settings, the LLMs produce coherent and country-specific stress narratives, yielding stable tail-risk amplification with limited sensitivity to retrieval choices. Comprehensive plausibility checks, scenario diagnostics, and ANOVA-based variance decomposition show that risk variation is driven primarily by portfolio composition and prompt design rather than by the retrieval mechanism.

Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping.

To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences.

In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems.

This paper presents a critical evaluation of this claim, suggesting that Bitcoin faces significant structural barriers to qualifying as money. It synthesizes critiques from two distinct schools of economic thought - Post-Keynesianism and the Austrian School - and validates their conclusions with rigorous technical analysis. From a Post-Keynesian perspective, it is argued that Bitcoin does not function as money because it is not a debt-based IOU and fails to exhibit the essential properties required for a stable monetary asset (Vianna, 2021). Concurrently, from an Austrian viewpoint, it is shown to be inconsistent with a strict interpretation of Mises's Regression Theorem, as it lacks prior non-monetary value and has not achieved the status of the most saleable commodity (Peniaz and Kavaliou, 2024). These theoretical arguments are then supported by an empirical analysis of Bitcoin's extreme volatility, hard-coded scalability limits, fragile market structure, and insecure long-term economic design.

Specifically, we developed a hybrid framework combining a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with the Merton-L\u00e9vy jump-diffusion model. To optimise this framework, we employed the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for the LSTM hyperparameter tuning, and we explored three calibration methods for the Merton-Levy model parameters: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), and the PyTorch-based TorchSDE library. To evaluate the predictive performance of our hybrid model, we compared it against several benchmark models, including a standard LSTM and an LSTM combined with the Fractional Heston model.

We consider mechanisms for privacy-aware users whose utility depends not only on the outcome of the mechanism but also negatively on the exposure of their economic preferences. Specifically, we study two auction-theoretic settings with privacy-aware users. First, we analyze an order flow auction, where a user auctions off to specialized agents, called searchers, the right to execute her transaction while maintaining a degree of privacy. We examine how the degree of privacy affects the revenue of the auction and, broadly, the net utility of the privacy-aware user. In this new setting, we describe the optimal auction, which is a sealed-bid auction. Subsequently, we analyze a variant of a Dutch auction in which the user gradually decreases the price and the degree of privacy until the transaction is sold. We compare the revenue of this auction to that of the optimal one as a function of the number of communication rounds. Then, we introduce a two-sided market - a privacy marketplace - with multiple users selling their transactions under their privacy preferences to multiple searchers. We propose a posted-price mechanism for the two-sided market that guarantees constant approximation of the optimal social welfare while maintaining incentive compatibility (from both sides of the market) and budget balance.

We address the problem of quantifying how far a dataset deviates from such trends. To this end, we introduce Aggregate Order Dependencies (AODs), an aggregation-centric extension of the previously studied order dependencies. An AOD specifies that the aggregated value of a target attribute (e.g., mean salary) should monotonically increase or decrease with the grouping attribute (e.g., education level).\n  We formulate the AOD repair problem as finding the smallest set of tuples to delete from a table so that the given AOD is satisfied. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem and propose a general algorithmic template for solving it. We instantiate the template for common aggregation functions, introduce optimization techniques that substantially improve the runtime of the template instances, and develop efficient heuristic alternatives. Our experimental study, carried out on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrates the practical efficiency of the algorithms and provides insight into the performance of the heuristics.

This innovative system is established based on the Global Data Plane in the area of edge computing. Our comprehensive design and implementation of CFS successfully fulfill the objective of providing a multi-credential Common Access API. The architecture of CFS is methodically segmented into three integral components: Firstly, the DataCapsule server, tasked with the storage, dissemination, and replication of DataCapsules on the edge. Secondly, the middleware, a crucial element running in a Trusted Execution Environment responsible for the enforcement and management of write permissions and requests. Finally, the client component, which manifests as a POSIX-compliant filesystem, is adaptable and operational across many architectures. Experimental evaluations of CFS reveal that, while its read and write performances are comparatively modest, it upholds a high degree of functional correctness.

While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u4eceAI\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u8f6c\u5411\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ba1\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6808\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u672a\u8fbe\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14AI\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u63a8\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671b\u6fc0\u53d1\u8ba8\u8bba\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002"}}

Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics.

In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change.

Our approach constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior, using a warm-start strategy to initialize the particles. To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure.

Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSoftly Symbolified Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks (S2KAN)\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u539f\u8bed\u878d\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u81ea\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Kolmogorov - Arnold Networks (KANs) \u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b26\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e94\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faS2KAN\uff0c\u5c06\u7b26\u53f7\u539f\u8bed\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u9879\u5b57\u5178\u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95e8\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u538b\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u81ea\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "S2KAN \u80fd\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u9879\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using a verified Transaction Cost Index (TCI) derived from Blockchain.com on-chain data and Hansen's (2000) threshold regression, we identify a definitive structural break at the 90th percentile of friction (TCI ~ 1.63). The analysis reveals a bifurcation in network utility: while the network exhibits robust velocity growth of +15.44% during normal regimes, this collapses to +6.06% during shock regimes, yielding a statistically significant Net Utility Contraction of -9.39% (p = 0.012). Crucially, Instrumental Variable (IV) tests utilizing Hashrate Variation as a supply-side instrument fail to detect a significant relationship in a linear specification (p=0.196), confirming that the velocity constraint is strictly a regime-switching phenomenon rather than a continuous linear function.

While traditional models of spectrum auctions often rely on strong equilibrium assumptions, we take a more parsimonious approach by modeling bidders as myopic and straightforward: in each round, firms simply demand the bundle that maximizes their utility given current prices. Despite its simplicity, this model proves effective in predicting the outcomes of Canada's 2023 auction of 3800 MHz spectrum licenses. Using detailed round-by-round bidding data, we estimate bidders' valuations through a linear programming framework and validate that our model reproduces key features of the observed allocation and price evolution. We then use these estimated valuations to simulate a counterfactual auction under an alternative mechanism that incentivizes deployment in rural and remote regions, aligning with one of the key objectives set out in the Canadian Telecommunications Act. The results show that the proposed mechanism substantially improves population coverage in underserved areas. These findings demonstrate that a behavioral model with minimal assumptions is sufficient to generate reliable counterfactual predictions, making it a practical tool for policymakers to evaluate how alternative auction designs may influence future outcomes.

To better understand an observed disparity, we need explanations that can pinpoint the data regions where the disparity is most pronounced, along with its causes, i.e., factors that alleviate or exacerbate the disparity. This task is complex and tedious, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets, demanding an automatic system for discovering explanations (data regions and causes) of an observed disparity. It is critical that explanations for disparities are not only interpretable but also actionable-enabling users to make informed, data-driven decisions. This requires explanations to go beyond surface-level correlations and instead capture causal relationships. We introduce ExDis, a framework for discovering causal Explanations for Disparities between two groups of interest.

While prior work has focused primarily on kernel-level performance or single-GPU microbenchmarks, the complex interaction between communication, computation, memory behavior, and power management in multi-GPU LLM training remains poorly characterized. In this work, we introduce Chopper, a profiling and analysis framework that collects, aligns, and visualizes GPU kernel traces and hardware performance counters across multiple granularities (i.e., from individual kernels to operations, layers, phases, iterations, and GPUs). Using Chopper, we perform a comprehensive end-to-end characterization of Llama 3 8B training under fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) on an eight-GPU AMD InstinctTM MI300X node. Our analysis reveals several previously underexplored bottlenecks and behaviors, such as memory determinism enabling higher, more stable GPU and memory frequencies. We identify several sources of inefficiencies, with frequency overhead (DVFS effects) being the single largest contributor to the gap between theoretical and observed performance, exceeding the impact of MFMA utilization loss, communication/computation overlap, and kernel launch overheads.

Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning.

Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice.

The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations. We assess eleven architectures spanning neural operator methods (e.g., Fourier Neural Operator), geometric deep learning (PointNet, RegDGCNN, PointMAE, PointTransformer), transformer-based neural solvers (Transolver, Transolver++, AB-UPT), and implicit field networks (TripNet). Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty. To accelerate progress in data-driven engineering, we open-source the benchmark framework, including training pipelines, uncertainty estimation routines based on bootstrap resampling, and pretrained model weights, establishing the first reproducible foundation for large-scale learning from high-fidelity CFD simulations, available at https://github.com/Mohamedelrefaie/CarBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u6c7d\u8f66\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6CarBench\uff0c\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u63a8\u52a8\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf911\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fCFD\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We develop a generative modeling framework for worst-case generation for a pre-specified risk, based on min-max optimization over continuous probability distributions, namely the Wasserstein space. Unlike traditional discrete distributionally robust optimization approaches, which often suffer from scalability issues, limited generalization, and costly worst-case inference, our framework exploits the Brenier theorem to characterize the least favorable (worst-case) distribution as the pushforward of a transport map from a continuous reference measure, enabling a continuous and expressive notion of risk-induced generation beyond classical discrete DRO formulations. Based on the min-max formulation, we propose a Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)-type scheme that updates the decision model and the transport map in a single loop, establishing global convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions and possibly without convexity-concavity. We also propose to parameterize the transport map using a neural network that can be trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations by matching the transported training samples, thereby achieving a simulation-free approach. The efficiency of the proposed method as a risk-induced worst-case generator is validated by numerical experiments on synthetic and image data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528GDA\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6700\u5c0f - \u6700\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Brenier\u5b9a\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGDA\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002"}}

Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \\textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \\textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \\textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \\num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook.

Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models.

This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

The paper documents several findings. First, ARDL analysis shows that 1 TL increase in CDS shrinks BIST-100 index by 22.5 TL in short-run and 85.5 TL in long-run. Second, 1000 TL increase in BIST index price causes 25 TL and 44 TL reducation in Turkey's CDS prices in short- and long-run respectively. Third, a percentage increase in interest rate shrinks BIST index by 359 TL and a percentage increase in inflation rate scales CDS prices up to 13.34 TL both in long-run. In case of short-run, these impacts are limited with 231 TL and 5.73 TL respectively. Fourth, a kurush increase in TL/USD exchange rate leads 24.5 TL (short-run) and 78 TL (long-run) reductions in BIST, while it augments CDS prices by 2.5 TL (short-run) and 3 TL (long-run) respectively.

Specifically, we analyze two stochastic models of regularized learning in continuous games -- one in continuous and one in discrete time with the aim of characterizing the long-run behavior of the induced sequence of play. In stark contrast to deterministic, full-information models of learning (or models with a vanishing learning rate), we show that the resulting dynamics do not converge in general. In lieu of this, we ask instead which actions are played more often in the long run, and by how much. We show that, in strongly monotone games, the dynamics of regularized learning may wander away from equilibrium infinitely often, but they always return to its vicinity in finite time (which we estimate), and their long-run distribution is sharply concentrated around a neighborhood thereof. We quantify the degree of this concentration, and we show that these favorable properties may all break down if the underlying game is not strongly monotone -- underscoring in this way the limits of regularized learning in the presence of persistent randomness and uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u6709\u5229\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u975e\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u65e0\u9650\u6b21\u504f\u79bb\u5747\u8861\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd4\u56de\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u975e\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u3002"}}

Corporations and legal teams must organize, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large image collections under strict time pressures, making manual review impractical and costly. These demands have intensified interest in automated methods that can efficiently organize and describe large-scale image datasets. This paper presents a systematic investigation of automated cluster description generation through the integration of image clustering, image captioning, and large language models (LLMs). We apply K-means clustering to group images into 20 visually coherent clusters and generate base captions using the Azure AI Vision API. We then evaluate three critical dimensions of the cluster description process: (1) image sampling strategies, comparing random, centroid-based, stratified, hybrid, and density-based sampling against using all cluster images; (2) prompting techniques, contrasting standard prompting with chain-of-thought prompting; and (3) description generation methods, comparing LLM-based generation with traditional TF-IDF and template-based approaches. We assess description quality using semantic similarity and coverage metrics. Results show that strategic sampling with 20 images per cluster performs comparably to exhaustive inclusion while significantly reducing computational cost, with only stratified sampling showing modest degradation. LLM-based methods consistently outperform TF-IDF baselines, and standard prompts outperform chain-of-thought prompts for this task.

We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u589e\u5f3a\u60a3\u8005-\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5339\u914d\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u534f\u8c03\u5458\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u60a3\u8005\u7b5b\u9009\u662f\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u8d44\u683c\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u9879\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u60a3\u8005\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u534f\u8c03\u5458\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u8003\u8651\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u96c6\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1AI\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a review of existing gray literature, examining fairness requirements in AI context, with a focus on how they are defined across various application domains, managed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and the causes, as well as the corresponding consequences of their violation by AI models. Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions. These findings emphasize the need for consistent frameworks and practices to integrate fairness into AI software, paying as much attention to fairness as to effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u7070\u8272\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001SDLC\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u8fdd\u89c4\u539f\u56e0\u4e0e\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u878d\u5165AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7070\u8272\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u987e\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u6837\uff0cSDLC\u4e2d\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e38\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u540e\u679c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u878d\u5165AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed9\u4e88\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u540c\u7b49\u5173\u6ce8\u3002"}}

On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity.

When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding.

As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety.

Starting with the former, we introduce the notion of a robust equilibrium as those equilibria that remain invariant to small -- but otherwise arbitrary -- perturbations to the game's payoff structure, and we provide a crisp geometric characterization thereof. Subsequently, we turn to the question of dynamic robustness, and we examine which equilibria may arise as stable limit points of the dynamics of \"follow the regularized leader\" (FTRL) in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. Despite their very distinct origins, we establish a structural correspondence between these two notions of robustness: strategic robustness implies dynamic robustness, and, conversely, the requirement of strategic robustness cannot be relaxed if dynamic robustness is to be maintained. Finally, we examine the rate of convergence to robust equilibria as a function of the underlying regularizer, and we show that entropically regularized learning converges at a geometric rate in games with affinely constrained action spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5728\u6218\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8fde\u7eed\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5728\u6218\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u5747\u8861\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u518d\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4eff\u5c04\u7ea6\u675f\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u53d7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Motivated by this architectural trend, the emulation of high-precision matrix multiplication using low-precision hardware has attracted significant interest in the high-performance computing community. Ozaki, Uchino, and Imamura introduced the Ozaki-II scheme as a general framework for emulating matrix multiplication. Building on this framework, Uchino, Ozaki, and Imamura developed high-performance and power-efficient techniques for emulating single- and double-precision real matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines. Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed. Conversely, with only a modest increase in computation time, they can also deliver higher accuracy than the standard routines.

This paper presents an empirical study investigating the role of randomness in LLM-based classification for attorney-client privileged document detection, focusing on four key dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying legally privileged documents, (2) the influence of randomness control parameters on classification outputs, (3) their impact on overall classification performance, and (4) a methodology for leveraging randomness to enhance accuracy. Experimental results showed that LLMs can identify privileged documents effectively, randomness control parameters have minimal impact on classification performance, and importantly, our developed methodology for leveraging randomness can have a significant impact on improving accuracy. Notably, this methodology that leverages randomness could also enhance a corporation's confidence in an LLM's output when incorporated into its sanctions-compliance processes.

Argumentation can be a pivotal device for diverse stakeholders in OSS usability discussions to express opinions and persuade others. However, the characteristics of argument discourse in those discussions remain unknown, resulting in difficulties in providing effective support for discussion participants. We address this through a comprehensive analysis of argument discourse and quality in five OSS projects. Our results indicated that usability discussions are predominantly argument-driven, although their qualities vary. Issue comments exhibit lower-quality arguments than the issue posts, suggesting a shortage of collective intelligence about usability in OSS communities. Moreover, argument discourse and quality have various impacts on the subsequent behavior of participants. Overall, this research offers insights to help OSS stakeholders build more effective arguments and eventually improve OSS usability.

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $\u03c4$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%.

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration.

The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u56fd\u5185\u822a\u73ed\u673a\u7968\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7528PDS - LASSO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f4e\u4ef7\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u610f\u5916\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u521b\u65b0\u5ba2\u8231\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u98de\u673a\u5ba2\u8231\u5ea7\u4f4d\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u56fd\u5185\u822a\u73ed\u673a\u7968\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u767b\u673a\u724c\u5fae\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u9762\u8c08\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528Post - Double - Selection LASSO (PDS - LASSO)\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u65b0\u5ba2\u8231\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u65e0\u9009\u5ea7\u8d39\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u4ef7\u7968\u4e58\u5ba2\u56e0\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u8d2d\u7968\u5e38\u88ab\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e2d\u95f4\u5ea7\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u98de\u673a\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u9879\u4e3b\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u6536\u5165\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u903b\u8f91\u3002"}}

A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684GNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6gHAWK\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728OGB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012GNN\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Bloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97TransE\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u5168\u5c40\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728OGB\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cgHAWK\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f4d\u5c45OGB\u6392\u884c\u699c\u699c\u9996\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0cgHAWK\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches.

However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies. Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210Go\u5305\u65f6\u7684\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e94\u4e2aQwen\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5728\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u30018\u4f4d\u548c4\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c4\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5305\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5b58\u5728\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u5305\u591a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u57fa\u4e8eURL\u7684Go\u6a21\u5757\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u90e8\u7f72\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4bGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5e38\u4e0d\u8db3\u51fa\u73b0\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578bGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5404\u5c42\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea68.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAPE\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages.

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings.

This problem arises because users typically interact with only a small subset of available items, leading existing models to arbitrarily treat unobserved items as negative samples. To this end, we propose VI-MMRec, a model-agnostic and training cost-free framework that enriches sparse user-item interactions via similarity-aware virtual user-item interactions. These virtual interactions are constructed based on modality-specific feature similarities of user-interacted items. Specifically, VI-MMRec introduces two different strategies: (1) Overlay, which independently aggregates modality-specific similarities to preserve modality-specific user preferences, and (2) Synergistic, which holistically fuses cross-modal similarities to capture complementary user preferences. To ensure high-quality augmentation, we design a statistically informed weight allocation mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to virtual user-item interactions based on dataset-specific modality relevance.

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u6216\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u7528\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u513f\u7ae5\u4e0e\u6210\u4eba\u5229\u7528\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u82e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u51c6\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201c\u8d4b\u80fd\u201d\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u8981\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u513f\u7ae5\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u70b9\u3002"}}

Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration. The library's implicit use of unlimited shots yielded dense probability distributions, whereas the v2 default of 10 000 shots captured only 23% of the state space. Increasing shots to 250 000 restored library-level accuracy.

HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions.

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data.

However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead.

The proportional hazards mixture cure model is especially advantageous when the presence of a cured fraction can be reasonably assumed, providing a more accurate representation of long-term survival dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for the semiparametric mixture cure model, which accommodates both the inclusion and exclusion of a frailty component, allowing for greater flexibility in capturing unobserved heterogeneity among patients. Samples from the posterior distribution are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, leveraging a hierarchical structure inspired by Bayesian Lasso. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted across diverse scenarios to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed models.

Our simulation results indicate that spatial shifting can substantially lower carbon, water, and land use footprints, with observed reductions ranging from 20% to 85%, depending on the scenario and optimization criteria. Temporal shifting also decreases the footprint, though to a lesser extent.

However, most existing LAD approaches assume centralized training, which is often impractical due to privacy constraints and the decentralized nature of system logs. While federated learning (FL) offers a promising alternative, there is a lack of dedicated testbeds tailored to the needs of LAD in federated settings. To address this, we present FedLAD, a unified platform for training and evaluating LAD models under FL constraints. FedLAD supports plug-and-play integration of diverse LAD models, benchmark datasets, and aggregation strategies, while offering runtime support for validation logging (self-monitoring), parameter tuning (self-configuration), and adaptive strategy control (self-adaptation). By enabling reproducible and scalable experimentation, FedLAD bridges the gap between FL frameworks and LAD requirements, providing a solid foundation for future research.

However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\\% improvement in recall and 7.63\\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction.

While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \\textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \\textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \\textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \\textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \\textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \\textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6838\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236LUNA\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6838\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236LUNA\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728LRA\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u6548Transformer\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u540e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "LUNA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA^2GFM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations for node and graph classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSA^2GFM\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u591f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u6811\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u793e\u533a\u5185\u548c\u793e\u533a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "SA^2GFM\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6297\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e9\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "SA^2GFM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%.

This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals.

TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B.

However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Simulations under a stratified two-stage cluster design provide finite sample performance and demonstrate the statistical error price of ignoring the survey design.

Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in T\u00fcrkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test).

It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation.

Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model.

Also available on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17533851", "summary": "Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset.

Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches.

The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNN\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f46\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u96be\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0XAI\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGNN\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u96be\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u56fe\u57fa\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578bXAI\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684GNN\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6355\u6349\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Given binary treatments, the experimenter's goal is to choose the treatment with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment, in order to maximize welfare. We consider adaptive experiments that consist of two phases, the treatment allocation phase and the treatment choice phase. The experiment starts with the treatment allocation phase, where the experimenter allocates treatments to experimental subjects to gather observations. During this phase, the experimenter can adaptively update the allocation probabilities using the observations obtained in the experiment. After the allocation phase, the experimenter proceeds to the treatment choice phase, where one of the treatments is selected as the best. For this adaptive experimental procedure, we propose an adaptive experiment that splits the treatment allocation phase into two stages, where we first estimate the standard deviations and then allocate each treatment proportionally to its standard deviation. We show that this experiment, often referred to as Neyman allocation, is minimax and Bayes optimal in the sense that its regret upper bounds exactly match the lower bounds that we derive. To show this optimality, we derive minimax and Bayes lower bounds for the regret using change-of-measure arguments.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline.

Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation.

However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes.

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged.

We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes.

Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165\u68f1\u67f1\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578bPRISM - WM\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6eda\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u524d\u77bb\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u590d\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PRISM - WM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u8fc7\u6e21\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u4fdd\u4e13\u5bb6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "PRISM - WM\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6eda\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM - WM\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures.

To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u4e92\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u591a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed5\u5f00\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u5728\u684c\u9762\u5faa\u73af\u6c34\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u76f8\u8fde\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u963b\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u963b\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u65e0\u53cd\u9988\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\uff1b\u65e0\u6d41\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u963b\u529b\u65f6\u96be\u83b7\u826f\u7b56\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u963b\u529b\u4ecd\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u8f83\u7f13\u6162\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6280\u80fd\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u6267\u884c\u591a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their susceptibility to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), where adversaries aim to infer whether a particular code sample was used during training, poses serious privacy concerns. While MIA has been widely investigated in NLP and vision domains, its effects on security-critical code analysis tasks remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of MIA on VP models, evaluating the attack success across various architectures (LSTM, BiGRU, and CodeBERT) and feature combinations, including embeddings, logits, loss, and confidence. Our threat model aligns with black-box and gray-box settings where prediction outputs are observable, allowing adversaries to infer membership by analyzing output discrepancies between training and non-training samples. The empirical findings reveal that logits and loss are the most informative and vulnerable outputs for membership leakage. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Noise-based Membership Inference Defense (NMID), which is a lightweight defense module that applies output masking and Gaussian noise injection to disrupt adversarial inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NMID significantly reduces MIA effectiveness, lowering the attack AUC from nearly 1.0 to below 0.65, while preserving the predictive utility of VP models.

Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4eceCPGs\u5230DTG\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efaAIR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5e93\u7ea7\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eceCPGs\u5230DTG\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAIR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548cDTG\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u903b\u8f91\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u9677\u9631\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSWE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728SWE - Verified\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u8fbe87.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u4ee3\u7801\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.\n  In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.\n  We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests.

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5CITL\uff0c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SOH\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7eed\u822a\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6dfb\u52a0\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b49\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8282\u70b9\u53c2\u6570\u8de8\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7535\u6c60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCITL\u5728SOH\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6bd4SS - TCA\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u4f1883.73%\u300161.15%\u7b49\uff08\u4ee5\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u4e8eCITL\u7684SOH\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7f51\u7edc\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002"}}

In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or \"topics\". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\\mathbf{X}^\\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity.

Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead.

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data.\n  In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation.

While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning.

Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow.

Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning.

Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance.

Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce \"thin descriptions\", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing \"thick descriptions\".

Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.\n  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the \"path of least resistance\" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.\n  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its \"main\" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u8eab\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3GPT - 5 - Thinking\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u8fd8\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u81ea\u8eab\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u89c2\u70b9\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u5956\u52b1\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u7b54\u6848\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8bda\u5b9e\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3GPT - 5 - Thinking\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u7b54\u6848\u8bf4\u8c0e\u6216\u9690\u7792\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u80fd\u8bda\u5b9e\u5730\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\uff0c\u4e14\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u5ea6\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u201c\u5fcf\u6094\u201d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5982\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5411\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager. In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings. Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results. This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments.

Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \\emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an \"action chunk\") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \\textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}.

By integrating audio clips with spatially aligned 3D scenes, our datasets enable research on how audio signals interact with spatial context. To associate audio events with corresponding spatial information, we leverage the common sense reasoning ability of large language models and supplement them with rigorous human verification, This approach offers greater scalability compared to purely manual annotation while maintaining high standards of accuracy, completeness, and diversity, quantified through inter annotator agreement and performance on two benchmark tasks audio based 3D visual grounding and audio based robotic zeroshot navigation.

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features.

An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\uff08BBG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u4efb\u52a1\u67e5\u8be2\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u7269\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u524d\u6cbf\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u4efb\u52a1\u67e5\u8be2\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "BBG\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM.

From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \\emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \\emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \\emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass.

However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLayerPipe2\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcLayerPipe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b58\u50a8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u671f\u5de5\u4f5cLayerPipe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5404\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u53d8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u91cd\u5b9a\u65f6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u5bfcLayerPipe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u6cd5\u63d2\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b58\u50a8\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6784\u5efaLayerPipe\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5b58\u50a8\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones.

Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns; while the readout module achieves biological fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms.

Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\\propto \u03b3^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\\propto \u03b3^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86\u4ee5\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8bba\u636e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5f97\u51fa\u6b64\u8bbe\u5b9a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Scion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9\u6279\u91cf\u603b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u8be5\u8bbe\u5b9a\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e00\u76f4\u88ab\u8bbe\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u6709\u89c2\u70b9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e94\u8bbe\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9\u6b64\u5047\u8bbe\u5b58\u7591\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u5408\u9002\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1Scion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bf9\u6279\u91cf\u603b\u66f4\u65b0\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0cScion\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u52a8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware.

Recent works find that non\\-Euclidean pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\\-curvature or subspace\\-partitioning methods, PR\\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\\-temporal and Euclidean\\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties. Finally, a geometric properties\\-preserved Pseudo\\-Riemannian Capsule Classifier is developed to project capsule embeddings to tangent spaces and use curvature\\-weighted softmax for classification.

These experimental results demonstrate that prototype-based feature transformation can enhance both accuracy and robustness in time series classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684SPROCKET\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6570UCR\u548cUEA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cMR - HY - SP\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u5377\u79ef\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7ecf\u5178\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565SPROCKET\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaMR - HY - SP\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "SPROCKET\u5728\u591a\u6570UCR\u548cUEA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cMR - HY - SP\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u5377\u79ef\u96c6\u6210HYDRA - MR\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6536\u655b\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u7248\u672c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u6c42\u5bfc\u6784\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u6c42\u5bfc\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u52a0\u901f\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c06\u5c0f\u6ce2\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u6027\u878d\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684PINNs\u6240\u9700\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c115%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50PINNs\u5feb3 - 5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MARINE (Multi-Agent Recursive IN-context Enhancement), a theoretically grounded framework that reconceptualizes test-time reasoning as iterative refinement of a persistent reference trajectory, fundamentally departing from conventional one-shot or multi-sample paradigms. The MARINE refinement operator systematically converts a base model's pass@N capabilities into near-optimal pass@1 performance. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes that minimal feasible batches maximize expected performance gains under fixed invocation budgets, while logarithmically growing batch schedules ensure continuous improvement without computational constraints. Comprehensive evaluation on the BrowserComp-ZH benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art results, with a 685B-parameter implementation achieving 46.0% pass@1 accuracy. Meanwhile, MARINE establishes a new paradigm for parameter-efficient reasoning: an 80B-parameter model augmented with MARINE matches the performance of standalone 1000B-parameter agents, reducing parameter requirements by over an order of magnitude. Notably, within a fixed computational budget, the proposed MARINE delivers higher-quality samples to alignment and optimization processes than traditional sampling-and-ranking strategies.

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJARF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u659c\u68ee\u6797\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u62df\u5408\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u6216\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u5916\u79ef\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\u5904\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u5e38\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u659c\u68ee\u6797\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u659c\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u6811\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c16\u9510\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMAN\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u83b7\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c16\u9510\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ed1\u585e\u77e9\u9635\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u65bd\u52a0\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u201cMAN\u201d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u7684\u8303\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian R\u00e9nyi DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy-utility trade-off.

Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u7ec6\u83cc\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u57fa\u51c6\uff08B3\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u751f\u7269\u6050\u6016\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u83b7\u53d6\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u672c\u524d\u6cbf\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "B3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "B3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u91cd\u70b9\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives.

Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%.

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7edf\u4e00\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\uff08TD\uff09\u8bef\u5dee\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u5168\u5c40L2\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0eTD\u8bef\u5dee\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8eb2\u907f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs.

Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant.

Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label.

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDTW - TL\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u9274\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5e94\u529b - \u5e94\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u4ef6\u9274\u5b9a\u5bf9\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5e94\u529b - \u5e94\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1DTW - TL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528DTW\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u91d1\u5c5e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u57df\uff0c\u7528LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "DTW - TL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u627e\u51fa\u805a\u5408\u7269\u4e0e\u91d1\u5c5e\u6700\u5339\u914d\u9879\u9009\u5355\u4e00\u6e90\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u4ee5\u4e09\u79cd\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DTW - TL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u96f6\u4ef6\u9274\u5b9a\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u805a\u5408\u7269\u5e94\u529b - \u5e94\u53d8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u3002"}}

To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart.

This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks.

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLEAP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLEAP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u672c\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLEAP\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6dfb\u52a0\u63d0\u793a\u5230\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cLEAP\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u7406\u60f3\u63d0\u793a\u3002"}}

Existing solutions fail: signature systems are brittle, anomaly methods lack actionability, and fully cloud-hosted LLMs raise latency, cost, and privacy concerns. We propose AIDR, a hybrid cloud-edge framework that addresses this trade-off through constrained information-density optimization. The core innovation is gradient-based compression of reasoning chains to retain only decision-critical steps--minimal evidence sufficient to justify predictions while respecting token and latency budgets. We demonstrate that this approach preserves decision-relevant information while minimizing complexity. We construct compact datasets by distilling alerts into 3-5 high-information bullets (68% token reduction), train domain-specialized experts via LoRA, and deploy a cloud-edge architecture: a cloud LLM routes alerts to on-premises experts generating SOAR-ready JSON.

While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

For linear approximation, TD($\u03bb$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state values. We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($\u03bb$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon.

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model.

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u63d0\u51faContextGAN\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextGAN\uff0c\u5373\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\u96c6\u6210\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ContextGAN\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u9700\u9075\u5faa\u663e\u5f0f\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

Classical metrics such as PESQ and POLQA approximate human mean opinion scores (MOS) but require carefully controlled conditions and expensive listening tests, while learning-based models such as NISQA regress MOS and multiple perceptual dimensions from waveforms or spectrograms, achieving high correlation with subjective ratings yet remaining rigid: they do not support interactive, natural-language queries and do not natively provide textual rationales. In this work, we introduce SpeechQualityLLM, a multimodal speech quality question-answering (QA) system that couples an audio encoder with a language model and is trained on the NISQA corpus using template-based question-answer pairs covering overall MOS and four perceptual dimensions (noisiness, coloration, discontinuity, and loudness) in both single-ended (degraded only) and double-ended (degraded plus clean reference) setups. Instead of directly regressing scores, our system is supervised to generate textual answers from which numeric predictions are parsed and evaluated with standard regression and ranking metrics; on held-out NISQA clips, the double-ended model attains a MOS mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41 with Pearson correlation of 0.86, with competitive performance on dimension-wise tasks. Beyond these quantitative gains, it offers a flexible natural-language interface in which the language model acts as an audio quality expert: practitioners can query arbitrary aspects of degradations, prompt the model to emulate different listener profiles to capture human variability and produce diverse but plausible judgments rather than a single deterministic score, and thereby reduce reliance on large-scale crowdsourced tests and their monetary cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edfSpeechQualityLLM\uff0c\u5728NISQA\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f73\u4e14\u6709\u7075\u6d3b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9700\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6587\u672c\u7406\u7531\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728NISQA\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7528\u6a21\u677f\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7684NISQA\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\uff0cMOS\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.41\uff0c\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u4e3a0.86\uff0c\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "SpeechQualityLLM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4f17\u5305\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLevAtt\u653b\u51fb\u63ed\u793a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65e0\u76d2\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fbLevAtt\u5206\u6790\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LevAtt\u653b\u51fb\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u62b5\u5fa1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics.

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation.

Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context.

This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors.

We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs.

The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials.

However, sampling methods such as diffusion posterior sampling or likelihood annealing suffer from long reconstruction times and the need for parameter tuning.

To overcome the issue of slow convergence, preconditioning is used. The method is trained on fastMRI data and tested on retrospectively undersampled brain data of a healthy volunteer.\n  Results: For posterior sampling in Cartesian and non-Cartesian accelerated MRI the new approach outperforms annealed sampling in terms of reconstruction speed and sample quality.\n  Conclusion: The proposed exact likelihood with preconditioning enables rapid and reliable posterior sampling across various MRI reconstruction tasks without the need for parameter tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8eMRI\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9000\u706b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eULA\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u548c\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u5404\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u76f8\u4e58\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u514b\u670d\u6536\u655b\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728fastMRI\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u8111\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u548c\u975e\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u52a0\u901fMRI\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u9000\u706b\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u4f3c\u7136\u4e0e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cdMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges.

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts.

Traditional detection methods that rely on regular expressions, fingerprint features, and high-entropy calculations often suffer from high false-positive rates. This not only reduces detection efficiency but also significantly increases the manual screening burden on developers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex tasks, offering a novel technological perspective for sensitive information detection. In response to these challenges, we propose Argus, a multi-agent collaborative framework for detecting sensitive information. Argus employs a three-tier detection mechanism that integrates key content, file context, and project reference relationships to effectively reduce false positives and enhance overall detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Argus in real-world repository environments, we developed two new benchmarks, one to assess genuine leak detection capabilities and another to evaluate false-positive filtering performance. Experimental results show that Argus achieves up to 94.86% accuracy in leak detection, with a precision of 96.36%, recall of 94.64%, and an F1 score of 0.955.

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53d8\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4e14\u4fe1\u53f7\u5fae\u5999\u4f46\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6545\u5f00\u5c55\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u767d\u76d2\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u4f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u71b5\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u71b5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bGlaze\u548cNightshade\u5728\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u53d8\u5f62\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task.

Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is the process of interpreting human intent through various input modalities, such as visual data (images and videos) and bio-signals. Bio-signals are widely used in HGR due to their ability to be captured non-invasively via sensors placed on the arm. Among these, surface electromyography (sEMG), which measures the electrical activity of muscles, is the most extensively studied modality. However, less-explored alternatives such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide complementary information on subtle muscle movements, which makes them valuable for gesture recognition. In this study, we investigate the potential of using IMU signals from different muscle groups to capture user intent. Our results demonstrate that IMU signals contain sufficient information to serve as the sole input sensor for static gesture recognition. Moreover, we compare different muscle groups and check the quality of pattern recognition on individual muscle groups. We further found that tendon-induced micro-movement captured by IMUs is a major contributor to static gesture recognition. We believe that leveraging muscle micro-movement information can enhance the usability of prosthetic arms for amputees.

By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faContextDrag\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d6\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u542b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u8d85\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d6\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ContextDrag\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cfVAE\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Context - preserving Token Injection (CTI)\u548cPosition - Consistent Attention (PCA)\u3002CTI\u901a\u8fc7Latent - space Reverse Mapping (LRM)\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u566a\u53c2\u8003\u7279\u5f81\uff1bPCA\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u91cd\u53e0\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728DragBench - SR\u548cDragBench - DR\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextDrag\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d6\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u653e\u7684Web\u539f\u751f\u5e73\u53f0Visionary\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d82\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e3DGS\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u6c89\u91cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u6469\u64e6\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eWebGPU\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5408\u7ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09.js\u63d2\u4ef6\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u540c3DGS\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0b\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709Web\u67e5\u770b\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Visionary\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e3DGS\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u969c\u788d\u3002"}}

Recently, with the rising importance of responsible AI, the question of fairness in link-analysis algorithms has gained traction. In this paper, we present a new approach for incorporating group fairness into the PageRank algorithm by reweighting the transition probabilities in the underlying transition matrix. We formulate the problem of achieving fair PageRank by seeking to minimize the fairness loss, which is the difference between the original group-wise PageRank distribution and a target PageRank distribution. We further define a group-adapted fairness notion, which accounts for group homophily by considering random walks with group-biased restart for each group. Since the fairness loss is non-convex, we propose an efficient projected gradient-descent method for computing locally-optimal edge weights. Unlike earlier approaches, we do not recommend adding new edges to the network, nor do we adjust the restart vector. Instead, we keep the topology of the underlying network unchanged and only modify the relative importance of existing edges.

We introduce \\textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \\textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations.

We evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning models to estimate comfort based on gaze features.

A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals.

However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches.

To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation.

However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing.

While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning (\"mind\") with robot action (\"hand\"). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control.

However, the inherent uncertainty of aircraft trajectories and traffic flows poses significant challenges to both prediction accuracy and trustworthiness. Therefore, prediction models should not only provide point estimates of aircraft landing times but also the uncertainties associated with these predictions. Furthermore, aircraft trajectories are frequently influenced by the presence of nearby aircraft through air traffic control interventions such as radar vectoring. Consequently, landing time prediction models must account for multi-agent interactions in the airspace. In this work, we propose a probabilistic multi-agent aircraft landing time prediction framework that provides the landing times of multiple aircraft as distributions. We evaluate the proposed framework using an air traffic surveillance dataset collected from the terminal airspace of the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than the baselines and quantifies the associated uncertainties of its outcomes.

While most research has examined how general-purpose GenAI can support writing, fewer studies have investigated how students interact with pedagogically designed systems across different phases of the writing process. To address this gap, we evaluated a GenAI-driven essay-writing assistant (EWA) designed to support higher education students in argumentative writing. Drawing on 1,282 interaction logs from 32 undergraduates during a two-hour writing session, Sequential Pattern Mining and K-Means clustering were used to identify behavioral patterns. Two clusters emerged: Cluster 1 emphasized outline planning and essay structure, while Cluster 2 focused on content development. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed a moderate effect size (r = 0.36) in the essay Organization dimension, with Cluster 1 showing higher scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that students with better performance actively wrote and shared essay sections with EWA for feedback, rather than interacted passively by asking questions. These findings suggest implications for teaching and system design.

Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

Their interior is fully convective, different from that of the partly-convective Sun-like stars. Magnetic field generation process beneath the surface of ultracool dwarfs is still poorly understood and controversial. To increase samples of active ultracool dwarfs significantly, we have identified 962 ultracool dwarfs in the latest LAMOST data release, DR11. We also simulate the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) low-resolution slitless spectra by degrading the LAMOST spectra. A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs.

This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts.

We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors.

This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

However, operating in contested environments requires solving a complex trade-off, including maximizing system throughput while ensuring collision avoidance and resilience against adversarial jamming. Existing heuristic-based approaches often struggle to find effective solutions due to the dynamic and multi-objective nature of this problem. This paper formulates this challenge as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem, solved using the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework. Our approach employs a centralized critic that uses global state information to guide decentralized actors which operate using only local observations. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms heuristic baselines, increasing the total system throughput by approximately 50% while simultaneously achieving a near-zero collision rate. A key finding is that the agents develop an emergent anti-jamming strategy without explicit programming. They learn to intelligently position themselves to balance the trade-off between mitigating interference from jammers and maintaining effective communication links with ground users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528CTDE\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fd8\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7ee7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\uff08CTDE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea650%\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u5e72\u6270\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002"}}

Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging.

It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting.

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores.

To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal.

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings.

While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loose YARA rules for coarse-grained filtering, optimized for high recall. The second stage utilizes an ML classifier to filter out false positives from the first stage's output. To overcome data scarcity, the system leverages Simula, a seedless synthetic data generation framework, enabling security analysts to create high-quality training datasets without extensive data science expertise or pre-labeled examples. A continuous feedback loop incorporates real-time investigation results to adaptively tune the ML model, preventing rule degradation.\n  This proposed model with active learning has been rigorously tested for a prolonged time in a production environment spanning tens of thousands of systems.

However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_\u03c7$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPrivTune\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u7528\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5b58\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrivTune\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c6\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u5165\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6309token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6297\u516d\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RoBERTa\u5728\u65af\u5766\u798f\u60c5\u611f\u6811\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPrivTune\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u81f310%\uff0c\u6548\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d3.33%\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivTune\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Efficiently identifying specific enzymes from vast protein libraries is essential for advancing biocatalysis. Traditional computational methods for enzyme screening and retrieval are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods focus solely on the interaction between enzymes and reactions, overlooking the inherent hierarchical relationships within each domain. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. FGW-CLIP incorporates multiple alignments, including inter-domain alignment between reactions and enzymes and intra-domain alignment within enzymes and reactions. By introducing a tailored regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, which enhances information integration across these domains. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of FGW-CLIP in challenging enzyme-reaction tasks. On the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, FGW-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme virtual screening, as measured by BEDROC and EF metrics. Moreover, FGW-CLIP consistently outperforms across all three splits of ReactZyme, the largest enzyme-reaction benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization to novel enzymes and reactions.

In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories.

In jazz, musicians often improvise across predefined chord progressions (leadsheets). How do we assess the creativity of jazz improvisations? And can we capture this in automated metrics for creativity for current LLM-based generative systems? Demonstration of emotional involvement is closely linked with creativity in improvisation. Analysing musical audio, can we detect emotional involvement? This study hypothesises that if an improvisation contains more evidence of emotion-laden content, it is more likely to be recognised as creative. An embeddings-based method is proposed for capturing the emotional content in musical improvisations, using a psychologically-grounded classification of musical characteristics associated with emotions. Resulting 'emovectors' are analysed to test the above hypothesis, comparing across multiple improvisations.

In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks.

To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \\textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincar\u00e9 ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions.

However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint.

Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains.

The relevance of such experiments relies on dimensional analysis and the principle of dynamic similarity. However, transferring controllers to full-scale systems often requires additional tuning.

With this reformulation, the closed-loop behavior of an optimized controller transfers directly to a new, dynamically similar system. Additionally, the dimensionless formulation allows for the use of data from systems of different scales during parameter optimization.

In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system.

Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front.

We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics.

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56f4\u7ed5RAG\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668RAGLens\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6545\u5bfb\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u89e3\u5f00\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5f15\u5165RAGLens\u3002", "result": "RAGLens\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u4e8b\u540e\u7f13\u89e3RAG\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost.

We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency.

Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u6210\u548c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u82e5\u65e0\u5fc5\u8981\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5408\u9002\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u6bd4\u975e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, transmitting raw sensor data to a centralized server for machine learning (ML) model training raises serious privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling decentralized model training without exposing sensitive local data. Yet, applying FL in underground mining presents unique challenges: (i) Adversaries may eavesdrop on shared model updates to launch model inversion or membership inference attacks, compromising data privacy and operational safety; (ii) Non-IID data distributions across mines and sensor noise can hinder model convergence. To address these issues, we propose FedMining--a privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for underground mining. FedMining introduces two core innovations: (1) a Decentralized Functional Encryption (DFE) scheme that keeps local models encrypted, thwarting unauthorized access and inference attacks; and (2) a balancing aggregation mechanism to mitigate data heterogeneity and enhance convergence. Evaluations on real-world mining datasets demonstrate FedMining's ability to safeguard privacy while maintaining high model accuracy and achieving rapid convergence with reduced communication and computation overhead. These advantages make FedMining both secure and practical for real-time underground safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u81f3\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3ML\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFedMining\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3FL\u5728\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0cFL\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u4e0b\u91c7\u77ff\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u624b\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u975eIID\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u96be\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedMining\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bDFE\u65b9\u6848\u52a0\u5bc6\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91c7\u77ff\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedMining\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "FedMining\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Federated satellite learning (FSL) enables joint model training without sharing raw data, but suffers from slow convergence due to intermittent connectivity and introduces critical trust challenges--where biased or falsified updates can arise across satellite constellations, including those injected through cyberattacks on inter-satellite or satellite-ground communication links. We propose OrbitChain, a blockchain-backed framework that empowers trustworthy multi-vendor collaboration in LEO networks. OrbitChain (i) offloads consensus to high-altitude platforms (HAPs) with greater computational capacity, (ii) ensures transparent, auditable provenance of model updates from different orbits owned by different vendors, and (iii) prevents manipulated or incomplete contributions from affecting global FSL model aggregation. Extensive simulations show that OrbitChain reduces computational and communication overhead while improving privacy, security, and global model accuracy. Its permissioned proof-of-authority ledger finalizes over 1000 blocks with sub-second latency (0.16,s, 0.26,s, 0.35,s for 1-of-5, 3-of-5, and 5-of-5 quorums). Moreover, OrbitChain reduces convergence time by up to 30 hours on real satellite datasets compared to single-vendor, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, multi-vendor learning.

We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes.
