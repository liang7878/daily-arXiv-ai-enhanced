### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍了自进化AI代理STELLA，它能在生物医学基准测试中达到先进水平，且性能随经验提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据、工具和文献快速增长使研究碎片化，现有的AI代理依赖静态手动工具集，缺乏适应性和扩展性。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，通过进化模板库和动态工具海洋两个核心机制自主提升能力。

Result: 在一系列生物医学基准测试中达到先进准确率，如在Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine中得分约26%，且性能随经验提升。

Conclusion: STELLA是迈向可学习和成长的AI代理系统的重要进步，能动态扩展专业知识以加速生物医学发现。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出轻量级特征选择方法HCVR，结合P2P和P2T相关性降维，用多数投票决定特征取舍，应用于SPAMBASE数据集，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找一种有效的特征选择方法，消除冗余特征、保留相关特征以实现降维。

Method: 提出HCVR方法，结合非迭代和迭代过滤方法，采用向后消除策略，用多数投票决定特征去留，利用特征间及特征与目标的相关性阈值。

Result: HCVR应用于SPAMBASE数据集，相比传统非迭代和迭代技术，性能有所提升。

Conclusion: HCVR方法在特征选择和降维方面有效，能提升不同分类器的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

### [3] [Strategic Intelligence in Large Language Models: Evidence from evolutionary Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02618)
*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过进化版迭代囚徒困境锦标赛研究大语言模型（LLMs）在竞争环境中的策略推理能力，发现LLMs具有竞争力且有独特策略特征，还会对决策进行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否是一种新型战略智能，能否在竞争环境中对目标进行推理。

Method: 开展进化版迭代囚徒困境锦标赛，让经典策略与来自OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的大语言模型代理对抗，并改变终止概率增加复杂性。

Result: LLMs竞争力强，能在复杂生态中存活和繁衍；不同公司的模型有独特“策略指纹”；模型会对时间范围和对手策略进行推理并影响决策。

Conclusion: 该研究将经典博弈论与机器心理学联系起来，为不确定条件下的算法决策提供了细致的视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

### [4] [Reasoning on a Budget: A Survey of Adaptive and Controllable Test-Time Compute in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02076)
*Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Derek Li,Qianyi Sun,Soumyasundar Pal,Zhanguang Zhang,Yaochen Hu,Rohan Deepak Ajwani,Antonios Valkanas,Raika Karimi,Peng Cheng,Yunzhou Wang,Pengyi Liao,Hanrui Huang,Bin Wang,Jianye Hao,Mark Coates*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文全面综述提升大语言模型推理计算效率的高效测试时间计算（TTC）策略，介绍分类法、进行基准测试，讨论趋势与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型推理效率低，固定推理时间计算无法适配任务复杂度，需提升计算效率。

Method: 引入两层分类法区分L1可控性和L2适应性方法，对领先专有大语言模型在不同数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 突出推理性能和令牌使用之间的关键权衡，强调TTC方法的实际控制、适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 讨论了混合思维模型等新兴趋势，确定未来让大语言模型更高效、鲁棒和响应式面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

### [5] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Michał Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SciGym基准评估大语言模型在开放式科学发现任务中的实验设计和分析能力，评估显示模型性能随系统复杂度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大语言模型科学能力的工作未测试实验设计和结果解读能力，湿实验室实验成本过高。

Method: 引入SciGym基准，通过运行生物系统的干实验室，利用系统生物学标记语言编码的模型生成模拟数据进行评估。

Result: 在137个小系统上评估6个前沿大语言模型，发布350个系统，能力更强的模型表现更好，但所有模型性能随系统复杂度增加显著下降。

Conclusion: 大语言模型代理的科学能力有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [6] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI能否从神经科学学习，整合相关文献并提出促进NeuroAI领域发展的议程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型训练成本高、速度慢，而动物能持续适应环境变化，现实世界中的AI系统需具备类似能力，因此探讨AI从神经科学学习的可能性。

Method: 整合AI中持续和上下文学习的文献与行为任务中学习的神经科学文献。

Result: 提出如何利用神经科学见解推动AI发展及神经科学从AI学习的议程。

Conclusion: 此研究有助于推动NeuroAI领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文用独立多智能体Q学习算法研究空间囚徒困境中稀释和移动性的影响，展示算法建模能力，观察到多种效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究表明静态智能体在空间囚徒困境游戏中可通过多种机制学会合作，本文旨在研究稀释和移动性在空间囚徒困境中的影响。

Method: 使用独立多智能体Q学习算法，定义不同可能动作。

Result: 观察到一系列效应，如固定更新规则的游戏与学习规则的游戏在性质上等价，以及定义多动作时种群间出现共生互利效应。

Conclusion: 该算法具有建模不同博弈论场景的通用性和基准测试潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [8] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能系统决策的有效性和公平性判断很重要，机器学习中常见解决下游分类器偏差的方法存在数据偏差问题，因此研究利用审计研究数据改进自动化招聘算法。

Method: 研究如何使用审计研究数据来训练和评估自动化招聘算法，引入基于个体治疗效果估计方法的干预措施。

Result: 审计研究数据显示常见公平干预方法用传统指标看似实现公平，但实际有近10%差异，新干预措施可进一步减少算法歧视。

Conclusion: 审计研究数据可提升自动化招聘算法的训练和评估能力，新干预措施能减少算法歧视。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究数据多样化策略提升大语言模型数学推理能力，评估三种方法并提出DTS，结果表明多样化数据可提升性能，DTS效果好且开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决偏好学习中数学推理的持续挑战，探索数据多样化策略对大语言模型数学推理能力的提升作用。

Method: 评估温度采样、思维链提示和蒙特卡罗树搜索三种数据生成方法，提出DTS方法系统分解问题为不同推理路径。

Result: 策略性多样化偏好数据可大幅提升模型数学推理性能，DTS在GSM8K和MATH上有增益，开销仅为基线的1.03倍，MCTS成本高且回报低。

Conclusion: 与传统方法相比，结构化探索多样化解决方法能为数学对齐创建更有效的偏好数据。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究LLM角色扮演代理陈述的信念与实际行为的一致性，发现两者存在系统不一致性，强调需明确信念与行为何时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM用于人类行为研究生成合成数据，确保其输出与分配角色一致成关键问题，需研究其陈述信念与实际行为的对应情况。

Method: 建立评估框架，用增强版GenAgents角色库和信任游戏，引入信念 - 行为一致性指标，研究不同因素影响，探索施加理论先验的可行性。

Result: 在个体和群体层面，LLM陈述（或施加）的信念与角色扮演模拟结果存在系统不一致性，即使模型看似编码合理信念，也可能无法一致应用。

Conclusion: 需要确定LLM陈述的信念何时与模拟行为一致，以便在行为研究中恰当使用基于LLM的代理。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

*Jiajie Jin,Xiaoxi Li,Guanting Dong,Yuyao Zhang,Yutao Zhu,Yang Zhao,Hongjin Qian,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出HiRA分层框架，分离战略规划与专业执行，实验显示其在多方面优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG管道难以有效满足复杂信息需求，现有推理方法用单模型处理规划和执行，存在效率低和可扩展性有限问题。

Method: 引入HiRA分层框架，将复杂搜索任务分解为子任务，分配给特定领域代理，通过结构化机制整合结果。

Result: 在四个复杂跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA显著优于现有RAG和基于代理的系统，在答案质量和系统效率上有提升。

Conclusion: 解耦规划和执行对多步信息搜索任务有效。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ignorejjj/HiRA.

*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 介绍自动系统NL2FLOW生成规划问题并评估生成计划质量，以自动工作流生成领域为例测试大语言模型，分析结果得出相关结论，强调动态理解模型局限性重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提升大语言模型规划和推理能力时可扩展、可靠数据生成和评估的瓶颈问题。

Method: 引入NL2FLOW系统，在自动工作流生成领域生成2296个问题的数据集，评估多个开源指令微调大语言模型。

Result: 最高性能模型生成有效计划成功率86%，生成最优计划成功率69%；回归分析表明问题特征对计划生成的影响取决于模型和提示设计；自然语言转JSON表示计划的最高成功率低于直接生成有效计划的最高成功率。

Conclusion: 动态理解大语言模型的局限性及系统揭示这些局限的工具对发挥其作为智能问题解决者的全部潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有信念修正领域新提案多但对现有方法分析少，研究多依赖公设，本文探讨信念修正机制应具备的能力，如可塑性、等同性等，并证明多种修正机制具备特定能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念修正领域缺乏对现有方法的分析，公设仅作为句法特征，且约束特定修正实例，不能满足应用中对信念状态的多样需求。

Method: 分析公设的局限性，提出信念修正机制应具备的多种能力，如可塑性、等同性、教条性等，并对多种修正机制进行研究。

Result: 证明了词法、自然、受限等多种修正机制具备某些特定能力。

Conclusion: 信念修正机制应具备多种能力，而不仅仅受公设约束。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Motivation: 解决LLM基关键字生成方法在依赖数据、缺乏在线多目标性能监控优化和关键字选择质量控制方面的局限，实现关键字决策自动化。

Method: 提出OMS框架，具备即时性、多目标性和自我反思性。

Result: 在基准测试和实际广告活动中，OMS优于现有方法，消融和人工评估证实各组件有效性和生成关键字质量。

Conclusion: OMS框架有效克服了LLM基关键字生成方法的局限，可用于广告关键字决策。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine

as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in
advancing automated machine learning.

Result: 通过大量实验证明了DynamiCare的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了基于大语言模型智能体的动态临床决策首个基准。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

Motivation: 当前长推理模型存在过度思考问题，现有模型在解决问题前多采用通用推理过程，需进一步缓解过度思考现象。

Method: 提出TH2T两阶段微调策略，先通过在模型输出前缀引入难度催眠干预推理轨迹，结合长短推理数据集提升模型对任务难度的敏感度；再将冗余催眠扩展到内部推理过程，引导模型识别推理步骤中的冗余结构。

Result: 在7B/14B/32B模型上实验，TH2T显著降低推理成本，简单任务超70%，困难任务超40%，输出有难度感知能力且冗余减少。

Conclusion: TH2T策略有效缓解长推理模型过度思考问题，降低推理成本同时保持性能稳定。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Result: 实验达到91%的平衡准确率，约85%脱离学生被正确检测。

Conclusion: 提供高预测性能和可解释框架，讨论如何设计及时干预措施以减少在线学习中自愿任务的脱离情况。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Motivation: 非精确抽象会引入近似误差，导致无法收敛到抽象空间的最优动作，Xu等人提出最终应丢弃抽象，本文旨在提出更好的抽象丢弃方案。

Method: 提出OGA - IAAD和OGA - CAD两种新的抽象丢弃方案。

Result: 新方案能显著提升性能，且不会像Xu的方法那样导致性能下降。

Conclusion: OGA - IAAD适用于时间关键场景，OGA - CAD可在相同迭代次数下提升MCTS性能。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Result: Bourbaki (7B)在PutnamBench上解决了26个问题。

Conclusion: Bourbaki (7B)在该规模模型上取得了新的最优结果。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Result: 定义了KPE的核心原则，区分了与相关概念的差异。

Conclusion: KPE可作为未来人机协作的基础方法论，有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Conclusion: KERAP为零样本医疗诊断预测提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Conclusion: ABC 准则有助于使智能体评估更加严谨，减少因基准测试问题导致的性能评估偏差。

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在近失奖励问题和探索停滞问题，影响大语言模型训练效率和探索能力，需要改进。

Method: 提出StepHint算法，利用多级逐步提示，通过自适应分区方法将强模型生成的有效推理链划分为推理步骤，提供多级提示引导模型探索。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于其他RLVR增强方法，在域外基准测试中也表现出色，有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: StepHint算法能有效解决当前RLVR方法面临的问题，提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### [32] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

TL;DR: 提出NCDE - DeepONet解决从稀疏不规则数据中学习时变偏微分方程解算子的难题，经基准测试验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确从稀疏不规则数据中学习时变偏微分方程解算子具有挑战性，现有方法如循环DeepONet扩展和神经ODE代理存在局限性。

Method: 引入NCDE - DeepONet，在分支中嵌入神经受控微分方程（NCDE），用显式时空坐标增强主干，NCDE编码负载历史，主干在任意时空位置探测潜路径。

Result: 在瞬态泊松、弹性动力学和热弹性问题的基准测试中，框架展现出鲁棒性和准确性，能实现几乎即时的解预测。

Conclusion: 受控动力学为瞬态力学中的高保真算子学习提供了有原则且高效的基础。

Abstract: Accurately learning solution operators for time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) from sparse and irregular data remains a
challenging task. Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time
limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while
neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We
introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a
Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the
trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load
history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated
input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes
different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then
probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the
overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes
and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation.
Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems
confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant
solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a
principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in
transient mechanics.

Result: 发现与基于度的零模型存在持续偏差，存在用户行为模仿现象，用户偏好更活跃的同行；不同类型用户间的异质连接加强了网络拓扑并提高了弹性。

Conclusion: 社区货币网络有独特的结构和动态特性，用户行为模仿及异质连接对网络有积极影响。

Abstract: Community currency networks are made up of individuals and or companies that
share some physical or social characteristics and engage in economic
transactions using a virtual currency. This paper investigates the structural
and dynamic properties of such mutual credit systems through a case study of
Sardex, a community currency initiated and mainly operating in Sardinia, Italy.
The transaction network is modeled as a directed weighted graph and analyzed
through a graph theoretic framework focused on the analysis of strongly
connected components, condensed representations, and behavioral connectivity
patterns. Emphasis is placed on understanding the evolution of the network's
core and peripheral structures over a three year period, with attention to
temporal contraction, flow asymmetries, and structural fragmentation depending
on different user types. Our findings reveal persistent deviations from degree
based null models and suggest the presence of behavioral imitation,
specifically, a user preference for more active peers. We further assess the
impact of heterogeneous connections between different type of users, which
strengthen the network topology and enhance its resilience.

Abstract: The industrialization of catalytic processes hinges on the availability of
reliable kinetic models for design, optimization, and control. Traditional
mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven
approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed
Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical
constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the
search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for
model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust
uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,
which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals.
Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several
catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model
fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential
for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction
engineering.

Motivation: 房地产公司租约时间表缺乏标准化表格格式，导致数据集成效率低，现有自动集成方法存在模式膨胀等问题。

Method: 提出基于模板的混合模式匹配器，结合模式和实例度量，用匈牙利算法确定全局最优分配。

Result: 与手动标注的真实数据对比，网格搜索优化后F1分数达0.881，空值率45.7%；在另一组数据上，ALITE的F1分数为0.712，空值率75.6%。

Conclusion: 结合结构化业务知识与混合匹配可产生更实用、符合业务的模式映射，后续可扩展匹配器支持复杂复合表。

Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real
estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing
automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like
ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes
and limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based
schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined
target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and
instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal
assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a
manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid
search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null
percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar
column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results
suggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can
yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes
cleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the
matcher to support complex, composite tables.

Abstract: SAKURAONE is a managed high performance computing (HPC) cluster developed and
operated by the SAKURA Internet Research Center. It reinforces the ``KOKARYOKU
PHY'' configuration of bare-metal GPU servers and is designed as a cluster
computing resource optimized for advanced workloads, including large language

Motivation: PCM需仔细调参、可能降低服务可用性且检测慢，因此研究SCM替代方案。

Method: 提出Kubernetes的SCM方法设计、实现和评估，用SockShop基准进行六次实验对比SCM和PCM的服务可用性。

Result: SCM无需调参，检测容器故障比PCM快86%，检测容器就绪时间相当且资源开销有限，PCM会错误检测故障使服务可用性降低4%。

Conclusion: 编排器应提供SCM功能以实现比PCM更快的故障检测，且无错误检测和无需仔细调参。

Abstract: Microservices are often deployed and managed by a container orchestrator that
can detect and fix failures to maintain the service availability critical in
many applications. In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator
periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires
careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect
container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring
(SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We
present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for
Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by
a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM
over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that
polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than
PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource
overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces
service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features
for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful
tuning.

Conclusion: 所提机制在复杂云计算系统中有效且具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fault root cause identification in
cloud computing environments. The difficulty arises from complex system
structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve
this problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer
learning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module
and a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from
the source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's
discriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The
model incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are
lacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.
This enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate
the stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,
experiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class
imbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key
metrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger
discriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and
significant structural differences in the target domain, the model still
maintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical
value of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems.

Conclusion: Flotilla是构建、比较、部署联邦学习策略及进行系统研究优化的有力候选。

Abstract: With the recent improvements in mobile and edge computing and rising concerns
of data privacy, Federated Learning(FL) has rapidly gained popularity as a
privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning methodology. Several FL
frameworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus
on validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation
but not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to
meaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current
frameworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous
aggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client
and server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL
framework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose
various synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the
DNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates
out the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We
demonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL
strategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and
server-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to
rapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource
usage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or
better than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It
also scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This
positions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,
compare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and
optimizations.

CSCS developed Alps, a next-generation HPC infrastructure designed with a
transformative principle: resources operate as independent endpoints within a
high-speed network. This architecture enables the creation of independent
tenant-specific and platform-specific services, tailored to diverse scientific
requirements.
  Alps incorporates heterogeneous hardware, including CPUs and GPUs,
interconnected by a high-performance Slingshot network, and offers a modular
storage system. A key innovation is the versatile software-defined cluster
(vCluster) technology, which bridges cloud and HPC paradigms. By abstracting
infrastructure, service management, and user environments into distinct layers,
vClusters allow for customized platforms that support diverse workloads.
Current platforms on Alps serve various scientific domains, including numerical
weather prediction, and AI research.

Result: 在真实测试平台实验，相比基线，推理速度提升1.36 - 1.77倍。

Conclusion: FlowSpec框架能显著提升不同模型和配置下的推理速度。

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

$G$. We present a randomized algorithm with a running time of
$\tilde{O}\big(\ell \cdot n^{1 + \frac{1}{\ell - \varepsilon}}\big)$ that
returns a cycle of length at most $ 2\ell \left\lceil \frac{g}{2} \right\rceil
- 2 \left\lfloor \varepsilon \left\lceil \frac{g}{2} \right\rceil
\right\rfloor, $ where $\ell \geq 2$ is an integer and $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$,
for every graph with $g = polylog(n)$.
  Our algorithm generalizes an algorithm of Kadria \etal{} [SODA'22] that
computes a cycle of length at most $4\left\lceil \frac{g}{2} \right\rceil -
2\left\lfloor \varepsilon \left\lceil \frac{g}{2} \right\rceil \right\rfloor $
in $\tilde{O}\big(n^{1 + \frac{1}{2 - \varepsilon}}\big)$ time. Kadria \etal{}
presented also an algorithm that finds a cycle of length at most $ 2\ell
\left\lceil \frac{g}{2} \right\rceil $ in $\tilde{O}\big(n^{1 +
\frac{1}{\ell}}\big)$ time, where $\ell$ must be an integer. Our algorithm
generalizes this algorithm, as well, by replacing the integer parameter $\ell$
in the running time exponent with a real-valued parameter $\ell - \varepsilon$,
thereby offering greater flexibility in parameter selection and enabling a
broader spectrum of combinations between running times and cycle lengths.
  We also show that for sparse graphs a better tradeoff is possible, by
presenting an $\tilde{O}(\ell\cdot m^{1+1/(\ell-\varepsilon)})$ time randomized
algorithm that returns a cycle of length at most $2\ell(\lfloor
\frac{g-1}{2}\rfloor) - 2(\lfloor \varepsilon \lfloor \frac{g-1}{2}\rfloor
\rfloor+1)$, where $\ell\geq 3$ is an integer and $\varepsilon\in [0,1)$, for
every graph with $g=polylog(n)$.
  To obtain our algorithms we develop several techniques and introduce a formal
definition of hybrid cycle detection algorithms. [...]

Abstract: Finding all the words on a Boggle board is a classic computer programming
problem. With a fast Boggle solver, local optimization techniques such as
hillclimbing and simulated annealing can be used to find particularly
high-scoring boards. The sheer number of possible Boggle boards has
historically prevented an exhaustive search for the global optimum board. We
apply Branch and Bound and a decision diagram-like data structure to perform
the first such search. We find that the highest-scoring boards found via
hillclimbing are, in fact, the global optima.

Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial-robustness of importance-sampling (aka
sensitivity sampling); a useful algorithmic technique that samples elements
with probabilities proportional to some measure of their importance. A
streaming or online algorithm is called adversarially-robust if it succeeds
with high probability on input streams that may change adaptively depending on
previous algorithm outputs. Unfortunately, the dependence between stream
elements breaks the analysis of most randomized algorithms, and in particular
that of importance-sampling algorithms. Previously, Braverman et al. [NeurIPS
2021] suggested that streaming algorithms based on importance-sampling may be
adversarially-robust; however, they proved it only for well-behaved inputs.
  We focus on the adversarial-robustness of online importance-sampling, a
natural variant where sampling decisions are irrevocable and made as data
arrives. Our main technical result shows that, given as input an adaptive
stream of elements $x_1,\ldots,x_T\in \mathbb{R}_+$, online importance-sampling
maintains a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation of their sum while matching (up to
lower order terms) the storage guarantees of the oblivious (non-adaptive) case.
We then apply this result to develop adversarially-robust online algorithms for
two fundamental problems: hypergraph cut sparsification and $\ell_p$ subspace
embedding.

Abstract: We present a randomized linear-space solver for general linear systems
$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ with $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times
n}$ and $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$, without any assumption on the condition
number of $\mathbf{A}$. For matrices whose entries are bounded by
$\mathrm{poly}(n)$, the solver returns a $(1+\epsilon)$-multiplicative
entry-wise approximation to vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Q}^{n}$ using
$\widetilde{O}(n^2 \cdot \mathrm{nnz}(\mathbf{A}))$ bit operations and $O(n
\log n)$ bits of working space (i.e., linear in the size of a vector), where
$\mathrm{nnz}$ denotes the number of nonzero entries. Our solver works for
right-hand vector $\mathbf{b}$ with entries up to $n^{O(n)}$. To our knowledge,
this is the first linear-space linear system solver over the rationals that
runs in $\widetilde{O}(n^2 \cdot \mathrm{nnz}(\mathbf{A}))$ time.
  We also present several applications of our solver to numerical linear
algebra problems, for which we provide algorithms with efficient polynomial
running time and near-linear space. In particular, we present results for
linear regression, linear programming, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and
singular value decomposition.

Motivation: 现有算法处理大权重情况存在不足，需研究动态加权编辑距离问题的解决方案。

Result: 得到动态算法，能在特定时间预处理后以一定时间复杂度维护加权编辑距离，并给出条件下界。

Conclusion: 算法在特定参数范围有细粒度最优性，固定k的选择合理。

Abstract: The edit distance $ed(X,Y)$ of two strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^*$ is the minimum
number of character edits (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to
transform $X$ into $Y$. Its weighted counterpart $ed^w(X,Y)$ minimizes the
total cost of edits, which are specified using a function $w$, normalized so
that each edit costs at least one. The textbook dynamic-programming procedure,
given strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^{\le n}$ and oracle access to $w$, computes
$ed^w(X,Y)$ in $O(n^2)$ time. Nevertheless, one can achieve better running
times if the computed distance, denoted $k$, is small: $O(n+k^2)$ for unit
weights [Landau and Vishkin; JCSS'88] and $\tilde{O}(n+\sqrt{nk^3})$ for
arbitrary weights [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz; FOCS'23].
  In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the weighted edit distance
problem, where the goal is to maintain $ed^w(X,Y)$ for strings $X,Y\in
\Sigma^{\le n}$ that change over time, with each update specified as an edit in
$X$ or $Y$. Very recently, Gorbachev and Kociumaka [STOC'25] showed that the
unweighted distance $ed(X,Y)$ can be maintained in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time per
update after $\tilde{O}(n+k^2)$-time preprocessing; here, $k$ denotes the
current value of $ed(X,Y)$. Their algorithm generalizes to small integer
weights, but the underlying approach is incompatible with large weights.
  Our main result is a dynamic algorithm that maintains $ed^w(X,Y)$ in
$\tilde{O}(k^{3-\gamma})$ time per update after $\tilde{O}(nk^\gamma)$-time
preprocessing. Here, $\gamma\in [0,1]$ is a real trade-off parameter and $k\ge
1$ is an integer threshold fixed at preprocessing time, with $\infty$ returned
whenever $ed^w(X,Y)>k$. We complement our algorithm with conditional lower
bounds showing fine-grained optimality of our trade-off for $\gamma \in
[0.5,1)$ and justifying our choice to fix $k$.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the knapsack problem under explorable uncertainty, we are given a knapsack
instance with uncertain item profits. Instead of having access to the precise
profits, we are only given uncertainty intervals that are guaranteed to contain
the corresponding profits. The actual item profit can be obtained via a query.
The goal of the problem is to adaptively query item profits until the revealed
information suffices to compute an optimal (or approximate) solution to the
underlying knapsack instance. Since queries are costly, the objective is to
minimize the number of queries.
  In the offline variant of this problem, we assume knowledge of the precise
profits and the task is to compute a query set of minimum cardinality that a
third party without access to the profits could use to identify an optimal (or
approximate) knapsack solution. We show that this offline variant is complete
for the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\Sigma_2^p$-complete,
and cannot be approximated within a non-trivial factor unless $\Sigma_2^p =
\Delta_2^p$. Motivated by these strong hardness results, we consider a
resource-augmented variant of the problem where the requirements on the query
set computed by an algorithm are less strict than the requirements on the
optimal solution we compare against. More precisely, a query set computed by
the algorithm must reveal sufficient information to identify an approximate
knapsack solution, while the optimal query set we compare against has to reveal
sufficient information to identify an optimal solution. We show that this
resource-augmented setting allows interesting non-trivial algorithmic results.

### [49] [Faster Algorithm for Bounded Tree Edit Distance in the Low-Distance Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02701)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The tree edit distance is a natural dissimilarity measure between rooted
ordered trees whose nodes are labeled over an alphabet $\Sigma$. It is defined
as the minimum number of node edits (insertions, deletions, and relabelings)
required to transform one tree into the other. In the weighted variant, the
edits have associated costs (depending on the involved node labels) normalized
so that each cost is at least one, and the goal is to minimize the total cost
of edits.
  The unweighted tree edit distance between two trees of total size $n$ can be
computed in $O(n^{2.6857})$ time; in contrast, determining the weighted tree
edit distance is fine-grained equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Paths
problem and requires $n^3/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$ time [Nogler et al.;
STOC'25]. These super-quadratic running times are unattractive for large but
very similar trees, which motivates the bounded version of the problem, where
the runtime is parameterized by the computed distance $k$, potentially yielding
faster algorithms for $k\ll n$.
  Previous best algorithms for the bounded unweighted setting run in
$O(nk^2\log n)$ time [Akmal & Jin; ICALP'21] and $O(n + k^7\log k)$ time [Das
et al.; STOC'23]. For the weighted variant, the only known running time has
been $O(n + k^{15})$.
  We present an $O(n + k^6\log k)$-time algorithm for computing the bounded
tree edit distance in both the weighted and unweighted settings. Our approach
begins with an alternative $O(nk^2\log n)$-time algorithm that handles weights
and is significantly easier to analyze than the existing counterpart. We then
introduce a novel optimization that leverages periodic structures within the
input trees. To utilize it, we modify the $O(k^5)$-size $O(n)$-time universal
kernel, the central component of the prior $O(n + k^{O(1)})$-time algorithms,
so that it produces instances containing these periodic structures.

Motivation: 研究trie树的索引和压缩，高效统计给定字符串模式到达的节点数，分析trie树索引的空间复杂度。

Method: 采用Ferragina等人的XBWT的简洁压缩表示，提出组合问题证明，定义最坏情况熵和k阶经验熵。

Result: 证明trie树的XBWT可在k阶经验熵加o(n)的空间内编码，且在某些情况下trie树的FM - index渐近更小。

Conclusion: 基于BWT的方法在trie树索引和压缩方面有一定优势，在某些情况下优于Prezza提出的r - index。

Abstract: We study the problem of indexing and compressing tries using a BWT-based
approach. Specifically, we consider a succinct and compressed representation of
the XBWT of Ferragina et al.\ [FOCS '05, JACM '09] corresponding to the
analogous of the FM-index [FOCS '00, JACM '05] for tries. This representation
allows to efficiently count the number of nodes reached by a given string
pattern. To analyze the space complexity of the above trie index, we propose a
proof for the combinatorial problem of counting the number of tries with a
given symbol distribution. We use this formula to define a worst-case entropy
measure for tries, as well as a notion of k-th order empirical entropy. In
particular, we show that the relationships between these two entropy measures
are similar to those between the corresponding well-known measures for strings.
We use these measures to prove that the XBWT of a trie can be encoded within a
space bounded by our k-th order empirical entropy plus a o(n) term, with n
being the number of nodes in the trie. Notably, as happens for strings, this
space bound can be reached for every sufficiently small k simultaneously.
Finally, we compare the space complexity of the above index with that of the
r-index for tries proposed by Prezza [SODA '21] and we prove that in some cases
the FM-index for tries is asymptotically smaller.

Conclusion: 对连通k - 中位数问题的重叠和不重叠集群版本有了算法和硬度的相关结论。

Abstract: The connected $k$-median problem is a constrained clustering problem that
combines distance-based $k$-clustering with connectivity information. The
problem allows to input a metric space and an unweighted undirected
connectivity graph that is completely unrelated to the metric space. The goal
is to compute $k$ centers and corresponding clusters such that each cluster
forms a connected subgraph of $G$, and such that the $k$-median cost is
minimized.
  The problem has applications in very different fields like geodesy
(particularly districting), social network analysis (especially community
detection), or bioinformatics. We study a version with overlapping clusters
where points can be part of multiple clusters which is natural for the use case
of community detection. This problem variant is $\Omega(\log n)$-hard to
approximate, and our main result is an $\mathcal{O}(k^2 \log n)$-approximation
algorithm for the problem. We complement it with an
$\Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$-hardness result for the case of disjoint clusters
without overlap with general connectivity graphs, as well as an exact algorithm
in this setting if the connectivity graph is a tree.

Conclusion: 在可复制假设检验算法的样本复杂度研究上取得进展，改进了算法设计，得到多个测试问题的良好结果。

Abstract: A hypothesis testing algorithm is replicable if, when run on two different
samples from the same distribution, it produces the same output with high
probability. This notion, defined by by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorell
[STOC'22], can increase trust in testing procedures and is deeply related to
algorithmic stability, generalization, and privacy. We build general tools to
prove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,
unifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.
  We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable
testing algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening
accuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a
deterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds
against a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in
which the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''
then the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,
resolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower
bounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case
where the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.
  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm
design based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.
Our framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the
non-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct
applications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for
coin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large
parameter regime for uniformity testing.
  We also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,
and, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Result: 证明了在有界的epsilon范围内可以同时保持可用性和一致性。

Conclusion: 通过形式化经济控制有效扩展了经典CAP限制。

Abstract: The CAP theorem asserts a trilemma between consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance. This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and
economically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint
optimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state
machines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior
across adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic
mechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on
convergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that
availability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded
epsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal
economic control.

Abstract: We introduce Team Utility-Constrained Proximal Policy Optimization (TUC-PPO),
a new deep reinforcement learning framework. It extends Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) by integrating team welfare objectives specifically for
spatial public goods games. Unlike conventional approaches where cooperation
emerges indirectly from individual rewards, TUC-PPO instead optimizes a
bi-level objective integrating policy gradients and team utility constraints.
Consequently, all policy updates explicitly incorporate collective payoff
thresholds. The framework preserves PPO's policy gradient core while
incorporating constrained optimization through adaptive Lagrangian multipliers.
Therefore, decentralized agents dynamically balance selfish and cooperative
incentives. The comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance of this
constrained deep reinforcement learning approach compared to unmodified PPO and
evolutionary game theory baselines. It achieves faster convergence to
cooperative equilibria and greater stability against invasion by defectors. The
framework formally integrates team objectives into policy updates. This work
advances multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for social dilemmas while
providing new computational tools for evolutionary game theory research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Result: 在两个基于CRS的数据集上实验，HyFairCRS达到新的最优性能，有效缓解不公平。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS能促进动态交互式对话推荐系统中的多兴趣多样性公平。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

Abstract: Table structure recognition (TSR) and optical character recognition (OCR)
play crucial roles in extracting structured data from tables in scientific
documents. However, existing extraction frameworks built on top of TSR and OCR
methods often fail to quantify the uncertainties of extracted results. To
obtain highly accurate data for scientific domains, all extracted data must be
manually verified, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose
a framework that performs uncertainty-aware data extraction for complex
scientific tables, built on conformal prediction, a model-agnostic method for
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We explored various uncertainty scoring
methods to aggregate the uncertainties introduced by TSR and OCR. We rigorously
evaluated the framework using a standard benchmark and an in-house dataset
consisting of complex scientific tables in six scientific domains. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of using UQ for extraction error detection, and
by manually verifying only 47\% of extraction results, the data quality can be
improved by 30\%. Our work quantitatively demonstrates the role of UQ with the
potential of improving the efficiency in the human-machine cooperation process
to obtain scientifically usable data from complex tables in scientific
documents. All code and data are available on GitHub at

Motivation: 解决现有方法曲率固定和嵌入刚性的问题，实现个性化不确定性建模和几何感知的语义探索。

Method: 将用户、物品和标签表示为自适应曲率的概率球体，使用曲率感知的语义核支持软多跳推理。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，NDCG、校准和多样性优于强基线。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind能在稀疏或抽象领域实现透明、可信和探索驱动的推荐。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

Result: 提出五个跨领域挑战家族，形式化问题、回顾缓解策略并列出开放研究问题。

Conclusion: 为构建强大推荐管道提供蓝图，邀请RecSys社区开发相关工具，为下一代推荐服务奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of
text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external
tools, and co-operate with one another. This perspective paper investigates how
such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of
recommender systems.
  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a
tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii)
captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment,
and communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end
use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline
evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation
generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic
orchestration.
  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity,
scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment
(including covert collusion), and brand compliance.
  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and
outline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda:
a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be
composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the
RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance
tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic
abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the
next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation
services.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Motivation: 现有推荐偏好对齐方法有计算成本高、训练效率低问题，且无尾项推荐解决方案。

Method: 将Bradley - Terry模型从成对比较扩展到列表比较，推导闭式最优策略，提出自适应负采样和重加权策略，理论证明优化LPO损失与最大化最优奖励上界等价。

Result: 在三个公共数据集实验中大幅超越10个基线模型，尾项推荐性能提升达50%，减少17.9% GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec方法能有效解决现有推荐偏好对齐问题，提升尾项推荐性能。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Yuhanleeee/LPO4Rec.

Result: 发现不同分析方法间存在潜在冲突。

Conclusion: 提出解决不同分析方法差异的途径。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

Abstract: The idea of calibrated recommendations is that the properties of the items
that are suggested to users should match the distribution of their individual
past preferences. Calibration techniques are therefore helpful to ensure that
the recommendations provided to a user are not limited to a certain subset of
the user's interests. Over the past few years, we have observed an increasing
number of research works that use calibration for different purposes, including
questions of diversity, biases, and fairness. In this work, we provide a survey
on the recent developments in the area of calibrated recommendations. We both
review existing technical approaches for calibration and provide an overview on
empirical and analytical studies on the effectiveness of calibration for
different use cases. Furthermore, we discuss limitations and common challenges
when implementing calibration in practice.

Result: 即使训练数据有限，模型能加速模拟且保持高精度和优异泛化性，在不同流动系统实验中超越基线模型。

Conclusion: LDSolver在流体流动模拟中达到了先进水平。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Conclusion: 提出的DKGCM图卷积网络结构能有效提升交通需求时空预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Conclusion: 该方法是过程和工具跟踪数据离线异常检测的有效解决方案，且适用于监督和半监督场景。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

Motivation: 现有长视频理解存在挑战，先进的长上下文VLM难以有效利用序列长度，易受无关干扰。

Method: 使用VLM迭代识别和提取视频中最相关的帧用于回答问题。

Result: 在4个不同视频问答数据集上取得SOTA结果，使用3种不同VLM均有提升，长视频表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理时投入更多计算选择最相关上下文可提高准确率。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Result: AIRES在真实图处理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，延迟最多降低至1.8倍。

Conclusion: AIRES能有效加速GCN的外存SpGEMM计算。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GeoAda框架能在不修改原模型架构的情况下，实现灵活且参数高效的微调，保持模型几何一致性。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Motivation: 解决受限文本生成中，目标分布集中在基础模型下低概率输出时，因奖励信号稀疏无信息导致的学习困难问题。

Method: 通过自蒸馏迭代优化基础模型。

Result: 使模型与目标更匹配，显著提升生成质量。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏能有效缓解受限文本生成特定场景下的学习难题，提高生成质量。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

TL;DR: 文章提出Energy - Based Transformers (EBTs)，通过学习验证输入和候选预测兼容性来解决现有System 2 Thinking方法局限，EBTs在训练和推理中表现出色，是有前景的新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有System 2 Thinking方法存在模态特定、问题特定或需额外监督训练等局限，旨在开发仅通过无监督学习学习思考的通用模型。

Method: 训练Energy - Based Transformers (EBTs)，为输入和候选预测对分配能量值，通过基于梯度下降的能量最小化进行预测。

Result: EBTs训练时比Transformer++扩展更快，推理时在语言任务上比Transformer++性能提升29%，图像去噪中优于Diffusion Transformers，在多数下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: EBTs是提升模型学习和思考能力的有前景新范式。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Method: 将训练计算和损失在训练结束时归一化，观察不同模型损失曲线；分析SGD噪声动态模型。

Result: 计算最优训练模型的损失曲线归一化后可塌缩到一条通用曲线，存在超坍缩现象；超坍缩在不同学习率调度、数据集和架构中出现，次优缩放超参数时会失效。

Conclusion: 将坍缩与典型神经缩放定律的幂律结构联系起来，SGD噪声动态模型能准确预测损失曲线并解释超坍缩起源。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Result: 在工业设计上，CROP比现有方法迭代次数少，能取得更好结果，如降低9.9%功耗。

Conclusion: CROP是有效的自动VLSI设计流程调优框架，可提升设计效果。

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

Conclusion: 所提方法能实现准确时空重建，显著降低存储成本。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: 给出了带偏差离线数据的上下文定价的首个紧遗憾保证，技术可应用于随机线性老虎机问题。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

Conclusion: NCPNET能有效解决时态图的共形预测问题，保证覆盖性并提升效率。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect能将不稳定的神经替代模型转化为可靠模拟工具，弥合深度学习计算效率与实际科学应用物理保真度之间的差距。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

Conclusion: VERBA为事后提升机器学习模型的透明度和可比性开辟了新的研究途径。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网约车聚合平台竞争排名机制促使服务提供商采用优惠券策略，设计有效且能适应市场波动的优惠券策略是关键挑战，但现有研究稀缺。

Method: 提出FCA - RL框架，集成FCA和RLA技术；引入RideGym仿真环境用于评估和基准测试定价策略。

Result: 实验显示提出的方法在不同市场条件下始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法对网约车服务提供商补贴优化有效。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励工程方法低效、不一致，现有大语言模型在奖励函数设计中数值优化性能不佳，进化搜索范式资源利用低效，设计周期长、计算开销大。

Method: 提出URDP框架，量化候选奖励函数不确定性，引入不确定性感知贝叶斯优化（UABO），构建双层优化架构，协同大语言模型奖励逻辑推理和贝叶斯优化数值优化能力。

Result: 在3个基准环境35个不同任务的综合评估中，URDP生成的奖励函数质量更高，自动化奖励设计效率显著提升。

Conclusion: URDP在强化学习奖励函数设计方面优于现有方法，能有效解决相关难题。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在APY数据集上的仿真显示，KGZS - SC网络有强大泛化能力，在不同信噪比下对未见类别分类性能显著优于现有框架。

Conclusion: KGZS - SC网络能解决数据驱动语义通信的问题，提升语义通信的泛化性、适应性和效率。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习方法假设数据分布静态，忽略现实中概念漂移对数据的永久改变，需要同时兼顾稳定性和快速适应性。

Method: 引入模拟现实场景的持续学习框架，以Full Relearning为基线，提出Adaptive Memory Realignment方法，对回放缓冲区中的样本进行选择性更新；引入四个概念漂移变体的视觉基准数据集。

Result: AMR在多个基于排练的基线方法实验中，能持续应对概念漂移，以最小开销保持高准确率。

Conclusion: AMR是解决非平稳持续学习环境中稳定性和可塑性问题的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for

Motivation: 临床环境中发现患者风险演变原因对及时干预至关重要，但现有XAI方法无法满足临床时间序列解释任务的独特要求。

Method: 将Shapley值应用于时间序列设置，仅使用实际观察到的特征组合来归因预测变化，还引入新的评估指标。

Result: 在在线患者监测任务实验中，DeltaSHAP在解释质量上提升62%，在MIMIC - III失代偿基准上计算效率提高33%。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP在解释质量和计算效率上优于现有XAI方法，适用于时间敏感的临床应用。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Result: PANI与多种现有离线和离策略强化学习算法兼容，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: PANI方法简单有效，可提升离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Conclusion: 通过偏好优化微调轨迹预测模型，可在复杂交互场景中提升预测性能。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了S2FGL的优越性。

Conclusion: S2FGL框架能有效解决现有联合图学习中存在的问题。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Method: 将问题建模为变分推理优化问题，使用反向传播，在训练中自适应学习每个一元函数可能无限数量的基。

Result: 提出InfinityKAN，将重要超参数纳入学习过程。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN扩展了KAN的潜在适用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Conclusion: GORP可扩大优化空间，保持效率并减轻灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

Method: 为参考SQL查询准备推理步骤并损坏以创建重试数据，用其持续预训练开源编码模型。

Conclusion: 自我纠错可在文本到SQL任务中学习，RetrySQL为提升SQL语言模型生成准确率提供新方法。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LN在推理时的作用不明且阻碍模型机制可解释性

Method: 从GPT - 2模型移除所有LN层，测试不同规模模型移除LN层所需微调数据，在LN - free模型上测试可解释性技术

Result: 移除LN层仅使验证损失小幅增加；移除LN层所需微调数据随模型参数次线性增长；直接logit归因能给出组件确切直接影响，归因修补准确性无显著提升；GPT - 2的“置信神经元”在LN - free模型中不活跃

Conclusion: LN在语言建模中并非起重要作用，GPT - 2类模型可在无LN层下运行，LN - free模型有助于更精确的可解释性研究

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升DBNs在输入宽度增加时的扩展性，同时进一步减小模型大小。

Method: 采用可训练、可微互连结构；提出基于SAT的逻辑等价剪枝和基于相似度的数据驱动剪枝。

Result: 使DBNs能扩展到更宽的层，且剪枝方法在压缩率 - 准确率权衡上表现更好。

Conclusion: 扩展的DBNs能在提升扩展性的同时减小模型大小，且剪枝方法有效。

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

Motivation: 扩散模型推理计算成本高阻碍其作为快速物理模拟器，研究能否将图像视频生成中的潜在空间策略用于动力系统仿真及成本。

Method: 研究将潜在空间生成策略应用于动力系统仿真。

Result: 潜在空间仿真精度对宽范围压缩率（达1000倍）有惊人鲁棒性；基于扩散的模拟器比非生成模型更准确，且能以更多样性补偿预测不确定性。

Conclusion: 给出训练潜在空间模拟器从架构到优化器等关键实际设计选择。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

TL;DR: 提出可学习的L - VAE模型，学习损失函数超参数以平衡解纠缠和重构损失，实验表明其表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解η - VAE需要经验调整超参数的局限性，更好地平衡解纠缠和重构损失。

Method: 提出L - VAE模型，同时学习损失项权重和模型架构参数，在损失函数中添加正则化项。

Result: L - VAE在多个数据集上，通过解纠缠指标衡量表现最佳或第二好，在CelebA数据集上成功解纠缠面部属性。

Conclusion: L - VAE能有效平衡重构保真度和解纠缠潜在维度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer的matVAE模型评估蛋白质变体功能影响，在DMS数据集上有表现，显示DMS数据集替代MSAs潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSAs的变体效应预测器假设自然发生变体是合适的，在药物基因组学中受挑战，DMS数据集可提供替代方案。

Method: 提出带结构化先验的transformer-based matVAE模型，在33个DMS数据集上评估，比较matVAE - MSA与DeepSequence、matENC - DMS性能，还将AlphaFold生成结构融入模型。

Result: matVAE - MSA在零样本预测上优于DeepSequence，matENC - DMS在监督预测任务表现更好，融入结构后模型性能提升。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有潜力在不显著损失预测性能情况下替代MSAs，应进一步开发DMS数据集及探索其关系以提升变体效应预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

TL;DR: 现有电子病历数据存在质量问题，本文提出医疗数据啄取方法，通过工具评估数据集效果良好，能结合外部知识改进结果有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子病历数据用于流行病学研究和人工智能训练时，现有质量评估方法不足，缺乏系统程序评估数据是否适合研究。

Method: 提出医疗数据啄取方法，利用软件工程的单元测试和覆盖概念，借助医疗数据啄取工具（MDPT），包含自动测试生成器和数据测试框架。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估MDPT，每个队列生成55 - 73个测试，正确识别20 - 43个数据问题，并对测试套件进行详细分析。

Conclusion: 该方法结合外部医学知识进行上下文敏感的数据质量测试，从质量保证角度应对挑战，为进一步发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Conclusion: 此架构可能支撑下一代能自主生成新任务及解决方案的神经网络，推动机器学习迈向通用人工智能。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Result: PTS - BE在多种稀疏奖励和纯探索任务的环境中显著优于其他基线。

Conclusion: 基于认知不确定性的探索奖励有理论优势，PTS - BE框架能实现样本高效的深度探索。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Method: 基于后门调整控制混杂因素，提出DAID框架，包含人口统计感知的数据重平衡和人口统计无关的特征聚合。

Result: 在三个跨领域基准测试中，DAID在公平性和泛化性上始终优于多个现有检测器。

Conclusion: 验证了DAID框架的理论基础和实际有效性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Motivation: 在线部署中草稿模型与目标模型不兼容及期望提升延迟，需解决挑战并实现‘一个草稿模型适配所有目标模型’。

Method: 引入在线n - gram缓存和混合蒸馏微调解决词汇不匹配，利用自适应草稿技术提高解码速度。

Result: OmniDraft使Llama - 68M与多种目标模型配对进行推测解码，有1.5 - 2倍速度提升。

Conclusion: OmniDraft适合设备端大语言模型应用，解决了在线部署挑战。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Result: 无约束采样能重现自然库和获批疗法特征，SVDD引导下可开发性分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架结合高通量检测可形成迭代、ML驱动的抗体设计流程。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像应用受数据稀缺和隐私法规限制，联邦学习有高通信成本且任务单一的问题。

Method: 采用基础模型提取紧凑信息嵌入，客户协作训练差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP - CVAE）来建模全局隐私感知数据分布。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能增强隐私性、可扩展性和效率，支持多样化下游任务。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

Motivation: 传统ERP系统的静态规则方法忽视市场参与者战略互动，现有强化学习定价多为单智能体，未建模供应链相互依赖关系。

Method: 在模拟环境中，基于真实电商交易数据和LightGBM需求预测模型，评估MADDPG、MADQN和QMIX三种MARL算法，与静态规则基线对比。

Result: 规则代理公平性和价格稳定性高，但缺乏竞争动态；MADQN定价激进，公平性低；MADDPG更平衡，支持市场竞争，公平性较高且定价稳定。

Conclusion: MARL引入了静态定价规则未捕捉的战略行为，可为动态定价未来发展提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Conclusion: 基于共识的协议可避免无用数据传输，提出的新协议和算法在联邦学习中有较好效果。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习连续控制方法存在首因偏差，影响样本效率和泛化性，而人类因婴儿期遗忘现象较少受此影响，以此为灵感提出新算法。

Method: 提出FoG算法，包含Experience Replay Decay（平衡记忆，减少早期经验影响）和Network Expansion（动态增加新参数，增强利用数据模式能力）两个机制。

Result: 在四个主要连续控制基准测试、超40个任务中，FoG算法表现优于BRO、SimBa和TD - MPC2等现有深度强化学习算法。

Conclusion: FoG算法在连续控制的深度强化学习中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Method: 引入集成空间、时间和网络依赖的框架进行微出行需求预测。

Result: 框架相比基线模型将需求预测准确性提高了27%至49%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效捕捉微出行需求模式，支持数据驱动的微出行管理，实现优化车队分配、降低成本和可持续城市规划。

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Result: 在基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，优于现有方法，在低数据情况下表现稳健，具有零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了跨物种PPI预测，为多物种数据稀疏或不平衡场景下的相互作用预测提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律假设数据无限且主要适用于计算受限场景，现代大语言模型对大规模互联网数据集依赖增加，计算受限假设不再适用，需要重视token效率的架构。

Method: 研究使用2 - 单纯形Transformer架构，通过高效Triton内核实现将标准点积注意力推广到三线性函数。

Result: 2 - 单纯形Transformer比标准Transformer有更好的token效率，相同大小模型在数学、编码、推理和逻辑任务上表现更优，且改变了知识和推理任务缩放定律的指数。

Conclusion: 2 - 单纯形Transformer架构能提高token效率，在相关任务上有更好表现。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Motivation: 循环模型虽理论上可处理长序列，但在训练上下文长度外性能下降，无法实现长度泛化。

Method: 对未探索状态假设进行实证和理论分析，采用如用高斯噪声初始化状态等简单训练干预方法。

Result: 仅500个训练后步骤，就能让模型对远长于训练上下文的序列实现长度泛化，在长上下文任务中性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是一种简单高效的方式，能让通用循环模型实现稳健的长度泛化。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Motivation: 现有生存模型通常仅在总体层面校准，存在少数子群体校准不佳风险，可能导致错误临床决策。

Method: 将多校准构建为约束优化问题，在训练中同时优化校准和区分度，数学证明优化方法能高概率得到近似最优且可行的解。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上与现有基线方法的实证比较，证明了GRADUATE的有效性。

Conclusion: GRADUATE能解决现有生存模型校准问题，具有较好效果。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the

for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO式方法依赖模型初始生成正样本能力，在早期训练和困难推理任务中难以让模型解决初始失败的问题，需探索新推理轨迹。

Method: 提出Self - Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)框架，通过基于真实答案生成样本，使模型有效探索并产生更符合自身策略的推理轨迹。

Result: ExPO提高了推理基准的学习效率和最终性能，在如MATH level - 5等困难场景中超越基于专家示范的方法。

Conclusion: ExPO框架在解决模型推理能力方面有良好效果，能在困难场景中取得更好表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Result: 通过一系列实验证明框架在实际应用中有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的考虑推理时文本混淆的框架可有效用于治疗效果估计。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is

Conclusion: 探讨了增强学习过程和拓宽QD算法在动态组合优化挑战中适用性的未来研究方向。

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same

across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional

fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex

visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Result: 在五个代表性MOEAs和基准套件上实验，证明方法能有效估计运行时间上限。

Conclusion: 该工作为数值优化中MOEAs的理论研究提供实用补充。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

Conclusion: 多增益模型是分析组合优化问题中(μ+λ)进化算法运行时间的有效工具。

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and
unpreparedness. Based on our findings, we provide implications for stakeholders
to enhance tech interview preparation for candidates pursuing software
engineering roles.

TL;DR: 提出用自然语言进行代码结构搜索的方法，结合LLM和结构搜索工具，对两种DSL实例化，评估显示该方法有效且优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构代码搜索工具使用特定领域语言（DSL），难学习和编写，需降低搜索门槛。

Method: 结合LLM解读自然语言查询的能力与结构搜索工具，对Semgrep和GQL两种DSL实例化，构建新基准评估。

Result: 该方法有效且稳健，精确率和召回率在55% - 70%，F1分数显著优于语义代码搜索和LLM检索基线。

Conclusion: 用自然语言进行结构代码搜索的方法可行且效果好。

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

TL;DR: 研究探讨内部软件指标能否预测移动应用程序的受欢迎程度，发现将问题转为二元分类时结果显著改善，内部代码指标可作为应用受欢迎程度的有用指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测移动应用发布前的受欢迎程度能为开发者带来竞争优势，但这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因此探索内部软件指标能否用于预测应用受欢迎程度。

Method: 使用F - Droid的446个开源安卓应用数据集，提取多种特征，收集谷歌应用商店的额外信息，对回归和分类模型在三种特征集上进行评估。

Result: 回归模型因数据偏斜表现不佳，转为二元分类（受欢迎与不受欢迎）后结果显著改善，最佳模型（使用投票集的多层感知器）F1分数达0.72。

Conclusion: 内部代码指标虽解释力有限，但可作为应用受欢迎程度的有用指标，挑战了早期否定内部指标可预测软件质量的观点。

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of
software quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自我报告工具评估人类因素有潜在偏差，促使研究结合客观方法，本研究旨在比较心理压力测量和生物特征指标，识别软件工程任务中生物数据压力模式。

Method: 进行实验，参与者完成预调查，佩戴生物传感器完成两个编程任务，每次任务后回答简短调查，最后进行简短离职访谈。

Result: 心理测量工具未发现压力，访谈中参与者有不同感受，生物特征仅EDA相位峰值有显著差异。

Conclusion: 所选通过严格时间限制诱导压力的方式不足，为未来相关研究提供方法见解。

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

Motivation: 软件开发依赖文本通信，现有情感分析工具在不同平台数据集上表现不一致，需改进工具选择。

Method: 分析10个来自5个平台的开发者通信数据集的语言和统计特征，评估14个情感分析工具性能，提出映射方法和问卷。

Result: 数据集特征可用于改进工具选择，基于transformer的模型表现较好，但工具效果依赖上下文。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于软件工程中情感分析工具的选择，且随着通信上下文演变需持续评估。

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

TL;DR: 针对维护COBOL代码库难题，提出多智能体方法生成代码解释，经评估效果优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COBOL代码因年代、复杂性和开发者减少，维护困难，且现有研究因COBOL特性存在局限。

Method: 提出多智能体方法，利用两个基于大语言模型的智能体协作，结合代码库上下文信息生成解释。

Result: 在函数代码解释上显著优于基线；在文件层面能解释超窗口大小文件，表现更好；在项目层面能解释82%项目的功能和目的。

Conclusion: 所提出的多智能体方法在COBOL代码解释上效果良好，能有效应对相关挑战。

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

Motivation: 现有纵向联邦学习（VFL）工作缺乏审核数据方推理软件执行正确性的机制。

Method: 设计VeFIA框架，任务方利用带可信执行环境（TEE）的框架和协调器的推理结果验证数据方计算结果的正确性。

Result: 只要异常推理超过5.4%，任务方以99.99%的概率检测到推理软件执行异常，无额外在线推理延迟；随机采样验证在检测异常推理时的阳性预测值、阴性预测值和真阳性率达100%。

Conclusion: 这是首篇讨论VFL中推理软件执行正确性的论文，VeFIA框架有效可行。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

Motivation: 现有静态分析工具检测Python类型错误时假阳性率高，单元测试生成技术缺有效引导，影响软件可靠性和开发者效率。

Method: RTED结合逐步类型约束分析与反射验证来引导测试生成过程，抑制假阳性。

Result: 在两个基准测试中比四个现有技术多检测22 - 29个类型错误，假阳性更少，精度提升173.9% - 245.9%，还在六个开源项目中发现12个未知类型错误。

Conclusion: RTED是一种有效检测Python类型错误的技术，能提升检测准确性。

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型公平性测试方法依赖特定资源、难以扩展，需新的自动化方法。

Method: 采用元形态测试，通过输入提示的受控修改发现偏差；利用大语言模型进行测试用例生成和输出评估；开发三个开源工具支持测试。

Result: Meta - Fair平均精度达92%，29%执行显示有偏差行为；大语言模型评估可靠，最佳F1分数达0.79；可通过设计缓解非确定性影响。

Conclusion: 虽有挑战，但该方法为大语言模型测试自动化提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

Method: 探索零样本提示和最少到最多提示两种方法优化LLMREI，在33次模拟利益相关者访谈中评估其性能，放弃微调方法。

Result: LLMREI与人类访谈者犯错误数量相近，能提取大部分需求，有生成高度上下文相关问题的能力。

Conclusion: LLMREI在大量利益相关者访谈自动化方面有最大优势。

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

Conclusion: RLHGNN是一种适用于实时业务流程监控应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

Result: 使用标志分类为与可持续性相关的帖子比对照组少，有适度更高的确定性和显著提高的性能，且被认为比仅依靠定义更有用和易懂。

Conclusion: 可持续性标志在识别云架构帖子中的可持续性方面是有效的。

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

### [149] [FinAI-BERT: A Transformer-Based Model for Sentence-Level Detection of AI Disclosures in Financial Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01991)
*Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: 研究引入FinAI - BERT模型对金融文本中AI相关内容进行句子级分类，表现出色且稳定，有理论和实践价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测AI相关披露的方法在粒度、可解释性和鲁棒性上不足，需更好的工具。

Method: 引入FinAI - BERT模型，在手动整理的1586个句子数据集上微调。

Result: FinAI - BERT分类性能近乎完美，优于传统基线模型，且通过SHAP确保可解释性，经检验模型稳定。

Conclusion: 理论上推动金融NLP发展，实践上为相关人员提供可扩展、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

Result: 在实际投资组合优化矩阵上的评估表明，该强化学习框架可调整预条件，显著加速收敛并降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的加速求解器支持动态投资组合分配和实时期权定价中的更快决策。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

Result: 框架能捕捉复杂非线性依赖关系，支持通过风险价值和预期损失进行风险估计。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可提高金融压力测试的灵活性、鲁棒性和真实性。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve
the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing.

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

Motivation: 研究如何利用头条新闻数据来预测SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust（SPY）的股票价格。

Method: 使用《华尔街日报》新闻头条，通过OpenAI文本嵌入模型生成向量编码，用PCA提取关键特征；收集金融经济数据；训练超390个机器学习推理模型。

Result: 头条数据嵌入使股票价格预测相比无该嵌入的机器学习系统至少提升40%。

Conclusion: 头条数据嵌入对股票价格预测有显著益处。

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

Motivation: 传统支撑阻力位识别方法难适应现代市场，现有机器学习方法多聚焦价格预测而非结构水平识别。

Method: 采用多头注意力机制分析空间相关性和市场微观结构关系，结合先进特征工程构建动态相关矩阵，用基于注意力的自动编码器进行表征学习，通过DBSCAN无监督聚类提取支撑位。

Result: 在标准普尔500指数成分股上评估，DeepSupp在六项金融指标上超越六个基线方法，表现达到当前最优。

Conclusion: DeepSupp解决了支撑阻力位检测的关键差距，证明基于注意力的架构有助于发现市场模式、改进交易策略。

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Abstract: Portfolio allocation via stock price prediction is inherently difficult due
to the notoriously low signal-to-noise ratio of stock time series. This paper
proposes a method by integrating wavelet transform convolution and channel
attention with LSTM to implement stock price prediction based portfolio
allocation. Stock time series data first are processed by wavelet transform
convolution to reduce the noise. Processed features are then reconstructed by
channel attention. LSTM is utilized to predict the stock price using the final
processed features. We construct a portfolio consists of four stocks with
trading signals predicted by model. Experiments are conducted by evaluating the
return, Sharpe ratio and max drawdown performance. The results indicate that
our method achieves robust performance even during period of post-pandemic
downward market.

error patterns, sector-specific performance, and future directions for
improving interpretability and generalization.

Conclusion: SAGE - FIN能基于弱标签或无标签数据标记欺诈项目，满足监管要求的可解释性。

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

Motivation: 加密货币市场有投资机会但风险高，需考察领先加密货币的尾行为。

Method: 使用先前研究的七参数估计，运用广义缓和稳定（GTS）分布，绘制正态分布的分位数 - 分位数（Q - Q）图。

Result: 比特币和以太坊都呈现重尾收益分布，以太坊极端值出现频率比按比特币模型预期的更高。

Conclusion: 以太坊的尾风险比比特币更显著。

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market presents both significant investment opportunities
and higher risks relative to traditional financial assets. This study examines
the tail behavior of daily returns for two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin
and Ethereum, using seven-parameter estimates from prior research, which
applied the Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution. Quantile-quantile
(Q-Q) plots against the Normal distribution reveal that both assets exhibit
heavy-tailed return distributions. However, Ethereum consistently shows a
greater frequency of extreme values than would be expected under its
Bitcoin-modeled counterpart, indicating more pronounced tail risk.

Conclusion: 该框架为检测复杂金融系统的潜在转变和风险建模提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding the stochastic behavior of currency exchange rates is critical
for assessing financial stability and anticipating market transitions. In this
study, we investigate the empirical dynamics of the USD exchange rate in three
economies, including Iran, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, through the lens of the
Kramers-Moyal expansion and Fokker-Planck formalism. Using log-return data, we
confirm the Markovian nature of the exchange rate fluctuations, enabling us to
model the system with a second-order Fokker-Planck equation. The inferred
Langevin coefficients reveal a stabilizing linear drift and a nonlinear,
return-dependent diffusion term, reflecting both regulatory effects and
underlying volatility. A rolling-window estimation of these coefficients,
paired with structural breakpoint detection, uncovers regime shifts that align
with major political and economic events, offering insight into the hidden
dynamics of currency instability. This framework provides a robust foundation
for detecting latent transitions and modeling risk in complex financial
systems.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Conclusion: 高表现模因币中操纵现象普遍，其大幅收益可能是人为操纵而非自然市场动态所致。

Abstract: From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one
of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused
crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins derive value primarily from
community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study
presents a cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988
tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize the
tokenomics of meme coins and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal
analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (>100%), an alarming 82.6%
show evidence of extensive use of artificial growth strategies designed to
create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading
and a form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation
(LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We
also find evidence of schemes designed to profit at the expense of investors,
such as pump and dumps and rug pulls. In particular, most of the tokens
involved had previously experienced wash trading or LPI, indicating how initial
manipulations often set the stage for later exploitation. These findings reveal
that manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins and suggest
that their dramatic gains are often likely driven by coordinated efforts rather
than natural market dynamics.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

Conclusion: 理论成果得到合成数据和计算金融随机模拟问题数值研究的支持。

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem
in computational finance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the

TL;DR: 本文研究结构无关因果推断，发现估计治疗效果取决于治疗噪声分布，分析了双机器学习估计器在不同噪声下的表现，提出ACE程序，给出二元治疗的极小极大保证，并通过实验验证高阶鲁棒估计器的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在给定干扰函数的黑盒机器学习估计时，如何更好地估计治疗效果，以及其与治疗噪声分布的关系。

Method: 聚焦部分线性模型，分析双机器学习（DML）估计器在高斯和非高斯治疗噪声下的情况，构造新的ACE程序，给出二元治疗的极小极大保证，进行合成需求估计实验。

Result: DML估计器对高斯治疗噪声是极小极大率最优的，对独立非高斯治疗噪声是次优的；ACE程序在治疗噪声的(r + 1)阶累积量非零时，对干扰误差有r阶不敏感性；实验证明高阶鲁棒估计器有实际益处。

Conclusion: 治疗效果的估计与治疗噪声分布有关，新的ACE程序和高阶鲁棒估计器在非高斯噪声下有更好的表现。

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Motivation: 改进基于诱导点的稀疏变分高斯过程，提升其性能。

Method: 采用块对角结构扩展缩放矩阵，基于Power EP重新审视稀疏GP统一框架。

Result: 块对角近似在保持计算成本相当的情况下，表现与或优于现有对角近似；新PEP框架在不同超参数设置下有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为标准变分方法提供了灵活替代方案。

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

TL;DR: 研究通过多尺度有限元心脏建模框架MyoFE研究HCM诱导的细胞异常对纤维紊乱的影响，发现异质细胞水平异常会导致纤维紊乱，心外膜附近紊乱更明显，且重塑左心室心脏性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化纤维紊乱对理解肥厚型心肌病（HCM）复杂病理生理学至关重要，研究HCM诱导的细胞异常在纤维紊乱发展中的作用及其对心脏泵血功能的影响。

Method: 使用基于应力的定律在多尺度有限元心脏建模框架MyoFE中重新定向肌纤维和胶原蛋白以预测纤维紊乱，量化不同细胞异常分布对纤维紊乱发展的影响。

Result: 异质细胞水平异常破坏心肌正常力学导致纤维紊乱，紊乱模式因扰动而异，心外膜附近纤维紊乱更明显，重塑左心室心脏性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究为HCM的结构和功能后果提供重要见解，为靶向心脏重塑的治疗干预研究提供框架。

Abstract: A significant hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is fiber
disarray, which is associated with various cardiac events such as heart
failure. Quantifying fiber disarray remains critical for understanding the
disease s complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of
heterogeneous HCM-induced cellular abnormalities in the development of fiber
disarray and their subsequent impact on cardiac pumping function. Fiber
disarray is predicted using a stress-based law to reorient myofibers and
collagen within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework, MyoFE.
Specifically, the model is used to quantify the distinct impacts of
heterogeneous distributions of hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and
fibrosis on fiber disarray development and examines their effect on functional
characteristics of the heart. Our results show that heterogenous cell level
abnormalities highly disrupt the normal mechanics of myocardium and lead to
significant fiber disarray. The pattern of disarray varies depending on the
specific perturbation, offering valuable insights into the progression of HCM.
Despite the random distribution of perturbed regions within the cardiac muscle,
significantly higher fiber disarray is observed near the epicardium compared to
the endocardium across all perturbed left ventricle (LV) models. This regional
difference in fiber disarray, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns
with previous DT-MRI studies, highlighting the role of regional myocardial
mechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, cardiac
performance declined in the remodeled LVs, particularly in those with fibrosis
and hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the
structural and functional consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future
investigations into therapeutic interventions targeting cardiac remodeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别‘真正’绿色专利，研究其与企业财务指标的关系，为政策制定提供依据。

Method: 对约1240万曾被归类为绿色的专利进行训练，用简单神经网络扩大基线词典；控制反向因果关系研究专利与企业财务指标的关系。

Result: ‘真正’绿色专利约占之前文献归类绿色专利总数的20%，引用率低1%；持有‘真正’绿色专利能提高企业销售、市场份额和生产力，高新颖性的还能带来更高利润。

Conclusion: 使用文本分析进行更精细的专利分类对不同领域政策制定很重要。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Motivation: 分析绿色氨作为绿色能源供应链战略中介的成本效益路径，评估其与其他氢载体的竞争力。

Method: 对绿色氨供应链进行技术经济分析，比较不同路径和氢载体。

Result: 气态氢是欧洲最经济的进口选择，氨相对液氢成本优势缩小；摩洛哥等国因低可再生能源成本有竞争力；不同运输方式适用于不同需求和距离；2040年氨主要用于直接应用。

Conclusion: 政策制定者应优先发展氢气管道基础设施，谨慎投资氨的中短期基础设施优势，减少长期对氨作为氢载体的依赖。

Abstract: Green ammonia is emerging as a strategic intermediary within green energy
supply chains, serving effectively as both an industrial commodity and hydrogen
carrier. This study provides a techno-economic analysis of green ammonia supply
chains, comparing cost-effective pathways from global production to European
consumers, and evaluates ammonia alongside alternative hydrogen carriers.
Gaseous hydrogen consistently remains the most economical import option for
Europe, though ammonia holds a narrowing cost advantage over liquid hydrogen
(from 16 % in 2030 to 10 % by 2040). Competitive ammonia suppliers, notably
Morocco, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, benefit from low
renewable energy costs, with significant price reductions expected by 2040,
driven by falling costs for electricity, electrolysers, and conversion
technologies. Optimal transport modes vary by consumer demand and distance:
trucks are ideal for low demands at all distances, rail for medium ranges, and
pipelines for high-demand scenarios. By 2040, ammonia will primarily serve
direct-use applications, as hydrogen consumers increasingly shift to direct
hydrogen supplies. Policymakers should prioritize pipeline infrastructure for
hydrogen distribution, cautiously invest in ammonia's short- to medium-term
infrastructure advantages, and limit long-term reliance on ammonia as a
hydrogen carrier to mitigate stranded asset risks.

Conclusion: 新的BRUI能帮助英国政策制定者衡量和理解脱欧相关不确定性，有助于制定更有效的政策。

Abstract: Important game-changer economic events and transformations cause
uncertainties that may affect investment decisions, capital flows,
international trade, and macroeconomic variables. One such major transformation
is Brexit, which refers to the multiyear process through which the UK withdrew
from the EU. This study develops and uses a new Brexit-Related Uncertainty
Index (BRUI). In creating this index, we apply Text Mining, Context Window,
Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Deep
Learning techniques to analyse the monthly country reports of the Economist
Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to January 2025. Additionally, we employ a
standard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied
responses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing
the BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index
(CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events.
Empirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed
uncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index
can assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of
Brexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation.

Method: 在实地实验室对超390名青少年进行实验，随机分配到共同身份、多元文化身份或中性身份启动条件，玩公共品博弈游戏。

Result: 基线时移民比本地人合作度高13%，激活本地人多元文化身份后合作度提高约3个百分点，缩小与移民差距。

Conclusion: 激活本地人多元文化身份有助于促进移民与本地青少年的合作，缩小合作差距。

Abstract: Immigration has shaped many nations, posing the challenge of integrating
immigrants into society. While economists often focus on immigrants' economic
outcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and
health) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial.
These interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable
contracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient
outcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder
cooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on
fostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming
different identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native
youth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin
and connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by
making salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society),
Multicultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a
lab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were
randomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good
Game. Results show that immigrants are 13 percent more cooperative than natives
at baseline. Natives increase cooperation by about 3 percentage points when
their multicultural identity is primed, closing the initial gap with immigrant
peers.

Result: 仅提供满足助学金学业要求的教育回报信息有积极影响，使获得学分增加约3个，辍学概率降低约4个百分点，结果受该处理引发的抱负提升调节。

Conclusion: 提供特定教育回报信息能改善学生学业表现和降低辍学率。

Abstract: Understanding the role of information among disadvantaged students is crucial
in explaining their investment decisions in higher education. Indeed,
information barriers on the returns and the gains from completing college may
explain a substantial share of variation in students' degree completion. We
conduct a field experiment with 7,806 university students in Italy who benefit
from financial aid assistance, by providing information, either on the labor
market returns of completing college or on the education returns of meeting the
academic requirements attached to the financial aid. Our results suggest that
only the latter information treatment has a positive effect on academic
performance, increasing the number of credits obtained by around 3, and by
decreasing the probability of dropout by around 4 percentage points. We also
find that the results are mediated by an aspiration lift generated by our
treatment.

Result: NSBI方法实现接近理论最优的灵敏度，给出大型强子对撞机高亮度升级的预期约束。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，除希格斯三线性自耦合外，还能考虑对影响脱壳希格斯产生的其他SMEFT算子的约束。

Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the
experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts
have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in
proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as
a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural
simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the
Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective
field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference
effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced
techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also
incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for
effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves
sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints
for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we
primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider
constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.

Conclusion: 指出人类和大语言模型驱动评估的性能差异，为合成启发式评估设计提供参考。

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

Conclusion: 对话中的情感建模不仅要在表达情感上结构对齐，还需有定性深度，开发情感智能代理要结合自动和以人为本的方法。

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

Conclusion: 提出未来人机交互、计算机支持的协同工作和机器学习研究在支持目标变量构建方面的机会。

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Motivation: 现有动态规划算法的剪枝策略PELT和FPOP分别在稀疏变化场景和多参数设置中有局限性，需更好方法。

Method: 引入DUal Simple Test (DUST)框架，通过评估对偶函数与阈值来剪枝候选点。

Result: DUST在不同变化点机制和模型中有效，在单参数模型兼具PELT简单性和FPOP高效性，对非高斯模型有利。

Conclusion: DUST框架灵活且广泛适用，能有效恢复最优变化点结构，尤其适用于非高斯模型。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of detecting multiple change points in large time
series by optimising a penalised likelihood derived from exponential family
models. While dynamic programming algorithms can solve this task exactly with
at most quadratic time complexity, recent years have seen the development of
pruning strategies to improve their time efficiency. However, the two existing
approaches have notable limitations: PELT struggles with pruning efficiency in
sparse-change scenarios, while FPOP's structure is ill-suited for
multi-parametric settings. To address these issues, we introduce the DUal
Simple Test (DUST) framework, which prunes candidates by evaluating a dual
function against a threshold. This approach is highly flexible and broadly
applicable to parametric models of any dimension. Under mild assumptions, we
establish strong duality for the underlying non-convex pruning problem. We
demonstrate DUST's effectiveness across various change point regimes and
models. In particular, for one-parametric models, DUST matches the simplicity
of PELT with the efficiency of FPOP. Its use is especially advantageous for
non-Gaussian models. Its use is especially advantageous for non-Gaussian
models. Finally, we apply DUST to mouse monitoring time series under a
change-in-variance model, illustrating its ability to recover the optimal
change point structure efficiently.

Result: 提出了一个包含HLV的主动学习概念框架，探讨了大语言模型作为标注器的可能性。

Conclusion: 为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了概念基础，能更好反映现实标注的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

Motivation: 标准解码器架构思维链推理以自然语言外化，效率低，探究Huginn - 3.5B中是否出现潜在思维链推理结构。

Method: 使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等探测技术，在算术任务上检查模型内部行为。

Result: 追踪最终和中间结果标记的秩轨迹，可解释的潜在思维链证据有限；递归块间探测存在显著不一致；增加递归深度收益甚微。

Conclusion: Huginn - 3.5B模型在潜在思维链推理方面效果不佳，不如显式外化推理步骤的模型。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

Method: 端到端优化长文本任务，引入MemAgent工作流，按段读取文本并使用覆盖策略更新内存，扩展DAPO算法进行训练。

Result: MemAgent能从32K文本训练的8K上下文扩展到3.5M QA任务，性能损失<5%，在512K RULER测试中达95%+。

Conclusion: MemAgent具有出色的长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续DAP方法存在计算成本高、对增量数据顺序敏感、为所有最终任务提供单一通用模型等局限。

Method: 利用LoRA模块这一参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，实现高效并行的领域自适应预训练。

Result: 实现了高效且对领域顺序鲁棒的预训练，能为特定任务提供定制化预训练模型，方法可扩展到标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX能有效解决现有持续DAP方法的问题，具有良好扩展性。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著超越所有开源代理，达到专有代理的性能。

Conclusion: WebSailor方法能有效赋予模型在复杂信息环境中减少不确定性的能力，缩小开源模型与专有模型的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Result: 能使大语言模型情感分布与反事实基线和HR基线对齐，实现小KL散度、减少校准误差并能泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF是一种可扩展且可解释的对齐和偏差减轻方法，与已部署模型兼容，无需大量提示工程或微调。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Motivation: 现有自动语音识别研究很少评估模型在不同语音语境中的泛化能力，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用四个阿坎语语音语料库对基于transformer架构的七种阿坎语自动语音识别模型进行基准测试。

Result: 模型存在领域依赖，在训练领域外准确率下降；Whisper和Wav2Vec2架构有不同错误行为。

Conclusion: 低资源语言应用架构选择需考虑ASR错误的可读性和透明度权衡，需要针对性的领域自适应技术、自适应路由策略和多语言训练框架。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在错误和探索无成效推理路径问题，自纠错能力重要，但模型存在自纠错盲点，需系统研究该现象。

Method: 引入Self - Correction Bench框架，在三个复杂度级别进行可控错误注入，测试14个模型。

Result: 平均盲点率64.5%，盲点与训练数据组成有关，追加‘Wait’可使盲点减少89.3%。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型存在关键局限性，研究为提升其可靠性和可信度提供了潜在途径。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

Motivation: 在大语言模型实际应用中，选择合适模型需平衡性能和运营成本，推理能力模型使不同模式成本差距增大，需优化查询处理。

Method: 提出基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，将输入查询智能分配到思考或非思考模式。

Result: 在多个医疗数据集实验表明，SynapseRoute比单一思考模式提升整体准确率，减少推理时间36.8%和令牌消耗39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由可优化准确性、成本效益和用户体验，避免过度推理问题，引入的AIT指数可综合评估准确性、延迟和令牌成本的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Method: 提出MOTIF，一种基于强化学习微调的多轮生成思考令牌的训练方法，并在GSM8K数据集上对Qwen2.5 - 3B - Instruct模型进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中比普通GRPO训练分别提升3.8%和3.3%，且仅用15%的样本。

Conclusion: MOTIF方法有效，能突破上下文大小限制，且具有样本效率，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code

Method: 提出答案匹配的生成式评估方法，让模型生成自由形式答案，用现代语言模型判断答案是否匹配参考答案；对MMLU - Pro和GPQA - Diamond进行标注获取人工评分数据，衡量不同评估方法的一致性。

Result: 答案匹配方法即使使用小模型也能与人工评分近乎完美一致，而选择题评估和无参考答案的大语言模型评判与人工评分一致性差，且答案匹配会显著改变部分模型排名。

Conclusion: 应将评估生态从选择题评估转向答案匹配评估。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Conclusion: 揭示了语言模型偏好调整的新特性和基于用户反馈训练模型的新攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

Result: 在先前确定性替代模型无法处理的区域达到了最先进的精度，在不同雷诺数下能高精度重建速度和磁场的全谱能量分布等。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能有效模拟不同雷诺数下二维不可压缩电阻磁流体动力学湍流的时空演化，尤其在极端湍流水平下仍有出色表现。

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

TL;DR: 提出使用粒子滤波器的低复杂度跟踪算法结合时间反馈进行语音增强，在合成数据集和真实录音测试中表现良好。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景需资源密集型跟踪算法，额外计算开销阻碍其在资源受限场景应用，如实时语音增强。

Method: 采用粒子滤波器形式的低复杂度跟踪算法，引入时间反馈，利用空间选择性滤波器的增强语音信号补偿粒子滤波器建模能力。

Result: 合成数据集上算法间的自回归相互作用提高跟踪精度和增强性能，真实录音听力测试表明所提自转向管道是更优选择。

Conclusion: 所提策略能在动态场景下以低复杂度实现良好语音增强效果，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

Motivation: 开放银行带来金融数据管理变革，金融机构面临数据流入流出管理的机遇和挑战，需要了解客户数据共享倾向。

Method: 引入预测框架，采用结合ADASYN和NEARMISS技术的混合数据平衡策略训练XGBoost模型，用SHAP和CART技术进行EMA。

Result: XGBoost模型预测客户数据共享准确率高，流入为91.39%，流出为91.53%，EMA揭示影响客户决策的关键特征。

Conclusion: 移动参与和信用在驱动客户数据共享行为中起关键作用，为金融机构在开放银行环境提升竞争力和创新提供战略见解。

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

Motivation: 解决毫米波MIMO系统中直接通信路径受阻时的吞吐量问题，且传统ES方法计算复杂、耗时。

Method: 使用置换离散傅里叶变换向量进行码本设计，开发训练好的DNN进行快速码字选择。

Result: 仿真表明，在测试阶段即使终端用户与RIS之间的距离有变化，DNN仍能保持次优频谱效率。

Conclusion: DNN在推进RIS辅助系统方面有潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Conclusion: 成功构建合作博弈论概念框架，明确博弈组合性质及解概念在组合下的行为。

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to settle a conceptual framework for
cooperative game theory in which the notion of composition/aggregation of games
is the defining structure. This is done via the mathematical theory of
algebraic operads: we start by endowing the collection of all cooperative games
with any number of players with an operad structure, and we show that it
generalises all the previous notions of sums, products and compositions of
games considered by Owen, Shapley, von Neumann and Morgenstern, and many
others. Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators
and relations, showing that the M\"obius transform map induces a canonical
isomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes
commutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any
cooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the
2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many
interesting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures
and convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and
thus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity
theorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra.
Finally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave
under composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of
the core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value
and the Banzhaf index of a compound game.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track

AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

Motivation: 工业视觉系统中收集高质量训练数据耗时久，现有合成数据方法有局限，扩散模型虽有潜力但精确控制难，不同条件方案对合成数据质量影响不明。

Method: 研究来自四个标准目标检测基准的80个视觉概念，比较基于提示和基于布局的两种条件策略。

Result: 条件提示集窄时，提示条件生成的合成数据质量更高；多样性增加时，布局条件更优。布局提示匹配完整训练分布时，合成数据平均精度均值较仅用真实数据提升显著。

Conclusion: 布局条件在生成高多样性合成数据用于目标检测时表现更好，能有效提升检测精度。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent有潜力成为手术辅助的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Conclusion: MAGIC能有效解决少样本异常生成的三个问题，在相关任务中有更好表现。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种全自动的Willis环分叉点地标检测方法，经实验验证该方法在分叉检测任务上性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检测Willis环（CoW）的关键地标对颅内动脉瘤（ICA）的及时有效诊断十分必要。

Method: 采用两步神经网络方法，先用目标检测网络识别地标附近的感兴趣区域，再用带深度监督的改进U - Net精确定位分叉点。

Result: 使用两个脑磁共振血管造影（MRA）数据集评估，该方法在分叉检测任务上达到最高性能水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的两步神经网络方法能有效解决地标检测中的问题，且能适应CoW的解剖变异性，在分叉检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新图像分词器Hita用于自回归图像生成，加速训练且性能优越，还在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成模型难以捕获全局关系，多数视觉分词器全局信息有限。

Method: 引入整体到局部的分词方案，结合可学习的整体查询和局部块令牌，采用两种策略改善与自回归生成过程的对齐。

Result: 加速AR生成器训练速度，在ImageNet基准上表现优于传统分词器，实现2.59 FID和281.9 IS。

Conclusion: Hita能捕获全局图像属性，在零样本风格迁移和图像修复中有效。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

TL;DR: 提出利用像素级时间不一致性的深度伪造视频检测方法，性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于空间频率的检测器常忽略像素级时间不一致性，难以检测像素平面的时间伪影。

Method: 对每个像素的时间轴进行一维傅里叶变换提取特征，引入端到端训练的注意力提议模块定位伪影区域，联合变压器模块整合特征。

Result: 框架能检测到更多伪造伪影，在多样且具挑战性的检测场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架在深度伪造视频检测上有显著进步。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多行人跟踪方法在复杂场景困难，现有数据集存在场景简单、不真实、数量不足问题，无法满足从标注数据学习跟踪的需求。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集能为复杂场景下有效的算法开发提供平台。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Result: 与先前方法相比，碎片化率降低2.2倍。

Conclusion: 强调了息肉计数中时间感知的重要性，达到新的技术水平。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Motivation: 当前视觉材料作GA的潜力未充分挖掘，且设计有效GA需高级可视化技能阻碍其广泛应用。

Method: 引入SciGA - 145k数据集，定义Intra - GA和Inter - GA推荐两个任务，提供基线模型，提出Confidence Adjusted top - 1 ground truth Ratio (CAR)指标。

Result: 建立了用于GA选择、推荐和自动生成研究的数据集，定义了相关任务，提供了基线模型和新指标。

Conclusion: SciGA - 145k为推进视觉科学交流和科学人工智能发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有助于解决AI应用于VBN算法故障检测时数据集不足的问题。

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决基于VFM的领域提示调优中解开不变特征的挑战，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Result: APT有效缓解过拟合，保留先验知识，在有限参考数据下生成高质量、多样化图像方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APT能有效解决用有限数据个性化扩散模型时的相关问题。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Conclusion: 所提出的FairHuman方法在人体图像生成中有效。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Result: 在图像分类和达西流任务上，MANO可与ViT和Swin Transformer等模型媲美，大幅降低运行时间和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: MANO是一种有效处理高分辨率输入的方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Conclusion: TAB Net是一种有效的弱监督医学图像分割框架，能解决涂鸦标注带来的问题。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning

crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督数据增强时空注意力扩散网络（USAD）有效解决了人类活动识别的现有问题，具备良好性能和实用性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Motivation: 为了将室内环境的RGB - D扫描转换为紧凑、逼真且可交互的3D虚拟副本，支持图形管道关键特性。

Method: 先进行场景理解并解析结果到3D布局和对象，从资产数据库检索相似模型重建场景，用Material Painting模块增强真实感，最后集成到模拟引擎。有免训练对象检索模块和鲁棒的材质绘制模块。

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is
available at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

TL;DR: 本文利用依赖类型高阶逻辑（DHOL），为其扩展了细化和商类型，介绍扩展语言语法、语义和到HOL的转换并证明相关性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DHOL在表达性和自动化支持间取得平衡，而细化和商类型是实践者常用但自动定理证明器很少提供的，DHOL可为此提供基础。

Method: 将细化和商类型作为子类型的特殊情况添加，避免表示上的昂贵更改，并给出扩展语言的语法、语义及到HOL的转换。

Result: 成功为DHOL扩展了细化和商类型，给出相关语法、语义和转换，并证明了正确性和完备性。

Conclusion: 利用DHOL的设计扩展细化和商类型不仅可行，而且优雅简单。

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

Conclusion: 所提策略和架构能有效提升QCNN的特征处理能力、分类准确率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MetaFO是人工智能驱动超材料发现的范式转变，为下一代创新铺平道路。

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效利用5G PRS信号实现多基地ISAC的目标检测、定位和跟踪。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型降低软件开发门槛，但也使恶意软件开发更易，现有防护机制存在漏洞，需研究利用该漏洞的攻击方法。

Method: 引入MGC框架，通过模块化分解和规避对齐的方式生成恶意软件，采用Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR)连接恶意意图和看似良性的代码片段。

Result: 攻击能在不同任务规格和类别中可靠生成功能性恶意软件，在三个基准数据集上正确性优于越狱方法365.79%、地下服务78.07%，还能复现和增强16个真实世界恶意软件样本。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了针对对齐AI系统的组合攻击风险，为安全研究人员提供关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出EIM - TRNG利用DRAM单元行为随机性生成随机数，用于保护DNN权重数据，验证了其在硬件安全中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件伪随机数生成器缺乏硬件真随机数生成器的不可预测性和抗干扰性，保护DNN模型参数很重要。

Method: 提出EIM - TRNG，利用DRAM单元在RowHammer干扰下的不可预测位翻转作为熵源，结合固定和不可预测位翻转编码保护DNN权重数据，用概率翻转行为导出的密钥解密。

Result: 验证了基于DRAM的熵提取在硬件安全中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于DRAM的熵提取为低成本硬件安全提供有效方法，为硬件层面保护机器学习模型提供方向。

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

Motivation: 传统机器学习检测器误报率高，标准单通RAG管道检索无关上下文且无法合理解释预测，需改进网络入侵检测与预防系统。

Method: 提出CyberRAG，由中央大语言模型代理协调专业分类器、工具适配器和迭代检索推理循环，采用以代理为中心的架构。

Conclusion: 以代理为中心、面向专家的RAG能兼顾高检测准确率和可靠解释，为半自主网络防御工作流提供实用可扩展途径。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Motivation: 提示注入攻击对集成大语言模型的应用构成重大安全威胁，而现有的模型级防御以闭源方式部署在商业模型中，AI安全社区需要开源模型来推动对抗提示注入攻击的科学进步。

Method: 开发Meta SecAlign，利用改进版的SOTA SecAlign防御方法，并提供完整的训练方案。

Result: 在9个实用基准和7个安全基准测试中，Meta SecAlign在未见的下游任务中展现出安全性，其最佳模型Meta - SecAlign - 70B在抵御提示注入攻击方面达到SOTA水平，实用性能与有模型级防御的闭源商业大模型相当。

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign是有效的开源模型级防御方案，能推动AI安全研究的发展。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

TL;DR: 评估前沿大语言模型的隐写能力，发现当前模型隐写能力尚弱但未来可能改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型输出监测重要，但模型可能通过隐写逃避监测，需评估其隐写能力以了解风险。

Method: 聚焦传递编码消息和执行编码推理两种隐写类型进行评估。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下编码短消息易被发现，有额外条件可成功；有进行基本编码推理的早期迹象，但难在掩护任务中隐蔽推理。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型有初步隐写能力，目前不足以绕过设计良好的监测器，但未来可能改变。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Conclusion: 提出识别意外行为和构建有效解释的算法，可融入BDI推理过程，推动人机交互

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

Method: 提出基于循环架构的认知启发自监督学习方案构建轨迹模型。

Result: 模型仅用给定的正逆运动学模型就能学习生成轨迹。

Conclusion: 该新方法能促进需要自适应解决方案的更复杂操作任务的规划。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Result: 模型在模拟数据集上训练，具有较强的从模拟到真实的迁移能力，在模拟和真实数据上的评估显示其在真实机器人系统上有效。

Conclusion: 提出的VLA方法训练高效、与机器人实体无关，能有效完成复杂机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

Motivation: 现有路径规划多关注最优距离，需平衡响应时间、路径安全和长度，且骨架化算法资源消耗大，故提出高效路径规划方法。

Method: 利用基于U-Net架构的深度去噪自编码器（DDAE）计算导航地图的骨架化版本SkelUnet，通过一次采样（OSS）探索整个工作空间，在二维地牢地图数据集上训练和测试SkelUnet。

Result: 使用SkelUnet构建路线图具有连接自由工作区所有区域、提供更安全路径和减少处理时间等优势。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于结构化环境中的移动服务机器人。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Conclusion: AC - Refiner框架能有效优化算术电路设计，在电路优化方面表现良好。

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We

investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Result: ASDA模型在音频分类、关键词检测和环境声音分类等多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ASDA模型在音频任务中有效，为更广泛应用奠定基础。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Conclusion: 所提两种算法在无监督语音增强中表现良好，有实际应用价值

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Motivation: 现有经典力场、量子力学方法和AI力场在生物分子模拟中存在精度、效率或泛化性等局限。

Method: 引入LiTEN，用Tensorized Quadrangle Attention（TQA）高效建模三、四体相互作用；构建LiTEN - FF基础模型，在nablaDFT数据集预训练、SPICE微调。

Result: LiTEN在多个评估子集达SOTA性能，LiTEN - FF可进行多种下游建模任务，推理速度比MACE - OFF快10倍。

Conclusion: 提出的框架推动复杂生物分子建模，为药物发现等应用提供基础。

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

Conclusion: SynTwins有效弥合了计算设计和实验合成的差距，为加速发现具有所需性质的可合成分子提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型解码策略用于RTL代码生成时，常无法满足结构和语义要求，导致输出有问题。

Result: 在多个开源大语言模型上使用VerilogEval基准评估，在语法有效性、功能正确性和输出多样性上有显著提升，执行开销可忽略。

Conclusion: DecoRTL策略能有效解决传统解码策略在RTL代码生成中的问题。

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

Conclusion: LLMs在全脑神经回路解析方面有很强的能力。

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

Conclusion: 该研究有助于优化瓦楞包装设计，简化有限元模型以实现更快且准确的模拟。

Abstract: This study presents a simplified FEM modeling approach suitable for large
structures made of corrugated boards, such as customized packages, based on a
homogenization method, which is combined with correction factors for internal
mechanisms. The homogenization process reduces computational time by
transforming flute geometries into equivalent elastic models. In large
deformations and in the presence of contact for a given geometry, the effective
elastic modulus in the thickness direction, as well as the effective thickness
of the structure, are corrected by two statistical Weibull distributions
representing the contact and buckling mechanisms in a corrugated board. The
Weibull parameters are obtained via experimental analysis, and such a process
is then validated. The results demonstrate that the statistical parameters
($\beta_1 = 0.14$, $\beta_2 = 1.31$) can be used for the simplistic
representation of corrugated boards, being computationally efficient. This
research contributes to the optimization of corrugated packaging design,
specifically by simplifying FEM models for faster yet equally accurate
simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work aims to model the hypersurface of the effective elastic modulus, \(
E_{z, \text{eff}} \), and thickness, \( th_{\text{eff}} \), in corrugated
boards. A Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is followed by Gaussian Process
Regression (GP), enhanced by EHVI as a multi-objective acquisition function.
Accurate modeling of \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \) and \( th_{\text{eff}} \) is
critical for optimizing the mechanical properties of corrugated materials in
engineering applications. LHS provides an efficient and straightforward
approach for an initial sampling of the input space; GP is expected to be able
to adapt to the complexity of the response surfaces by incorporating both
prediction and uncertainty. Therefore, the next points being generated and
evaluated are based on the complexity of the hypersurfaces, and some points,
especially those with higher variance, are more exploited and carry more
importance. The performance of GP with EHVI is measured by Mean Squared Error
(MSE). Prediction of GP resulted in \( \text{MSE}(E_{z, \text{eff}}) = 5.24 \,
\text{kPa}^2 \) and \( \text{MSE}(th_{\text{eff}}) = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 \). GP
possesses then improved accuracy and adaptability for future applications in
structural optimization.
