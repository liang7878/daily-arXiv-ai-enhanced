However, existing works have low serving performance\nfor these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent\nlatency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose\nKairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency\nfor multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a\nworkflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher.

However, most algorithms require a\nsynchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources\nand time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all\nthe available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being\nscheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence\nin asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and\ncheck for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the\nglobal state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the\nnecessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that\nguarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for\nvarious problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for\nseveral existing algorithms that they can be executed without any\nsynchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in\nproving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies\nthat we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the\nlocal state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather\nthan generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of\ncycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social,\nis phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken\nto converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature\nversus the algorithms that we design.

The UPMEM implementation achieves up to\n$259\\times$ better performance for inference of large batch sizes when compared\nagainst the CPU that exploits the size of the available PiM memory.\nAdditionally, two smaller MLPs were implemented using UPMEM's working SRAM\n(WRAM), a scratchpad memory, to evaluate their performance against a low-power\nNvidia Jetson graphics processing unit (GPU), providing further insights into\nthe efficiency of UPMEM's PiM for neural network inference.

USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR).

Under the standard bounded domain\nassumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any\nalgorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in\nall parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\\mathsf{p}$), suggesting\nthat OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation\n(e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A\nparticularly interesting one is the first provable convergence result for\nnonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient\nclipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and\nextend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases\nsimultaneously."}

Unlike existing methods that\nenforce fairness through supervised learning, which may lead to\novercompensation and degraded performance, our framework achieves fairness in\nan unsupervised manner with minimal performance loss. We apply our framework to\nreal-world urban mobility datasets and demonstrate its ability to close\nfairness gaps while delivering competitive predictive performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art fairness-aware methods."}

By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality.

This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

To address this issue, we propose a novel method\nnamed Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing\nnegative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,\nCNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus\nreduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal\nregularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental\nconfounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives\nthat promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive\nexperiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate\nthat CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation\nmetrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and\nrobustness in OOD recommendation tasks."}

However, a persistent concern remains\nunresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the\nactual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We\nsummarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)\nTheoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among\nmethods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,\nclarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,\nrigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles.

In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal.

Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the\nweights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This\navoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation\ntasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.\nExperiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object\ndetection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and\naccuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6\nFPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD\nperformance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers\nstable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at\nhttps://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD."}

In the space\nalignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the\nsemantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the\nrecommendation models. In addition, two training\nstrategies--\\textbf{all-parameters training} and \\textbf{extractor-only\ntraining}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and\napplication scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a\nnovel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation. Experimental results\nvalidate the necessity and effectiveness of both the knowledge filtering and\nalignment modules, and further demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe extractor-only training strategy."}

First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series\nand Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of\nthe low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while\nGPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is\nsignificantly improved."}

This directly\nimplies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational\nresources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is\ngargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in\nreal time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to\nperform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the\nuniverse and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering,\nknown as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies\nas high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine\nlearning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to\nmaximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern\nhardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in\norder to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.\nIn this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for\ncharged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The\npipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely\non GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms\ncurrently in production at LHCb.

We\nintroduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds\nfrom dialogue transcripts.

Researchers can customize prompts and visualization\nparameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user\nstudy comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155\ntranscripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device\nconcerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,\nBERTopic).

These\ninaccuracies, combined with automation bias, where humans overrely on AI\npredictions, can result in worse decisions. Selective prediction, in which\npotentially unreliable model predictions are hidden from users, has been\nproposed as a solution. This approach assumes that when AI abstains and informs\nthe user so, humans make decisions as they would without AI involvement. To\ntest this assumption, we study the effects of selective prediction on human\ndecisions in a clinical context. We conducted a user study of 259 clinicians\ntasked with diagnosing and treating hospitalized patients. We compared their\nbaseline performance without any AI involvement to their AI-assisted accuracy\nwith and without selective prediction. Our findings indicate that selective\nprediction mitigates the negative effects of inaccurate AI in terms of decision\naccuracy. Compared to no AI assistance, clinician accuracy declined when shown\ninaccurate AI predictions (66% [95% CI: 56%-75%] vs. 56% [95% CI: 46%-66%]),\nbut recovered under selective prediction (64% [95% CI: 54%-73%]). However,\nwhile selective prediction nearly maintains overall accuracy, our results\nsuggest that it alters patterns of mistakes: when informed the AI abstains,\nclinicians underdiagnose (18% increase in missed diagnoses) and undertreat (35%\nincrease in missed treatments) compared to no AI input at all.

This\nis the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of\ndesigning AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This\nproblem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations\nrefer to \\emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)\nvalues and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a\ntreatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)\nincommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the\ntreatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible\nonly if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This\npaper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,\nwhich has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains\n(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph\nanalysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making\n(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be\nused to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec\nmethod is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary\ndecision-making.

We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions.

However,\nexisting approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it\ndifficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series\nAIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series\nEncoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a\nCross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data\nand textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture\nenables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,\nanomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single\nend-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms\nexisting methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.\nFurthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation\nsummaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent\nand efficient maritime traffic management."}

However,\nexisting methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained\nsubtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking\nthe ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,\nfailing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,\nthis paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via\nbiologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's\n\"where-what\" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an\nenvironment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object\nfunctions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain\ntransfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill\nlearning module for task execution, which processes self-state information\nincluding joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill\ntransfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes.

To utilize CBAs better, we\nneed to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall\nshort of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a\ncounterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers\nworking on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the\ninformation in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),\nrequired functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and\ntheir prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall\nsatisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =\n3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most\ncommon factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code\nquality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We\ndelve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying\nchallenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers\nto incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial\nCBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present\ndesign opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs."}

Forty drivers participated in our experiment using a\nmotion-based driving simulator, comparing three conditions (No agent,\nPre-scripted agent, and ChatGPT-based agent) as a within-subjects variable.\nResults showed that the ChatGPT-based agent condition led to more stable\ndriving performance across multiple metrics. Participants demonstrated lower\nvariability in longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, and lane\ndeviation compared to the other two conditions. In subjective evaluations, the\nChatGPT-based agent also received significantly higher ratings in competence,\nanimacy, affective trust, and preference compared to the Pre-scripted agent.\nOur thematic analysis of driver-agent conversations revealed diverse\ninteraction patterns in topics, including driving assistance/questions,\nentertainment requests, and anthropomorphic interactions.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings.

In the medical domain, decision-making often requires\nintegrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,\nstructured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist\nmultimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates\nits zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based\nquestion answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified\nprotocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20\nagainst standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU\nmedical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that\nGPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in\nmultimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in\nmost dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to\nintegrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,\nrecommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on\nthese controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from\nhuman-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may\nsubstantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems."}

Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a\nLow-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a\nfundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the\nGaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of\ngenerative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM\nmid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based\non this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a\nuniversal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR\ninjects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,\nincorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the\nlatent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to\neliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we\ninstantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:\nOMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and\nqualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes\noverwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a\n1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which\nyields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We\nalso generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our\ntwo-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion."}

We break away from the typical generative approach that learns\nfrom a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a\ncode-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration\nwith artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of\nspecialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender\nscripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code\nworks as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented\nrepresentation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender\nconstructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,\nunconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues\nfor further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or\nprocedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our\nsystem: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while\niterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared\ncode context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a\nretrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API\ndocumentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions\nempowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material\nedits, and user-driven refinements.

Current methods, however, often prioritize basic\nvisual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse\nshot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This\nyields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication\nand true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user\nstudies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence\nto intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its\nability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically\ncoherent subsequent shots."}
