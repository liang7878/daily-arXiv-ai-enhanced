However,\nthe data required for a life cycle assessment (LCA) that maps the materials and\nprocesses from product manufacturing to disposal into environmental impacts\n(EI) are often unavailable. Here we reimagine conventional LCA by introducing\nmultimodal AI agents that emulate interactions between LCA experts and\nstakeholders like product managers and engineers to calculate the\ncradle-to-gate (production) carbon emissions of electronic devices. The AI\nagents iteratively generate a detailed life-cycle inventory leveraging a custom\ndata abstraction and software tools that extract information from online text\nand images from repair communities and government certifications. This approach\nreduces weeks or months of expert time to under one minute and closes data\navailability gaps while yielding carbon footprint estimates within 19% of\nexpert LCAs with zero proprietary data. Additionally, we develop a method to\ndirectly estimate EI by comparing an input to a cluster of products with\nsimilar descriptions and known carbon footprints. This runs in 3 ms on a laptop\nwith a MAPE of 12.28% on electronic products. Further, we develop a data-driven\nmethod to generate emission factors. We use the properties of an unknown\nmaterial to represent it as a weighted sum of emission factors for similar\nmaterials.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework.

Given a\nlarge input network $G$, a motif $H$ is a small \"pattern\" graph indicative of\nspecial local structure. Motif/pattern mining involves finding all matches of\nthis pattern in the input $G$. The simplest, yet challenging, case of motif\ncounting is when $H$ has three vertices, often called a \"triadic\" query. Recent\nwork has focused on \"temporal graph mining\", where the network $G$ has edges\nwith timestamps (and directions) and $H$ has time constraints.\n  Inspired by concepts in logic and database theory, we introduce the study of\n\"thresholded First Order Logic (FOL) Motif Analysis\" for massive temporal\nnetworks. A typical triadic motif query asks for the existence of three\nvertices that form a desired temporal pattern. An \"FOL\" motif query is obtained\nby having both existential and thresholded universal quantifiers. This allows\nfor query semantics that can mine richer information from networks. A typical\ntriadic query would be \"find all triples of vertices $u,v,w$ such that they\nform a triangle within one hour\". A thresholded FOL query can express \"find all\npairs $u,v$ such that for half of $w$ where $(u,w)$ formed an edge, $(v,w)$\nalso formed an edge within an hour\".\n  We design the first algorithm, FOLTY, for mining thresholded FOL triadic\nqueries. The theoretical running time of FOLTY matches the best known running\ntime for temporal triangle counting in sparse graphs. We give an efficient\nimplementation of FOLTY using specialized temporal data structures.

Then, we\nselect the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples\nfrom other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.\nFinally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are\nutilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic\nrepresentation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation.

This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance\nestimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is\nconstrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each\nobserve different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random\nvector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using\na limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight\nminimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and\nFrobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong\ndata processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data\nProcessing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI\ncoefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional\nSDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent\nchannel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient\nover the state input.\n  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,\nwe compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels.

While recent works on GPU-based acceleration\nhave significantly advanced ANNS performance, the ever-growing scale of\ndatasets now demands efficient multi-GPU solutions. However, the design of\nexisting works overlooks multi-GPU scalability, resulting in naive approaches\nthat treat additional GPUs as a means to extend memory capacity for large\ndatasets. This inefficiency arises from partitioning the dataset and\nindependently searching for data points similar to the queries in each GPU. We\ntherefore propose PathWeaver, a novel multi-GPU framework designed to scale and\naccelerate ANNS for large datasets.

Despite the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautomate software engineering tasks, their ability to generate CI\nconfigurations remains underexplored. This paper presents a preliminary study\nevaluating six LLMs for generating GitHub Actions configurations from natural\nlanguage descriptions. We assess three general-purpose foundation models\n(GPT-4o, Llama, and Gemma) and three code-pretrained models (GPT-4.1, Code\nLlama, and CodeGemma). We also introduce the first labeled dataset of its kind,\nconstructed from GitHub Actions documentation, pairing descriptions with\ncorresponding best-practice YAML configurations.

In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a\nnovel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue\ngeneration. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to\ngenerate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we\nfirst employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.\nThis results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine\ncrack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The\ndifference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a\nfine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is\nunaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting.

But evaluating the accuracy of neural\nposterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from\nmajor limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.\nBuilding on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a\nconformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores\n-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample\np-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:\n(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that\ndegrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot\nis that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and\nreliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical\ndiscriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks.

To address these limitations, we\npropose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating\nVisual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent\nfor generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image\nrepresentations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances\ntextual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach\nsignificantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,\nand recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the\nlargest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by\n15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%.

With the growing integration of renewables and increasing system\ncomplexity, microgrid communities face significant challenges in real-time\nenergy scheduling and optimization under uncertainty. DiffCarl integrates a\ndiffusion model into a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to enable\nadaptive energy scheduling under uncertainty and explicitly account for carbon\nemissions and operational risk. By learning action distributions through a\ndenoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and\nenables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid\nenvironments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms\nclassic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower\noperational cost.

This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP.

Current algorithmic\napproaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often\nfailing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large\nlanguage models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies\nacross various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core\nresearch proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity\nevaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two\ndatasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains,\nfocusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional\nproxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the\nefficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that\neven the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the\nperformance of conventional metrics.

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or\none-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps\nnoise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first\nprinciples of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite\nintegrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is\nsignificantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,\nresulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware\ncompatibility.

While deep\nlearning models have improved optical-assisted diagnostics, they often demand\nextensive labeled datasets and yield \"black-box\" outputs with limited\ninterpretability. In this paper, we propose EndoFinder, an online polyp\nretrieval framework that leverages multi-view scene representations for\nexplainable and scalable CRC diagnosis. First, we develop a Polyp-aware Image\nEncoder by combining contrastive learning and a reconstruction task, guided by\npolyp segmentation masks. This self-supervised approach captures robust\nfeatures without relying on large-scale annotated data. Next, we treat each\npolyp as a three-dimensional \"scene\" and introduce a Scene Representation\nTransformer, which fuses multiple views of the polyp into a single latent\nrepresentation. By discretizing this representation through a hashing layer,\nEndoFinder enables real-time retrieval from a compiled database of historical\npolyp cases, where diagnostic information serves as interpretable references\nfor new queries. We evaluate EndoFinder on both public and newly collected\npolyp datasets for re-identification and pathology classification. Results show\nthat EndoFinder outperforms existing methods in accuracy while providing\ntransparent, retrieval-based insights for clinical decision-making.

Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a\npersonalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to\nachieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models\ntailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and\nprivacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers\nclients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without\nsharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,\nenvironmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server.

This restriction hinders large-scale longitudinal\nstudies of API evolution and fine-grained analyses such as commit-level BC\ndetection. In this paper, we introduce Roseau, a novel static analysis tool\nthat constructs technology-agnostic API models from library code equipped with\nrich semantic analyses. API models can be analyzed to study API evolution and\ncompared to identify BCs between any two versions of a library (releases,\ncommits, branches, etc.). Unlike traditional approaches, Roseau can build API\nmodels from source code or bytecode, and is optimized for large-scale\nlongitudinal analyses of library histories. We assess the accuracy,\nperformance, and suitability of Roseau for longitudinal studies of API\nevolution, using JApiCmp and Revapi as baselines.

However, these models\noccasionally produce outputs that contain proprietary or sensitive code\nsnippets, raising concerns about potential non-compliant use of training data,\nand posing risks to privacy and intellectual property. To ensure responsible\nand compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become\na critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural\nlanguage settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely\nunderexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured\nsyntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To\naddress this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven\nstate-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance\nacross eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a\nfunction-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three\nprogramming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded\nfrom CodeLLM training.

This capability is essential for\ndownstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior\napproaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code\nreasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize\nacross diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low\nquality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which\nstruggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we\npropose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a\ntwo-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets\nthat focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply\ninstruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a\npowerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through\nGRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model.

A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the\ncontext of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both\nnarrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a\nuser successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher\n- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform\nevidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various\ninstitutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound\npolicies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and\nimplementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world\nmisalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's\nreflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment\nas a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political\nneutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user\nexhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing\nstrategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different\nperspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new\nforms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1HoPeS\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4f1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u591a\u5143\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u6613\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1HoPeS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee3\u8868\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u534f\u8bae\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6709\u632b\u8d25\u611f\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u52a8\u529b\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u534f\u8bae\u6709\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4f1a\u751f\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In this second part of a two part series, we extend\nBilevel Local Operator Learning (BiLO) for PDE-constrained optimization\nproblems developed in Part 1 to the Bayesian inference framework. At the lower\nlevel, we train a network to approximate the local solution operator by\nminimizing the local operator loss with respect to the weights of the neural\nnetwork. At the upper level, we sample the PDE parameters from the posterior\ndistribution. We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with\nexisting methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the\nchallenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights\nand does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network\nsolution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the\nPDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method\nimproves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty\nquantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC\nsampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact\nminimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between\nthe tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the\nresulting uncertainty quantification.

While compressibility and robustness have each been\nstudied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains\nelusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations.

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is\na \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to\nsub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the\nsub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these\nsub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from\nan issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally\nevaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5\nmodels with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.

We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs).

This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use\nmodern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first\npropose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR\nmodels for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes\nall possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a\ntheoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves\npotential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the\nmethod applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We\nprovide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762\ndatasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the\ndependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount\nof context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with\nrecent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors\nderived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGOP - SA\u548cGOP - AF\u7528\u4e8eMDD\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d1\u97f3\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6570MDD\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eGOP\u9700\u9884\u5206\u5272\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eCTC\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGOP - SA\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8eCTC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ASR\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8eMDD\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49GOP - AF\u8003\u8651\u76ee\u6807\u97f3\u7d20\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728CMU Kids\u548cSpeechocean762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1GOP - AF\u5bf9\u58f0\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5cf0\u503c\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u97f3\u7d20\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u97f3\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d1\u97f3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\u3002"}}

Besides, by introducing a\nself-attention mechanism for multivariable fusion in the latent space, the\nperformance achieves further improvements. Empirically, extensive experiments\nshow the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it reduces\nthe MSE for near-surface air temperature and relative humidity predictions by\n28.82\\% and 23.39\\%, respectively.

Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier.

Due to\nits low communication requirements, distributed SGD (D-SGD) remains the\nmainstream optimizer in such challenging networks, but it still suffers from\nsignificant throughput reduction. To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters. Unfortunately, existing works rely on\nstatic heuristic strategies due to the lack of theoretical guidance, which\nprevents them from achieving this goal. This study fills in this theoretical\ngap by introducing a new theoretical tool, decomposing the joint optimization\nproblem into a traditional convergence rate analysis with multiple analyzable\nnoise terms. We are the first to reveal that staleness exponentially amplifies\nthe negative impact of gradient compression on training performance, filling a\ncritical gap in understanding how compressed and delayed gradients affect\ntraining. Furthermore, by integrating the convergence rate with a network-aware\ntime minimization condition, we propose DeCo-SGD, which dynamically adjusts the\ncompression ratio and staleness based on the real-time network condition and\ntraining task.

We define the former as a\npreprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of\noutliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for\nquantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the\nerrors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We\nevaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization\nmethods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and\nits performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation\nand scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and\ncombining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ\nalone for quantization error mitigation. Furthermore, we explore the potential\nof the latest MXFP4 quantization and reveal that the optimal pre-quantization\ntransformation strategy for INT4 does not generalize well to MXFP4, inspiring\nfurther investigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u53caMXFP4\u683c\u5f0f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7efc\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u9884\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u4e24\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7f13\u89e3\u4e2d\u4f4e\u79e9\u8865\u507f\u7ed3\u5408GPTQ\u6709\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u7528GPTQ\uff1bINT4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8eMXFP4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate\nnormalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively\nmodulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,\nactivations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of\ngradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the\nnormalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on\ntwo popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its\ncounterparts (\\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with\nvanilla mSGDW.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Transformer (DNT)\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528mSGDW\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0eAdamW\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Transformer\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u96be\u4ee5\u7528mSGDW\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u6b64\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5728Transformer\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u6210\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8c03\u8282\u6bcf\u5c42\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53ca\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "DNT\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7528mSGDW\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "DNT\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u7528mSGDW\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not\ndesigned to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can\ncapture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to\nsystem noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes\nthe optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional\nmetric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies\nbetween probability distributions.

Given two alternative\nmodel responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the \"better\"\nresponse. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded\nmetrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping\nmodel evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise\ncomparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for\nresponses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh\nwriting quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore\naugmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve\nperformance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and\ncode tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality\nfeedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to\nground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal\nknowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our\nmethod across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation\ntasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as\nthree new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets.

Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further\nproposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class\nprototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all\nunknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly\nmodels them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a\nrobust open-set recognition.

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss.

EGO is a heuristic BO method that performs well in terms of solution\nquality. However, like any other global optimization method, EGO suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality, meaning that its performance is satisfactory on\nlower dimensional problems, but deteriorates as the dimensionality of the\noptimization search space increases. For realistic aircraft design problems,\nthe typical size of the design variables can even exceed 100 and, thus, trying\nto solve directly the problems using EGO is ruled out. The latter is especially\ntrue when the problems involve both continuous and categorical variables\nincreasing even more the size of the search space. In this Ph.D thesis,\neffective parameterization tools are investigated, including techniques like\npartial least squares regression, to significantly reduce the number of design\nvariables.

However, most existing approaches are\nsingle-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based\nmethods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on\nthe Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth\nestimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of\n3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction\nnetwork called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided\nview transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth\ndistributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through\ndiffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and\nselectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified\nregions.

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we\npresent a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate\nclass-specific features to recognize subcellular categories.

We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools.

We begin\nwith extensive benchmarking to understand the critical relationship between\ntask success and calibration error across multiple datasets and VLA variants,\nfinding that task performance and calibration are not in tension.

Their\ninfluence is especially pronounced in small sample sizes, where detecting and\nremoving outliers becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, it is essential to\nestimate treatment effects robustly without excluding these influential data\npoints. To address this, we propose a doubly robust point estimator for the\naverage treatment effect under a contaminated model that includes outliers.\nRobustness in outcome regression is achieved through a robust estimating\nequation, while covariate balancing propensity scores (CBPS) ensure resilience\nin propensity score modeling.\n  To prevent model overfitting due to the inclusion of numerous parameters, we\nincorporate variable selection. All these components are unified under a\npenalized empirical likelihood framework.

These predictions guide adaptive waveform\ndesign via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to\nenhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring\nsufficient power for high-SNR targets. The reward function in the underlying\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is also modified to\nprioritize accurate spatial and power estimation.\n  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the\neffectiveness of our method.

Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been\nexplored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely\ndata-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths\nof both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as\nlearning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between\nsimulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world\nmeasurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven\nmodels, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the\ndata-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.\nFirst, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting\nthe inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and\noccupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a\nprobabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating\nfive representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy\nmodeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a\nreal-world case study.

The objective\nfunction value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at\na high query cost. Existing methods use a \"sign trick\" in gradient estimation\nto reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the\nquality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach\nto improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.\nSpecifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and\nour gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the\nprojection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and\nrandom directions, in a query-efficient manner.

Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a\npre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting\nattention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT\nattention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying\nGaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal\ncorrelation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest\nalignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found\nbetween attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest\ndivergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate\nthat while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal\nattention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,\nparticularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items.
