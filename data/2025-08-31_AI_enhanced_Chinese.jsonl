Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core\ninstead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting\nnew allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software\nand hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and\nMemento.

To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal\ntwo-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of\nreinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on\nsimulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly\ncriterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment\nobjectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense\nEncoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework\nfor continuous decision-making.

Because these solvers sit on the\ncritical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas\nare key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed\nwell on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly\nevolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show\npromise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:\nnearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative\ninteractions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In\nthis study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that\naddresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the\nsynthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,\nChimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for\nSMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)\nsynthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.\nDuring fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing\nformulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.\nThis design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.\nNotably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,\ndramatically reducing runtime cost.

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer.

Experimental evaluations on various public\ndatasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing\nthe root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore\nthe effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root\ncause localization in complex microservice environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u6790\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRCLAgent\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e13\u4e1aSRE\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u6839\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u601d\u7ef4\u9012\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u7684RCLAgent\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRCLAgent\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6839\u56e0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u805a\u5408\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RCLAgent\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast\nequilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional\ndistributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality:\ndynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state\nvariable (\"Master equation\" a.k.a. \"Monster equation\"). Frontier computational\nmethods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it\nimplausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems.\nThese difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent\napproach to central questions in macroeconomics -- those involving aggregate\nrisk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of\nthe rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it?\nI outline three criteria for alternative approaches: (1) computational\ntractability, (2) consistency with empirical evidence, and (3) (some) immunity\nto the Lucas critique.

In a semi-Markov model, the rates can depend on the time spent in the\ncurrent state, though available methods for this are either restricted to\nspecific state structures or lack general software. This paper develops the\napproach of using a \"phase-type\" distribution for the sojourn time in a state,\nwhich expresses a semi-Markov model as a hidden Markov model, allowing the\nlikelihood to be calculated easily for any state structure. While this approach\ninvolves a proliferation of latent parameters, identifiability can be improved\nby restricting the phase-type family to one which approximates a simpler\ndistribution such as the Gamma or Weibull. This paper proposes a\nmoment-matching method to obtain this approximation, making general semi-Markov\nmodels for intermittent data accessible in software for the first time.

Recently, within the framework of network\nrenormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an\narbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an\narbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed.\nHere we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context\nwhere the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or\nprivacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic\nnetworks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to\nconfidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying\nnetwork from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network\nreconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is\ndesigned to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the\nlimitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield\npredictions across different resolution levels. Finally, we propose their\nnatural 'renormalizable' counterparts derived from the distinct principle of\nscale invariance, yielding consistent graph embeddings for multi-scale network\nreconstruction.

A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture\nstudents' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,\nand students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students\nexhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use\nAI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across\ninteractions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting\nstrategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral\nmetrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral\nmechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical\nimplications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It\nemphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's\nfamiliarity and effective use of AI tools.

However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a\nway that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other\nstakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science\ncommunity's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs\namong stakeholders in the real world.\n  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism\nmanagement to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic\ndecision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize\nliterature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.\nOur findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the\nspecific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and\nparticipatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research\nperspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of\nthe stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive\nfactors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few\nmathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the\nmultidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.\n  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of\npurely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for\nfuture interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a\nfundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems\ntowards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u65c5\u6e38\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u65c5\u6e38\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6e38\u5ba2\u6d41\u5411\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u3001\u793e\u533a\u7b49\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u5bf9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u65c5\u6e38\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6587\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u65c5\u6e38\u7ba1\u7406\u79ef\u6781\u8bc6\u522b\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u7b49\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u8003\u8651\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u6570\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5355\u7eaf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65c5\u6e38\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}

In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles\ngenerated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those\nobtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this\naccuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system\nunder test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by\nGP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in\ntheir accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving\nsystems with flaky behaviours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCPS\u57fa\u4e8e\u65ad\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528Ochiai\u7684GP\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6297\u6296\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684CPS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65ad\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8c31\u57fa\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff08DT\uff09\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff08DR\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7528Ochiai\u7684GP\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7cfb\u7edf\u6296\u52a8\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u4ec54%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65ad\u8a00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7528Ochiai\u7684GP\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6297\u6296\u52a8\u3002"}}

While various SR\nmodels in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they\noften fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions\nimpeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research\nhas explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance\nsession-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based\nmethods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to\nidentify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific\nfeedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning\nmethods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant\ncomputational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we\npresent multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:\n(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated\nrepresentations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and\n(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models.

Previous\nresearch on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as\nposition bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work\noften assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,\nneglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing\nbehaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR\nframework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal\nanalysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods\nare biased when different users have different preferences over queries and\npersonalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a\npersonalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score\nestimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models\nthe distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates\nuser-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We\ntheoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild\nassumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of\ncalculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression.

Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an\neffective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model\nweights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich\nsemantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in\nstandalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)\nremains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model\ncapacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to\nfine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse\nintervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a\nlightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge\ndevices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to\naggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging\ncan corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me\n(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others\nand partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by\nbalancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense\nreasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x\nhigher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFederated Representation Fine - Tuning (FedReFT)\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3ReFT\u5728FL\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faABM\u805a\u5408\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "ReFT\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165FedReFT\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5e72\u9884\u5c42\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAll - But - Me (ABM)\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a5\u6536\u5176\u4ed6\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u90e8\u5206\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u548cGLUE\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cFedReFT\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u9886\u5148\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad87 - 15\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FedReFT\u548cABM\u805a\u5408\u662f\u89e3\u51b3ReFT\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling\ncontinuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals\nfor machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance.

To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward\nLearning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a\nself-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a\nreward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,\nmulti-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT\nand RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data\nalready surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.\nCrucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and\ncross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based\nmethods.

Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation\nduring language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck\nin attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm\nto calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more\neffectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to\nprovide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.\nExtensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2\nmodels demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the\ntraining of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance\ndegradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.\nThis work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and\nfiner-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves\nthe training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling\nfaster development and iteration of large language models.

In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field\nshould be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,\ngathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its\ncontent into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable\nto bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied\nremedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate\nover-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,\nthe proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with\nlikely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across\nselected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without\nadding more layers.

However, the validity of LLMs as\nproxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates\nLLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining\ndyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a\nmoderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two\nlevels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.\nResults reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,\nan equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges.

This paper explores the current\nlandscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical\nresearch context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of\nrecent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\\'c et\nal., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and\nevaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of\nself-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy\nand full-proof validity.\n  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI\ninto the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented\nmathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical\nguidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding\nprinciples for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore\nseven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from\ncreativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these\nprinciples translate into concrete practice.\n  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than\nautomation.

However, manual segmentation of PVS is\ntime-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing\nautomated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to\ngeneralize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted\nMedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,\nfor automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a\nhomogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human\nConnectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous\nT1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model\nperformance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and\nleave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV).

In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies.

Physical layer\nauthentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel\ncharacteristics.

In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based\nphysical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile\nscenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation\nusing IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated\nbased on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance\ncorrelation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of\nmanually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial\ncorrelation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their\nsimilarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and\nexperimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT\ndevelopment kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both\nsimulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization\nperformance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent\nauthentication performance.

Project page:\n  https://sites.google.com/view/ditree", "summary": "Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free\ntrajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems.

In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically\nequivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL\nobjectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off\nwithout further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG\nconsistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various\narchitectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human\npreferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.\nFurthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby\noffering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our\napproach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing\nand controlling diffusion model alignment at inference.

This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent\nspace, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.\nConsequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D\nmicrostructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural\ndescriptors and material properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMicroLad\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u6750\u6599\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d3D\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece2D\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa3D\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u9006\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u6784 - \u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u8054\u9762\u4e343D\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MicroLad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u91cd\u5efa3D\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6570\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\uff08SDS\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6570\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u9879\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d3D\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u7f16\u78012D\u5207\u7247\u3002", "result": "MicroLad\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fde\u8d2f3D\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece2D\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u9006\u63a7\u5236\u76842D - 3D\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u548c\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e7f\u9614\u76843D\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

As\nmodalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail\nto fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits\nrelevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle\nhateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in\ncombination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model\nfor HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from\nspeech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features\nextracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an\nearly feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key\nconfigurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities\nin the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen\ntext is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.\nExperiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,\non-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the\nmodalities.

To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert\nknowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable\nqualification strategies in engineering informatics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u5f81\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u91d1\u5c5e\u57fa\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9274\u5b9a\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u8fdb\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u9274\u5b9a\u662f\u5de5\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u5de5\u827a\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b9a\u5236\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u89c6\u89c9 - \u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff08VLRs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08CLIP\u548cFLAVA\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Z\u5206\u6570\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u91d1\u5c5e\u57fa\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aFLAVA\u89c6\u89c9\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9ad8\uff0cCLIP\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9274\u5b9a\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u9274\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging\nconditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models\nperform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift\nand high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,\nand influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in\nartworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings\nwith those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate\nnotable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show\nthat foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are\nineffective.

However, the\nrarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of\ndeep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain\nrandomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a\nsynthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations\nfrom healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without\nrequiring pathological annotations.\n  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with\nCCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on\nCCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with\nother pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically\nrelevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show\ntheir utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed\naugmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in\nhealthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these\nquantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological\nconsistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable\nshape-based analyses.

To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel\nzero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with\nspatial information for target object reasoning.

Accepted at IWCS 2025", "summary": "A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel\nmeanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.\nVision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,\nhowever, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of\ncomposition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a\nVLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or\na blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails\nto capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained\nsignificant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot\nclassifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively\nwith CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the\ngenerative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation\nabilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --\nDiffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with\nattributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised\nzero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion\nClassifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models\nstruggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader\nchallenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings\nsuggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of\nrelational concepts such as left and right.

These\nblack-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on\nshallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly\ndecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language\ncausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human\ncognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level\nvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and\nlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal\nChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,\nand a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in\nthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a\nscalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing\ndatasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation\nmetric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and\ngeneralization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine\nacross diverse domains.

Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMixture of Contexts (MoC)\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u56e0\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e8c\u6b21\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8def\u7531\u6a21\u5757MoC\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u5757\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u663e\u8457\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "MoC\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}
