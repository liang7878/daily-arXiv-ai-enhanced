In\npractice, opinion formation is also based on information about the state of the\nworld and persuasion efforts. In this paper, we analyze an approach of Bayesian\npersuasion in the FJ model. There is an unknown state of the world that\ninfluences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal\ninformation about the state to all agents. The agents update their\npreconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose\nalgorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various\naspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we\nshow that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class\nof range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We\nprovide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of\npreconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a\npolynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This\ngeneralizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or\ninstances with a logarithmic number of ranges. In general, we show that\nsubadditive range-based objectives allow a simple n-approximation, and even for\nadditive ones, obtaining an $n^{1-c}$-approximation is NP-hard, for any\nconstant $c > 0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Friedkin - Johnsen\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bf4\u670d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u8fd8\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bf4\u670d\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bf4\u670d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u56f4\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b50\u52a0\u6027\u548c\u52a0\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u610f\u89c1\u5f62\u6210\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

It is typically\nachieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total\nprivacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of\nqueries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not\nmaintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many\napplications.

The classical\n$\\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton\n[2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\\ell_2$ heavy hitters using\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 n}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is\noptimal for streams with deletions.

To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a\nnovel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links\nbetween vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs.

By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,\ninvariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on\ndouble-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear\nfeature learning without explicit mappings.\n  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse\nbut also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.\nEmpirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and\nImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly\nstrong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP\nvisualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better\nisometry and class separation.

To this end, we introduce two novel\ndatasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content\nratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from\nthe Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines\nfan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our\nOwn.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u826f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u542b\u654f\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u89e6\u654f\u611f\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408MovieLens\u8bc4\u5206\u6570\u636e\u548cDoes the Dog Die?\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u4eba\u5c0f\u8bf4\u4e92\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u548cArchive of Our Own\u7684\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u8b66\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u542b\u654f\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u542b\u76f8\u5173\u654f\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8d85\u8d8a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal\ncomponents regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and\nselection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).\nThis model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant\ninformation, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in\nspecific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal\nset of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the\ncognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that\nallow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal\ncomponent, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely\nto be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we\npropose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which\nintegrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity\nframework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply\nthe models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and\nemotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity\nranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification\nperformance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\\% improvement in cross-validated\ndeviance $R^2$ and 7.3\\% improvement in cross-validated AUC.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances\ntheir capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert\nbranches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large\nnumber of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially\nin resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More\nimportantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a\nprefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage\nwhere only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a\nuniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.\nTo address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that\nexplicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert\nscheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a\ntwo-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the\ncomputation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the\ndecode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from\nactivation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,\nwithout requiring any changes to the model.

Despite their success, LLM-based\nmethods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.\n(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window\nstrategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the\nnumber of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or\nselection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and\nincrease input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nnovel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking\n(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes\nquery-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced\nby external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings\nto produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute\nrelevance scores in a single decoding step.

Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external\nbehavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable\ncost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding\nwhy developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may\nsupport wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We\nperformed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring\nactivity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying\nmotivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous\nmotivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in\n80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They\nenriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting\nreadability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were\npragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related\nto developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation\nwith motivation categories was weak. Conclusions.

Deep learning\nhas demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model\nnon-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data\nwill degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint\ndistribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied\nnormalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby\nachieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful\ncharacteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the\nover-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and\nnon-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (\nNSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization\nand non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the\npredictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from\none-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden\nperiodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of\nover-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.\n125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for\nvalidation.

Thus, if\nfault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear\nproblems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent\nbreakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for\nsolving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single\ncondition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to\ndissipation.

In this work, we correct technical issues with this and\nother prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of\nways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems\nto a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic\nLyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent\n$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we\nextend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where\nconserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results\nfor the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that\nefficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems\nthan previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator\nproblems of exponential size.

To address these issues, MSIGOA\nproposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between\nexploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which\neffectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global\nexploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two\nadaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm\nand promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based\nrestart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima\nand avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve\nthe exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior\nconvergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the\nparameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the\nproposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and\nCEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic\nGOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the\nproportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,\nrespectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than\nother algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively.

With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as\nthe testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting\nmethods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create\na web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script\ngeneration from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the\neffectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual\npenetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths\nalong the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,\nincluding ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while\nLLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be\ncontrolled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study\nadds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its\neffect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982PentestGPT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5353\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u548cAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b89\u5353\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b89\u5353\u6a21\u62df\u5668Genymotion\u8fdb\u884c\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u7684Rooting\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u96c6\u6210OpenAI API\u521b\u5efaWeb\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86AI\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u3002"}}

Evaluations show that veScale\ndelivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like\nTorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving\nsingle-device-equivalent results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdveScale\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528SPMD\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SPMD\u5728\u5373\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5e76\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5411\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6613\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684SPMD\u7f16\u7a0b\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46SPMD\u5728\u5373\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u6709\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u7247\u7b97\u5b50\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11PyTorch\u539f\u8bed\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "veScale\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u9ad8\u67092.2\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e78.4%\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5355\u8bbe\u5907\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "veScale\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SPMD\u5728\u5373\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f20\u91cf\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

XRAI analysis\nreveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized\nhotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal\nboundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.\nHowever, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults\nachieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like\nsoiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations\nimposed by thermal imaging resolution.

In addition to the kernelized evidence lower\nbound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation\nconstraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the\nmodel's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction\naccuracy with bounded uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u7a00\u758f\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5e7f\u4e49\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6838\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u9879\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u603b\u80fd\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ece\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u7a00\u758f\u8f9b\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5171\u8f6d\u52a8\u91cf\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u7528\u6838\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\u635f\u5931\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b88\u6052\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9879\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u91cd\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u6863\u672a\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u53ca\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

This work establishes a framework for clinically viable\nLLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,\nand regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a\nscalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5c0f\u7ec6\u80de\u80ba\u764c\uff08NSCLC\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6307\u5357\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u60a3\u8005\u60c5\u51b5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u764c\u75c7\u6cbb\u7597\u6307\u5357\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6848\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0cLLM\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u6b65\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaNSCLC\u60a3\u8005\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709LLM\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u91ca\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08Spearman\u7cfb\u6570r = 0.88\uff0cRMSE = 0.08\uff09\uff1b\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684AUROC\u4e3a0.800\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6307\u5357\u9075\u5faa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,\nis regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging\napplications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate\nboth sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified\nplatform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate\nfrequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,\nintegrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly\noptimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant\ncomputational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or\noptimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,\nDL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced\ncomputational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating\nunder limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time\nsystems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal\nsolutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including\nwaveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data\ndemodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these\nadvantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC\nsystem design.

However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical\nactivity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and\nregion-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from\n45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn\naccelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was\nmeasured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using\n>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive\nperformance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable\nlinear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related\ncovariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup\neffects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive\ndomains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.\nThese associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among\nparticipants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with\nsubcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as\nregional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and\nperceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day\nwas associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the\nmidday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings\nacross subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is\nassociated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in\nlater life.

Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain.

A novel element of this work is the integration of a\ncomplexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using\nLempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the\nstructural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a\nconsistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To\ninvestigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed\nsynthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.\nThese included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to\nsimulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of\nbiological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data\nreveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the\ninteraction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the\nLZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or\nnoisy signals.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases.

This study investigates the added value of unstructured\ncrash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with\nstructured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the\nnarratives, and their effectiveness was compared.

Based on the review, a\nconcept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered\nas an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of\nneeds that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the\nexternal world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in\nrelation to this world in order to satisfy these needs.

While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in\nsingle-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous\nenvironments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often\nconstrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address\nthese challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the\noverall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces\non extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by\nmitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,\n\\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load\nacross the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \\textit{dynamic\nparameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA\nadapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge\nretention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks\nsuch as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying\nexclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains\nperformance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when\naugmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves\ncompetitive performance while requiring only 80\\% of the single-task\nenvironment interaction steps.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones.

DischargeSim simulates post-visit,\nmulti-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with\ndiverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).\nInteractions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and\nassessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge\nevaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries\nand structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a\ndownstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant\ngaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across\npatient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education\noutcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.\nDischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit\nclinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165DischargeSim\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u51fa\u9662\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51fa\u9662\u6559\u80b2\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u603b\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8bca\u540e\u652f\u6301\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51fa\u9662\u6c9f\u901a\u662f\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DischargeSim\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8bca\u540e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "18\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51fa\u9662\u6559\u80b2\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u603b\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6559\u80b2\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DischargeSim\u4e3a\u8bca\u540e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of\ncurrent clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a\ndual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict\ngestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,\nencompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates\nboth global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was\nbenchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements\nobtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning\narchitectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute\nerror. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm\nclassification.

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users\ncan synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other\neasily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate\ntopic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and\nincreasing the likelihood of success.\n  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated\nphishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a\nresult, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify\nthem reliably.

We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about\n53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115\nadjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming\napproximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our\nmethod's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against\nother metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,\nproduct quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.\nAmong these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in\nclassifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where\nwe try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one\nanother for each adjective separately.

Among these,\nSFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into\nstructured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly\nestablished methodology for effective training data selection. Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable\ntraining data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods\ntypically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and\nincurring additional costs for prompt design.\n  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal\nRepresentations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by\nanalyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes\nsimilarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final\nhidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that\nwere largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide\nrange of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.\nMoreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity\nwith the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.\nExperiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less\nfamiliar data leads to better generalization performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKAMIR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7528\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKnowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations (KAMIR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u592a\u719f\u6089\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "KAMIR\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer\ndevice-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for\nphotonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip\narea cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI\nworkloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by\ntolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems.

Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality.

This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video\ndataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.\nIt includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects\nusing two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion\ncapture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all\ndevices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal\nalignment.

We find that although existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple\nknowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the\nissue of \"edit skipping\", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in\ninference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of\nknowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity\nof LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing\nmethod with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single\nedited facts and entire edited cases.

Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT\nimages, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention\nconvolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention\nrollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean\ncurvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in\ncombination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed\nedges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also\nyielding desirable classification performance.

This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies\nand filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more\nproductive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated\npenetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and\nGPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with\n103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our\nproposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\\%, 72.8\\%, and\n78.6\\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.\nComparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using\nself-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\\%, 16.5\\%, and 75.7\\% of subtasks and\nrequired 86.2\\%, 118.7\\%, and 205.9\\% more model queries.

Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal\nXSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to\nmodality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the\nmultimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,\ndeeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both\nheart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of\nrelapses and the prediction of the RFS time.

However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic\noften results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in\ngenerated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual\ndebugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness\nand security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces\nnew attack surfaces.\n  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in\nRetrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency\nhijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden\nmalicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting\ndual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM\nsuggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel\nattack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam\nsearch optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in\nretrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate\njailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious\ndependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and\nJavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for\npopular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able\nto succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both\ncustom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply\nchain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security\nalignment for code generation tasks.

Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases.
